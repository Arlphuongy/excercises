A candle and no cake? For real?
A cake made of light and human warmth. Mother Moon's new recipe.
I helped her make it.
Hooray, Vicenza!
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
Thanks, Mom.
Eighteen orbits around the Sun.
Eighteen years old. Now you have an adult daughter.
Oh my Goddess! What was your wish?
To know who my dad is, obviously.
Oh, sweetie.
Even on your 18th birthday, you're making that same old wish?
Yes!
Doesn't it move you?
Don't you understand how much this means to me?
Of course I do, honey.
And it still doesn't move you, me wanting to know who my dad is?
Nope. Not even a little bit.
-You think you're always right, huh? -But I am!
Come on, Mom. I have the right to know.
Baby, it's not the right moment. The Moon isn't aligned with Jupiter.
You're so insensitive, you know?
Sweetie, Mommy needs to talk to you!
I have nothing to say.
You can just listen. I'll do the talking.
-I had a dream. -Here it comes.
No, I won't make you hug any goats.
Twelve goats, Mom! It was 12 goats!
Yeah, 12 goats. Anyway, I dreamt of a letter.
The letter "I" for a country. So I thought… Iran? Iraq? Ireland? Italy?
So I thought… Iran? Iraq? Ireland? Italy?
But I know. I can feel it's India. You know I can feel this kind of stuff.
Yeah, I know, Mom. But couldn't it be, I don't know,
Israel? Iceland? Indonesia?
Nope. It is India.
I can feel something is there.
-Will you come? -Is Dad there?
No.
Then, no. Thank you.
You know what, Mom?
I think there's something for you to learn in India,
and it'll be good to take a break from each other.
Vicenza Shakti Pravananda Oxalá Sarahara Zalala da Silva.
Is this how you speak to your mother? Or of India?
Haven't I taught you we have to respect India?
India is a state of mind, a quantum consciousness.
It's here. Inside you, inside me,
inside all of us.
Vicenza!
-Happy birthday, Vicenza. -Happy birthday.
Thank you.
-Happy birthday, Vicenza! -Happy birthday!
Thank you, girls!
-Happy birthday, Vicenza! -Gratitude!
-Happy birthday, Vicenza. -Gratitude!
Happy birthday, Vicenza!
Happy birthday, Vicenza.
-Thank you. -Happy birthday, Vicenza.
-Happy birthday, Vicenza! -Gratitude.
-Happy birthday, Vicenza. -Thank you.
Happy birthday, Vicenza!
Thank you!
I knew I would find you here!
Happy birthday, Vicenza!
I wish you many Moons! Thousands of Moons!
I brought you a gift.
Thank you, Mother Moon!
Here. It has aloe, spinach, yautía.
Everything to moisturize your hair. It's looking so dull.
So dull.
Is that you?
Yes. I'm trying to finish it, but I can't.
You have to know yourself better before making a self-portrait.
That's true, Mother Moon.
But how can I do that if I don't know who my dad is?
Can you talk to Mom?
I've talked to her a thousand times. But you know how Raion is.
She doesn't listen, even to me, when we discuss this.
Oh, Mom! Enjoy your trip!
Mom. Safe travels, okay? Take care.
Of course. Oh, honey, I'm gonna miss you so much!
Me too.
-Raion! -Huh?
Mother Moon! Get her safely to the airport, okay?
No problem. But we're late, girl! Super late!
Hold on. Just a second.
Blessed be the Moroccan angels, the shamanic healing,
the odorless Erê.
And blessed be Nature, which takes care of all that.
We are guided by Her.
Perfect.
Blessed be the lettuce sprout!
And one more thing.
If you feel the need to do something insane--
and listen well, I didn't say "want," I said "need"--
then listen to your heart.
Because if your heart, and only your heart,
compels you to insanity…
-Then do it. Have faith and do it. -Okay!
Oh, honey.
I love you so much, sweetie!
Bye!
RIO CARNIVAL 2002 SANTA TERESA BLOCO RAION AND PACO
"Santa Teresa's Troupe. Raion and Paco."
COSMIC UNIVERSE
FOR SALE
How much is it?
Three hundred. Thank you.
-A ticket to Rio de Janeiro, please. -Okay.
You can go that way.
Hey, lady!
Why are people giving me money?
What?
-Aren't you begging? -No!
Not that I don't need it…
Do you know where Santa Teresa is?
-Gratitude! -Good luck!
For real.
Amoeba's party!
-What's up? Listen, Naked Amoeba. -The party!
-In two weeks! -We're gonna have music!
Bring family, friends. You'll love it!
Excuse me. Naked Amoeba's party. It's in two weeks, okay?
We're gonna have music. I'll be playing too.
Yeah, other people will play too. Hey, guys, what's up?
Naked Amoeba's party, okay? It's in two weeks.
-We're gonna have music. -Naked Amoeba. In two weeks.
It'll be like a rave.
Yeah, we're gonna have live music!
Naked Amoeba!
-It's for our budget! -Come to the party, everybody!
Hey! Be careful, you dummy!
Hey! Be careful, you dummy! -Sorry. -You almost made me fall.
-I know. Sorry. -Be careful.
Jeez, what are you looking at?
Nothing.
-Hello. -Hey.
-Where is this address? -It's here.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
PACO'S STUDIO
Yes? What do you want so early in the morning?
It's 2:15 p.m.
Good afternoon!
Whoa. She's a hugger.
I'm looking for Paco.
Paco? Is it about classes?
-Yes! It's about classes! -Great. Come on in.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
Wait! Hang on, not so fast.
Paco!
Paco!
Why are you yelling, Josie?
It's Jade. Ja-de.
Jade.
That girl wants to talk to you.
-Who is she? -I have no idea.
-Hello. How are you? -Hey, Paco.
I'm here to talk about classes.
Today is Saturday.
-Today is Saturday. -I came a long way to meet you.
Look, you can come back on Monday, and we'll talk, okay?
Paco, I screwed up. Come here quickly.
Just a minute. He'll be right with you, okay?
Sorry for butting in, but you haven't sold a painting in a while.
These classes have been helping you pay the bills.
Let me tell you a secret. I don't like to teach.
I hate push-ups, but I do them. That's how it works.
Go talk to her.
Go. Move.
-You said you came a long way? -Ten hours on a bus.
I'm making an exception for you.
Just give me a minute to freshen up.
Vicenza!
My name is Vicenza.
It's the mix of "Vicente" and "Zana," my maternal grandparents.
Don't touch that.
Don't touch that, okay?
Tell me, why do you want to take classes?
It's because I'm having trouble with my self-portrait.
-I think I have art block. -Welcome to the club.
I haven't painted anything in five years.
-Really? -Yes.
But it's normal.
Let me tell you, I don't have enough patience to teach.
So I handpick my students, the ones I think are worthy.
Do you have anything to show me?
No, but I can draw you a sketch.
-No, there's no need. -No big deal.
Hey, there's no need.
Look…
You don't need to, okay?
Is that me?
Right. So come back on Monday.
Okay? Come on. I'll walk you to the door.
Paco?
I'm Raion's daughter.
Raion's?
Raion's daughter?
No way!
Do you remember this Carnival?
I do.
Of course I do.
-You were 30 years old, right? -Yeah.
I think I was 30.
And now you're 48?
Yes, but I don't look 48, right? People say I look 40.
Raion…
It must be the beard.
People lie, Paco.
What about Raion? Is she still living in that village? The Namaste?
Cosmic Universe.
Cool.
I may be your daughter, Paco.
Paco.
Look, I can't wait for you, okay? I'm heading out.
Bye, cutie.
-Bye. -Bye.
Call me, okay? Never mind, I'll call you.
Are you going to remain silent?
I just wanna know if I should grab some water, tea…
No, I…
Well…
Raion never said anything. She never reached out…
Can I talk to her?
She's in India, out of reach.
-I see. -Do you want something?
-Are you okay? -Huh? A pillow.
-What? -A pillow. Just a pillow.
Okay.
I'm going out.
-Where to? -I don't know.
Can I go with you?
Where's your mother, again?
I don't know.
-What about you? Where are you staying? -Nowhere.
God, it gets worse. Come, I'll take you to a place nearby.
But my bag, Paco!
I'll grab it!
I'll grab it! Done!
-Let's go! -Calm down!
Breathe.
I just wanted to meet you.
Nice to meet you. Ready?
Let's go.
Come.
Let's go.
-Arthur! -Hey!
I'm here!
Hey, Arthur. You good?
-Yes. -Yeah?
-This is… -Vicenza.
Vicenza, Arthur.
-Arthur, Vicenza. -How are you?
Vicenza needs our help. Do you have a room?
Any room available? I can pay you later.
Vicenza?
-Take my number. -I didn't bring my phone.
-What? -I don't use it much. I didn't bring it.
She doesn't use her phone.
Right. If anything happens, call me.
Okay? Arthur knows how to find me. Bye.
Look, don't worry. He's always like that.
Welcome.
-Thanks. -Come, I'll show you to your room.
Coming!
-Is it Monday already? -No.
I came to see if you wanted me to make you breakfast.
We can get to know each other.
Here. You'll feel better.
Sheesh, you're trying to kill me.
Trust me. It's good for you.
This juice is good for headaches, stomachaches, stress--
Fine. If I drink it, will you be quiet?
-Quiet. -Okay.
Before I forget…
I got a phone for you.
It's my old phone.
Okay?
If you want to talk to me, just give me a call.
-Do you know how to use it? -Yes.
But this one is better than mine.
I get it. You want to sleep, so you want me to go.
Yes. Could you? Great.
-We can talk later, okay? -Okay.
Perfect.
The juice!
You're welcome.
For what?
What do you mean by that?
Did I say you could go through my stuff?
Did I?
Sorry, I--
What did you do to my house? What's all this? Look at my table!
-Weren't you leaving? -Paco, I just wanted to help.
Did I ask for your help?
No, but I thought that mess was blocking your inspiration.
Blocking my inspiration?
Now the energy will flow. The creativity will come back! You'll see!
I'll show you how I get energy to flow.
Get out!
Get out!
We'll fine-tune it until the party. Thanks, guys.
Today was great, huh?
-Hey! -You weren't here earlier, were you?
No. And you're the new guest?
Cool!
-Already wearing your Carnival costume! -No.
No? Sorry.
I'm not used to talking to the opposite sex.
Especially when they're pretty, right? I mean, no.
Yes, you are. Not that you're not pretty. You are beautiful, actually.
I'm Arthur's grandson. Arthur is my grandfather.
If I'm his grandson, he's obviously… Nice to meet you. I'm Cadu.
Vicenza.
How can I help you, Vicenza? Do you need anything?
Hey, Cadu. I've chosen my instrument for the troupe. A tuba.
Cool, but I'm in the middle of a conversation.
You can listen too. Check this out.
It sounds clogged, but I'll fix it.
So? What do you think?
-Why not pick something easier? -Why? You didn't like it?
-I did! -Really?
Who's the weirdo in the costume?
First, my name is Vicenza. Second, this is not a costume.
And third,
you suck at playing the tuba.
You're like the worst tuba player I've ever heard.
And I don't understand why someone would lie to you about that.
So, Vicenza, I'm gonna go, okay?
If you want to get my number from Cadu, princess,
I can give you tuba lessons.
Right.
Cadu, give her my number, okay? Thanks.
Let me tell you something serious. Cadu, hear me out.
This thing of yours, of always telling the truth,
it's rare nowadays, okay? It's like a gift.
When you have a gift, share it with the world.
If you don't, you know what happens, right?
-What? -Bad things! Life snakes! Sorry.
Thanks. Big Nose, give me your drum so I can beat on it!
"Life snakes" means "life makes you pay."
That's Nando for you. Such a character.
-You complimented me. You're handsome too. -Me?
Thanks. No girl has ever said that to me.
-Really? -Yes.
I wish that was caught on camera because nobody will believe me.
Yo, weirdo.
You're all chummy with my brother, but Paco is dead broke.
How will he pay for your lodging?
What is this? Is this how you talk to people?
She's right. I don't wanna stay here at Paco's expense.
But that doesn't justify your behavior. Shall we try again?
Betina, this is Vicenza. Vicenza, this is my sister Betina.
-Where's the money? -She's the treasurer.
-Have you noticed? -Yeah.
Look, I don't have money right now, but I can find another way to pay.
I can teach yoga, for example.
I can also fix stuff, clean, paint--
-Do you know how to sew? -I'm great at it.
Wonderful! She can sew our banner!
Okay, and she can fix the sink.
No need for that. You know that's impossible, Betina.
Nothing is impossible for Vicenza.
Show me the sink.
-How long have you lived here? -Since my parents died.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, don't worry.
Come to think of it, ten years is a long time, living with my grandpa and sister.
-What about your grandma? -My grandma…
-I haven't seen her in five, six years. -Oh, wow.
No need for "Oh, wow." She wanted to leave.
She left my grandpa in debt, stole money from the troupe, and he's never gotten over that.
stole money from the troupe, and he's never gotten over that.
So he fills up the place with guests and classes
as a way to pay the bills and to keep his mind busy, right?
Exactly. And that's why Betina and I want to revive the troupe.
To see if it'll cheer him up or something.
But we're trying to make it more current.
We don't want to do samba or marchinha.
Betina thinks it's old-fashioned. Everybody does it like that.
We want to try something new, with some electronic music.
I know, I don't like the idea either, but I was outvoted.
We'll even throw a rave to raise money.
-It's gonna be cool. -What's up, Cadu?
-Lucinha! How are you? You good? -I've missed you!
Lucinha, this is Vicenza. Vicenza, Lucinha.
-Hi. -How are you?
She's staying here with us.
Wow, is there going to be a costume party?
No, these are just my clothes.
No, these are just my clothes. You're so cute.
You're a real hippie, huh?
You and Cadu are dating, huh?
No, Lucinha. It's not like that. She--
Hush! Just be grateful, okay? This guy here can't even catch a cold.
So seeing Little Cadu with someone is a miracle.
It's a sign that things work out when we have enough faith.
-Hallelujah, my Lord! -What rave has no lighting?
No! Of course not!
No, I don't care! I need more lights, period!
Hey, Betina. Look what I made.
Oh, it's looking good!
-I like it. -Thanks.
-Did you make it? -Yeah.
That's looking so nice!
Vicenza.
Someone wants to see you.
Can we talk for a bit?
You have every reason to be mad at me.
I'm glad you know that.
Yeah…
I shouldn't have talked to you like that. Never.
Not that this justifies how rude I was,
not even in the slightest, of course, but my life isn't,
like, it isn't great right now.
Actually, it's pretty bad.
I feel very frustrated, very angry.
I haven't felt inspired for a long time. I'm broke.
I don't have anything.
So I think I ended up
lashing out at you with my temper.
Sorry.
I have to apologize as well.
I shouldn't have barged into your home.
Yeah, it even told me it misses you.
My home.
But seriously, will you forgive me?
Sure.
I'd like to start over from scratch.
We pretend nothing happened
and just start over.
-Do you wanna go for a stroll? -A stroll?
-Do you wanna go for a stroll? -A stroll? -Yeah! -How cute! Okay, let's go.
-Yeah! -How cute! Okay, let's go.
Yeah? Go grab your swimsuit.
Okay.
-Your mother is a very special woman. -I know.
Very special.
I remember her well. She came to Santa Teresa for a retreat
and stayed through Carnival.
We didn't date for long. We hung out for, like, three weeks.
Not even a month. She loved this place I'm taking you to now.
I think you'll love it too.
The water is great!
So, tell me, what are you planning to do
about me possibly being your dad?
I told you. I just want to get to know you.
-But that's what we're doing, right? -Yes.
That's why I brought you here.
-Do you have any kids? -No.
-I've never wanted any. -Why?
Raising a child is a serious thing. It's complicated.
I've never thought I had what it takes to be a father.
I've never thought I was responsible enough
to raise someone.
But it's responsible of you to think of that.
It's crazy, isn't it? Fate giving you a daughter out of nowhere.
It's very crazy.
But I'm really enjoying it.
Seriously.
I've always dreamed about eating a burger and drinking soda.
How come? Have you never had one?
I've never eaten meat.
Why didn't you tell me? We could've gone somewhere else.
I really wanted to try
your favorite burger.
And you talked about it with so much joy,
I didn't want to disappoint you.
-Is it good? -It tastes like feet.
But it's good.
Listen. After this, I'll take you to see the statue of Drummond.
Do you know where it is? In Copacabana, near Posto Seis…
Are you okay?
No! But I will be!
Vicenza?
Vicenza?
Are you-- Is everything okay?
No!
I really don't have anything. Water, expired yogurt, eggs, and soda.
There's really nothing to make tea?
-Yeah. -Peppermint?
Lemon balm? Chamomile? Ginger?
-Keep talking. -About tea?
Yeah.
Fennel?
Boldo? Lemongrass? Hibiscus?
Are you going to paint?
Keep talking.
Mulungu.
Guaçatonga.
Espinheira santa.
-Star anise. -Star anise.
Here.
See how tidying up the house helped?
You think that tidying up the house is what helped me?
Let's paint together.
I've never painted with someone.
Neither have I.
Shall we?
-Let's do this. -Let's do it.
-It's beautiful. -Yeah.
And do you have a boyfriend at Cosmic Universe?
A girlfriend?
A partner?
-No? -Let's continue painting.
Okay.
Cadu!
Cadu! Hey. What happened?
I found something that can change my life.
Do you know this man?
Of course I do!
It's Giovanne. He used to come over all the time.
I mean, he's been gone for a long time now.
But he and Paco were really close friends.
Do you remember his last name?
It was an Italian surname.
Pavaro… No, not Pavarotti.
It starts with B…
-Benizatto! -Benizatto.
"Giovanne Benizatto, two 'T's," as he used to say.
And you never heard from him again?
It's been a while.
Someone once told me he was working
in the financial market, dealing with stocks and stuff.
So, he might work at Leader Bank?
Yes. Maybe he's the owner.
So that's it. I found him.
I found out where he works.
-Can you take me there? -Sure.
Thank you, Grandpa.
-Take care. -Thanks.
Vicenza, can I ask why it is so important for you to meet this Giovanne?
Because he could be my father.
I could have sworn Paco was my father.
Hold on. Paco?
So, I found a picture that my mother had been keeping
since Carnival 2002, of her and Paco.
That's why I came here.
Then I found out Giovanne was also with my mom
during the same Carnival.
And in the picture from the troupe, they were kissing!
In the picture of my mom and Paco, they're just hugging.
I have to meet him, Cadu.
You will meet him. I promise I'll help you, okay?
It'll be an honor.
Have you thought about how you're gonna get in?
Huh? Can't I simply go in?
No, there's security and--
Cadu, I'm following my heart. Relax.
When I do this, things work out for me.
Always. In a very crazy way.
Nothing can go wrong now.
Sure.
Good morning. Name, please.
Vicenza Shakti Pravananda Sarahara Oxalá Zalala da Silva.
Silva. Okay.
Where are you going?
I'm heading to Leader Bank.
Okay, which floor?
I don't know.
You don't? How will I tell them you're here?
Could you not tell them?
That is what I'm paid for.
Ma'am, the person I came to see doesn't know I exist,
and I didn't know about his existence either.
-Do you understand? -No.
I came here to meet my father.
-What's his name? -Giovanne Benizatto.
Do you know him?
I don't.
But you are going to!
-Let's take a photo. -With me?
No, look here.
Done.
Good luck. Tenth floor, room 1002.
-Gratitude. -Gratitude for you too!
Can I help you?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Going up.
Tenth!
Tenth!
First floor.
Tenth!
Tenth.
Going up.
Wow, so cool. This box can fly.
Yes?
-Hi. I'm looking for Giovanne Benizatto. -Right there.
I know. I understand.
Lower your voice when talking to me. I told you you could lose money.
Lower your voice when talking to me!
-Can I help you? Looking for someone? -You.
-Me? And who are you? -Vicenza.
I'm Raion's daughter.
Raion?
I haven't heard from your mom in ages.
Have a seat.
And how is she?
Oh, she's great. So, I came here because--
You're in a bad financial situation, and you came to ask for advice.
Listen, you know I charge a small fortune to do this,
but for you, I'll do it for free.
For Raion.
You know I had a fling with your mother, right?
-Oh, wow. -Let's start.
What's your name, cutie?
It's Vicenza Shakti Pravananda Oxalá Sarahara Zalala da Silva.
Silva.
Mother's name. Raion…
-Silva. -Silva.
Father's name?
I don't have a father.
Okay.
Date of birth?
November 8th, 2002.
The same year you met my mom.
You could be my daughter, huh?
Could you be my daughter?
-Is that why you're here? -Yeah.
-Daughter? -Daughter.
-Daughter. -Daughter.
Daughter!
I think we need to talk, right?
Do you want to eat something? Are you hungry?
I'm always hungry.
But I don't want to eat at a restaurant. A homemade meal would be great.
I know exactly where to take you. Come.
Taxi!
Hi!
Wow!
Can you help me?
-Yes. -Here.
Funny. My stepsons never cooked with me.
I mean, ex-stepsons.
And have you ever invited them to cook with you?
Yeah.
I mean, I think so.
Got it.
Careful.
How many stepsons do you have?
Two. Guilherme and Rael.
Are they nice?
They're the coolest little guys I know.
-How long have you been divorced? -Two years.
-Are you still friends with their mother? -Marta?
Yes! Marta is
my very good friend.
Thanks.
Hey, don't you think it's crazy for us to come all the way to India
to watch a guy in Los Angeles on a Skype call?
He's not here in this infernal heat.
With these flies.
And we can't even kill the flies. It's not spiritually evolved to kill them.
Why did you take this long to come looking for me?
I was only able to run away now when my mom went to India.
What do you mean, run away?
Run away? Your mother doesn't know you're here?
Relax.
I came here following my heart. It's all right.
No, it's not all right. We're gonna call your mom now!
There's no way. She's out of reach.
Did you have to run away?
Raion didn't want you to meet me?
Actually, she didn't want to talk about you or anyone.
She would say, "It's not the time for you to meet your father."
-But it was never the time! -I see.
And you've grown tired of not knowing who your father is?
And you've grown tired of not knowing who your father is? Very tired.
Well…
Do you want more tea?
No, thank you. Actually, I think it's getting late.
-I have to go. -No, stay a little more.
It's raining.
Where are you staying?
At the headquarters of a troupe in Santa Teresa.
-The Naked Amoeba. Do you know it? -Wow.
I haven't been there in forever.
How about this?
You sleep here tonight, in Rael's bedroom,
and tomorrow morning, before I go to work, I'll take you there.
What the hell is this?
-Huh? What is this? -Hold on. I can explain.
You better explain, Giovanne.
It's not every day we come to your house,
and Rael finds Sleeping Beauty in his bed!
Well, this is Vicenza.
She might be my daughter.
What, Giovanne?
Your daughter, Giovanne? She may be your daughter?
-Daughter? -Relax!
-How can she be your daughter, Giovanne? -I'll explain outside.
Stop yelling!
-I can't believe it! -Are you going to live here?
Do you play Fortnite? Or FIFA?
Are you good at math?
No, I'm not gonna live here.
I don't know these video games.
And I'm great at math.
Don't disrespect me in front of the kids!
-Stop yelling, Marta! -You let a stranger inside the house!
Are you crazy?
Crazy? I talked to her!
Boys, I need to be alone for a bit to get changed. Can you excuse me?
-Of course. -Yeah.
Thank you.
Giovanne, wake up!
Have you thought about the money you have in the bank?
-What about it? -Giovanne!
It's obvious this girl is just thinking about your money!
Stop! Lower your voice!
I'm not going to! I'm out of--
Giovanne! You're irresponsible!
I don't regret divorcing you at all!
I don't regret it either!
I couldn't stay there with that woman accusing me.
Vicenza, I don't know why you care.
Little does she know you're an angel.
-Me? An angel? Really? -Yeah.
The most beautiful angel of all.
It's Paco. He wants to take me somewhere.
Are you gonna mention Giovanne?
Oh, Cadu. I don't know.
I don't want to hurt him.
I'm sure if I tell him, he'll be sad.
And I don't want to be the person that makes Paco sad.
But what about Giovanne? Are you going to mention Paco?
He's so cool.
Cadu, help me. I don't know what to do.
I think you should tell them the truth.
You're crazy, right, Cadu?
-Were you listening? -Betina.
Okay, I was listening. I love gossip. I can't resist.
If I were you, I wouldn't tell them.
But I hate to lie. I don't even know how to.
Oh, honey. Look.
First, you're not gonna lie. You'll just hide the truth.
And second, why would you risk everything you have with both of them?
Here.
I want to apologize. For Marta, for me.
-I never imagined that-- -It's fine.
Sometimes we say things without thinking, right?
Yeah.
But do you forgive me?
I forgive you. Where are the boys?
Oh, I asked them to come next week.
I needed to be alone.
My head is all over the place with this "possible daughter" thing.
You have to bring it!
You're breathing right, huh, Mr. Paco! You've learned!
I have a very good teacher. I'll give you her number later.
Smells great. Give it a try.
Vi, I'm sorry to ask, but are you not telling Paco or Giovanne?
I can't, Cadu. I don't want to hurt them.
I see. And what does your heart tell you? Don't you always listen to it?
Sometimes my heart is sure it's Paco,
but then it thinks it's Giovanne.
Then why don't you take a DNA test?
That will settle it. You know what that is, right?
Of course I do, Cadu!
I'm not an idiot. But doesn't it cost a fortune?
No. Not anymore.
It did in the past. But today it's pretty cheap.
Anyone can do it. I think there's a website.
No, it's an app. No, a website.
You gather information, look.
You just need to collect a few things, like blood, saliva, hair…
See? Just… Vi!
Vi! Careful!
-When you get to the top, jump. -Jump?
No, not this way, there.
When you get there, you jump. Wait, I'll help you. Hold on.
-I'm nearly there. -Yeah.
Jump. Yeah.
-Oh, so cool! -Sorry.
-Vi! -There's another one!
Vicenza, hold on.
Vi. Calm down, I know.
It's an escalator. It's something new. Look, I found the website.
It says here you just need a sample of blood, hair, or saliva,
and then you can figure out who's your father.
Vicenza, no. Enough escalators.
Yeah. And everything's healthy.
-I see. -Thank you.
Thank you.
You can use this straw. It's eco-friendly.
Okay. Let's do this.
Here, Cadu. Everything we need for the DNA test.
Okay. I'll take care of it for you.
Thank you.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
I don't know what I'm gonna do when you go home.
You're the most special girl I've ever met.
Little brother, we desperately need to promote the rave.
The ticket sales are terrible, and we need money for the street parade.
Let's print flyers and hand them out.
-Great. -Yeah.
Let's go.
My daughter's gone!
Do you understand what I'm saying? My daughter's gone!
Guys, how insensitive! I expected more from you!
What is this?
How do you expect me to be zen facing this situation? How horrible!
Hey!
-Hey. -Look what I brought.
I'll make a super juice.
For you.
It looks beautiful.
Thank you.
Check it out.
Amoeba Troupe's party. Wanna go?
Really? Do you want to go?
Why not? Am I too old?
Of course not, Paco.
-Use a little more orange. -Leave it to me.
Hey. There will be a party at your place, and you didn't even invite me?
Giovanne, how would I know you like electronic music?
I don't. But I'd love to see the troupe again.
Especially with you.
Wanna go?
Yeah! Let's go!
I bought a ticket.
You guys, I need your help.
I'll try to summarize, okay?
Listen, I never had a father.
Oh, poor girl!
But now I have two.
Wow, life is good!
I love them both. They're really cool.
They even know each other.
But neither can know the other could also be my dad.
And both are coming to our party.
Holy cow, you are screwed!
-Lucinha, girl, you're not helping. -Sorry. I feel for her.
-Lucinha, girl, you're not helping. -Sorry. I feel for her. -Right. What can we do to keep them apart? -I know!
Why don't we have a costume rave party?
Like rave meets Carnival?
That's genius!
Well done!
We'll leave a chest with costumes at the entrance
so people who don't have them can pick one up there.
-So there's no excuse. -Yeah! Masks, noses, wigs…
It'll make it harder for them to recognize each other.
You rock, Lucinha.
Yeah, for me to put it there.
Hold on, bro. Don't put the tuba here.
-I'm practicing! -Practicing? You can't even play!
For Christ's sake.
Betina, help me out here! Come help me, please!
Cadu is taking away the tuba! I was practicing…
That one looks weird.
Guys, the party is packed! You'll put the troupe in the streets!
We'll put the troupe in the streets!
I told you it would work, guys!
Betina, come here!
I'm coming. Hold on!
-I need to show you something. -Wait.
Vicenza!
I couldn't wait to see you. I have news.
Really? Tell me!
My art dealer told me we closed a deal with an exhibit
of my latest works in New York.
-No way! -Yeah!
That's awesome!
I'd like to thank you. You inspired me to start painting again.
Don't worry. It was nothing. Congratulations, Da-- Paco!
-You're coming with me, right? -To New York?
It wouldn't make sense for me to go alone.
Of course I'll go! When are you going?
February 9th.
-Is everything okay? -The Amoeba's parade is on the 9th.
And I helped with the flyers,
I sewed the banner, I helped with the party.
I'm doing everything so the troupe gets to parade, you know?
Of course.
Of course. You're happy. You helped to organize everything,
so you're happy.
-Are we good? -Sure.
We're good. If you're happy, I'm happy too.
Thank you.
Paco, I have something to take care of.
Hang out and enjoy the party. I'll be right back, okay?
Hi, Paco!
Hi, Luana!
It's Lucinha, Paco! Damn!
Vicenza! You look so good!
Thank you, Giovanne!
-You too. -So, did you like it?
-How about we improve it a little? -Yeah?
-This one? -Yes.
Let's see.
Oh my God. I think it's too much.
So? What do you think? Look.
-Am I killing it or what? -Gorgeous!
I look like someone who's taking his stepsons to Disneyland for the first time.
-That's amazing news! -Do you want to come with us?
-To Disneyland? Really? -Yeah!
Oh my God! Of course! Wow!
-When are you going? -February 9th.
-Nando! -Hey, Vicenza. You scared me.
Nando, this is Giovanne.
My friend.
Giovanne, this is Nando. He's our--
I'm the troupe's general musician.
-I play all the instruments. -Yeah.
-Giovanne loves music. -Do I?
-Do you like music? -I do, but…
Play for him.
You know our master, right? The master! That one…
-That sure is the master. -A classic, isn't it?
The party is packed, huh?
The party is amazing! I'm loving it!
Hey!
Hey!
-What's up? -All good?
-Yeah. -Yay.
I want a drink, please.
It's for Betina! Thanks. It's for Betina.
I'm watching you!
-Okay. -Be good!
Arthur!
Paco!
You look beautiful!
Hey, what's up?
-Hi, Vicenza! -Hi.
See you.
Thank you.
So, do you want a drink?
Well, Vicenza, the thing is, I'm driving and can't drink.
I think I'm gonna get water at the bar.
Hello. A sparkling water.
No, have a green juice.
Green juice? Are you sure?
I will be right back, okay?
-Okay. -Right.
Giovanne?
Arthur!
Oh my God! It's been so long!
The Great Arthur!
It's good to see you.
-It's great to see you. -I'll be right back, okay?
Behave yourself.
Hello? I want it now!
Hello?
Hey, girl. Have you seen Paco? No. Why?
Oh my God.
Cadu. I'm tired of all this.
Well, then why don't you come clean?
Right when the test results are coming out?
Vicenza?
Vicenza. I'm leaving, okay?
Okay.
Good job. Everything was fantastic.
Thank you.
You're welcome. It was really great.
-Get inside. It's getting cold. -But it's hot.
No, it's cold. You better get inside.
Put on something to cover your shoulders and neck too.
-Okay? -Okay.
Fine, then. Just get inside, okay?
-Okay. -But you're still outside!
You should get inside!
It's so windy out here. You're going to catch a cold!
You'll be in bed for three or four days!
-Bye, Paco! -Thank you, Paco!
Bye!
Vicenza.
I'm going home. I have to wake up early for work.
I loved it.
-Bye. -Bye.
Oh, Cadu! It all worked out!
I've never kissed before.
And I've never kissed someone I had such strong feelings for.
So our first kiss should be in a special place.
Yeah.
-Can Betina lend us her car? -She already did.
-Shall we? -Let's go.
Hey!
What the hell?
Hey!
Didn't you see me?
Are you insane?
You're the insane one! Almost ran me over!
Paco?
Giovanne?
Dude, it's been so long!
Yeah, it's been a while!
Dude! Are things going well?
Yeah. Well, things almost went badly.
-But yeah. -That's a big gulp.
Get in. I'll drive you home.
I'll get in, but I'm not going home.
We're going to an after-party!
My man. Behave yourself, okay?
Nice car.
Listen, thanks for not taking me home.
Let's go for a swim. Still scared of cold water?
Scared? Me? Please.
I'm terrified of it!
-It's so good to see you, man. -Totally.
Let's go for a swim.
What's wrong?
No, it's just the green juice I had at the party.
I have a great story to tell you. You won't believe it.
Go ahead, tell me.
I'll tell you in a bit.
-Isn't this place beautiful, Cadu? -It is.
But you know what is even more beautiful? You.
Hey!
Take your hands off my daughter! Take your hands off her.
Daughter? What daughter? She's my daughter!
-Buzz off, kid. -Excuse me?
Your daughter? What's this, Vicenza?
Calm down! I can explain!
How did you two meet?
Shut up!
I never knew who my father was,
then suddenly I had two.
Two dads?
What do you mean?
In the Naked Amoeba's archive, I found photos of you two with Mom.
So you went looking for Giovanne?
-He could be my dad too! -Why didn't you tell me about Paco?
-I didn't want to hurt you! -Hurt?
Hurt? Come on, Vicenza.
-You were misleading us? -Yes.
No!
She was trying--
Shut up!
Look. honestly,
I think she must be your daughter.
She's selfish, just like you.
And I think she's your daughter.
Insensitive.
Manipulative.
I introduced your mother to him!
-You never hooked up! -You know nothing!
-Guys, stop! Please! -Shut up!
-You're leaving, huh, Paco? -Whatever.
-You never grew up, did you? -No, I didn't.
Calm down, Vi.
-Cadu. -Calm down.
I love them so much!
Now I've lost both of them.
No, you haven't. They love you too.
Dammit, I told you this was not going to end well.
-Cadu, go away. -No, Vicenza. Why--
I have to be by myself. Go away, please.
Vicenza.
Ju!
What?
I'm going home.
Vicenza?
Vicenza, where were you? Why haven't you answered my calls?
I don't wanna talk.
I was super worried, and this is how you treat me?
You think I owe you anything, Cadu?
Yeah, I think you do.
Do you know how my mind is right now?
Do you know how it feels to have never had a father,
finding one,
then finding another one and immediately losing them both?
And have it all be your fault? Do you?
No, you don't.
-Vicenza. -Cadu.
Don't go.
Give her some time.
She needs to be alone.
You can talk tomorrow.
If I have to I will take a boat
I will row for six months like a fish Just to see you
There's no sea large enough
To scare me To make me give up on you
If I have to I will build a machine
Faster than doubt More sudden than a tear
I will travel at full power And in a moment of pain from missing you
I will be there to tell you That I came to see you
I want to share
I want to share the good life with you
I want to share
I want to share the good life with you
Vicenza, I…
What's going on?
Where are you going?
-I'm leaving. I don't belong here. -What?
My mother was right, Cadu. I wasn't supposed to meet my dad.
Are you sure?
Are those the results?
Vicenza…
My bad. Something is going on downstairs. You have visitors.
What's up, Cadu? See ya.
Mom?
Oh, sweetheart!
I missed you. Are you okay?
Yeah, I am.
Mother Moon!
Hi, everybody!
Mom, how did you find me?
I'm a mother.
I got home, and Paco's picture was gone.
I figured it all out and came to look for him.
Exactly. That's where I came in.
I was walking outside. I even mistook her for you.
When I saw it, it all made sense.
Everyone's wearing costumes. Check out Vicenza's troupe!
That's exactly what happened. But our cute moment is over now.
Vicenza, how dare you run away? That was insane!
Sorry. I know I shouldn't have.
Owning up to your mistakes is a beautiful sign of maturity, honey.
And Mommy has made mistakes too.
In India, I realized that I'm not that esoteric.
And, even though I'm your mother, I can't control your life
the way I would like to control it, unfortunately.
I learned that from the flies.
The flies?
Sweetie, there were so many flies everywhere.
And you couldn't even swat at them.
So, what did I learn?
That you can control yourself. But other people?
That's impossible.
If someone wants to kill a bunch of flies, they will.
I'll be forever grateful to the flies
for showing me that, contrary to what I've always said,
you have every right to meet your dad.
What is that?
It's the DNA test I did with Paco and Giovanne.
Giovanne too?
Yeah, I went looking for him too.
Oh, sweetie…
You guys!
We're screwed!
-What? -The stage bus has caught on fire!
Did anyone get hurt?
No one got hurt, but everything was on it.
-Including the money. -But how did that happen?
It seems the stage bus I rented couldn't handle that many lights.
Dammit, Betina.
Hey!
Everything happens for a reason. Right, Mother Moon?
-Mother Moon? -What?
Of course! Completely!
-I agree with you. -Right?
We have to change the energy here.
Everybody, let's…
I know!
The fire was a sign.
Sorry, Betina, but the fire is a sign
that the Naked Amoeba should parade like in the past.
With samba and marchinha.
With instruments and singing, nothing else.
Yeah, that sure looks like the Amoeba. An old-fashioned Carnival.
I don't know what I was thinking, trying something new.
It's fine, honey.
Listen, I know everyone's a bit shaken with all that just happened,
but Vicenza is right.
This will make us party like back in the day!
You.
Call every percussion student we have.
I got it. The teachers, too, right?
Call everybody. Yeah.
We're going to parade in the streets like in the old days!
Rejoice, everybody!
Hooray for the Naked Amoeba!
-Hooray! -Hooray!
It's going to be fantastic!
You bet.
Just like you.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Arthur. Thank you.
Mother Moon.
Mother Moon.
But you can call me
Moon.
When we get to New York, Village News will interview you.
Folha will want to talk to you, but it can be through e-mail or text.
At night, there's no other way…
Let's go to Disneyland!
-Yay. -Yay.
-Good morning, Giovanne. -Good morning.
Take care of the kids, please.
Leave it to me.
Yay!
Hey, everybody! Attention, please!
I just talked to Ivete, and it's confirmed now!
She's really not coming!
But I'm here! Let's party, people! Come on!
-I lost my shoe! -For the love of God, Guilherme!
Where's your shoe?
-Here, Betina. -Oh, thank you.
I think there's something wrong with the speaker. Can you check?
Of course. We'll fix it. Thanks.
Vicenza!
No way!
What are you doing here?
I couldn't miss your first Carnival.
-What about the exhibit? -I'll do it later.
How wonderful! I thought you'd never want to see me again.
Nah, that's how families are.
Families fight, argue, but we make up.
Vicenza!
Did you forgive me too?
Of course.
What about Disneyland?
Well, it appears
they both hate Disney and love you.
It doesn't make sense to go anywhere without you.
You guys,
I love you both.
So much.
But I had to find out which one of you is my real dad.
So I had a DNA test, and now I know.
Can you close your eyes for a bit?
Because I have to do something. It's important.
Okay.
Please.
Wow, my heart is racing like crazy.
Yeah, mine too.
Close your eyes.
Are you trying to kill us with the suspense?
Calm down. You both will like it.
Paco, you can't peek.
What's this?
Stay still. There.
When I say go,
both of you open your eyes at the same time
and read the note on the other's forehead. Okay?
and read the note on the other's forehead. Okay? All right.
Three,
two,
one, go!
"Do you want to be Vicenza's father?"
-What? I don't get it. -Yeah, me neither.
Neither of you is my dad.
Sorry, I don't follow.
Guys, that's a good thing for me.
The relationship I have with you is much stronger than any blood ties.
A real father wants to be with his kid.
Look where you are, on such an important day for you both.
What I want to have with you…
is real.
I love you, Dad.
I love you, Dad.
Do you want to be my dad?
Do you want to be my dad?
Do you accept being my dads?
I already see myself as your dad.
It'll be an honor.
So cute, you three together!
-Mom! -What's going on?
-Raion! -Hi, Paco.
Hi, Giovanne.
Hi, Raion. Weren't you in India?
Yeah.
I came back to talk to this girl, who won't keep still.
Honey.
Here. Everything you've always wanted to know.
The name, the address, and the phone number of your father.
He never wanted to hear from you,
but I can no longer keep you from knowing him.
I already have a dad.
Two dads.
Vi! Hey, everybody. We are about to parade. Let's go.
Let's go.
Come on!
Everything is homemade.
-Hey, honey! -Here.
It's beautiful.
It looks great.
You are really special.
Brigadeiro made of banana biomass and 79% cocoa.
But I swear it's delicious. Paco?
No, thanks.
Wow, honey.
It looks pretty.
Paco, Giovanne.
What are you doing?
You two are impossible. Come, Cadu.
-Where are you going? -Yeah, where?
-I can come too if you need me to. -Me too.
Yeah.
Vicenza Shakti Pravananda Oxalá Sarahara Zalala
da Silva Benizatto Costa.
-Better respect your father. -Fathers!
Yes, fathers. Your fathers.
On our trip to the ranch next week, everyone will walk together.
-That's right. -The boys, you two, Paco.
Like an excursion. My trip, my rules.
Oh God. You can go.
I'll take care of these clowns. Let them date.
Date? Why would they date? What do you mean, date?
I don't think Vicenza is old enough to date.
-Obviously not. You're right. -Hey, I'm 18 years old!
That's just what I mean!
Listen, put on a coat because it's getting colder.
A hoodie! A beanie too!
Yeah, and a scarf, a shawl, something around your neck!
-Around the neck, yeah. -Cadu is kinda shady.
-Clearly a psychopath. -Oh, stop it.
He doesn't cut his nails.
He doesn't cut his nails because he plays guitar.
You're both so silly, guys! Let the girl be happy!
Look at this, what a beautiful painting.
You have the best daughter in the world.
-He's got hairy legs. -Oh no.
A grown man. He's not right for her.
Musician. He's really not right for her. He's an artist.
What's wrong with that? I'm an artist too.
Exactly.
"Exactly" what?
What do all these people have in common?
They're all in search of a beautiful love story.
I'm the opposite.
Instead of looking for love, I'm running away from it.
And to avoid mishaps, I came up with three basic rules.
-How much? -Two reais.
The main rule: never lie.
I make my intentions very clear.
I think I have…
Sorry, man…
Rule two: no hanging out…
Hey, man.
…no sleepovers, no trips, no inviting her over.
Forget it. Not happening.
Rule three: never let a relationship last longer than three months.
That's when things get passionate.
SUELLEN GLÓRIA ADDED YOU
And never ever let it get to six months. That's when you fall in love.
Trust me, these rules are foolproof.
I've studied a lot to be a professional bachelor.
-Yeah? -Are you coming?
I'm on my way.
Turn on the camera, let me see.
Do you think you're my husband? You're my lover.
I'll be there soon.
See you.
Be quick, I'm going to work.
Lina, don't forget our cocktail party tomorrow, okay?
I'll need you to be the perfect wife.
Darling, I'm the best.
Goodbye, love.
My wife!
Having lunch with your mistress, Pedro!
No, I was forced to come here!
That's true.
-Don't you talk… -I seduced Pedro!
-Yes! -Don't you talk to me, girl.
That's true.
You're a great cook.
Are those your siblings?
No. My daughter and my husband.
Your husband?
-I didn't want to be here. It's her fault. -I got him drunk!
I hate lies.
You know I never lied to you, Soraya.
I never have a relationship for more than three months.
And our three months end tomorrow.
-No! -I'll kill you!
Love is beautiful? No.
LOVE PHASES - 1 - DESIRE 2 - PASSION - 3 - LOVE Love is a chemical revolution.

It's not for me.
What the… Ouch!
Good morning, Mom!
-You scared me! Stop it, Luiz. -You're so beautiful!
"Beautiful…" Don't you mean "good afternoon"?
You know, I saw on the news today
that the usual
and healthy lifestyle for 13-year-old kids these days
is to open a channel on the Internet and move on.
They leave home to go live in their computers.
I don't know what's wrong with you.
What are you still doing in my house, son?
Mom, I'll never leave you like Dad did. I'll stay to take care of you.
Take care of me? You can barely take care of yourself.
I'm really busy today. CHATAPP MI - JULIA - BIA
Busy? You have no responsibilities, nothing to do.
Honestly, Luiz, you're shameless, inert, unemployed.
I won't be here forever, do you hear me?
Stop. Don't start with that.
You're here now, about to turn 68.
-You're beautiful, in shape. -No…
You look like my sister.
Whose birthday's coming up? Who's having a party?
-I don't want a party. -Okay.
Let's do something else?
Let's go to the beach, sit at the bar.
-Eat fish and fries. -I don't want to.
-Do you like potato? -I do.
-Do you like potato better than the beach? -Stop it, Luiz!
I was born in Rio, I've seen plenty of beaches.
I have to go.
I'm begging you, Luiz, find yourself a wife.
No! No wife!
We've been through this!
Then find a job.
I won't be here forever, Luiz.
Love you, Mom.
Jeez, Maria Inez! I won't answer it.
What a bore!
She calls me all the time. I will not answer it.
Damn it. What?
She gave up?
Maria Inez?
Listen, I told your brother that I don't want a party. What?
I HAVE MYSELF, YOU HAVE… AND WE HAVE ONE ANOTHER.
Hey, Júlio!
I… I'll be there in a few minutes.
It won't take long. There's a tunnel and I'll lose…
So, you're honest with her,
and she throws an apple at you?
Gosh.
People are so clingy these days, you know?
I…
I just want to have fun.
Studies show that single people live longer than married people.
And happier too.
That makes sense.
So,
here's to being single.
-Where have you been? -I can't speak.
-What? -I had an accident.
-You'll ruin everything. -We'll figure it out.
-What's with your hair? -It's a new style.
-Júlio! Good night. -Good night.
What a beautiful wife! What's your name?
It's Lina.
I really like your wife, Júlio. Such a smart woman.
You think? She's a little quiet and shy today.
That's what a smart woman does. She pleases her husband with her silence.
I can tell you're the boss in your family. I like that.
Cool.
I'm bringing you into our scheme.
Let's have lunch tomorrow.
-Of course. -Nice.
JULIO ABREU (LOVER) EX-JULIO

Have you heard? Ms. Ivone is dating a young guy.
He's young enough to be her son.
What's the big deal, Maria Inez?
It's hard to talk to Maria Eugênia, nothing's a big deal.
Is talking trash about people a real conversation?
What should I talk about? My life?
Do you want me to gossip about myself? I'm not stupid.
-I think… -See? Maria Clara agrees.
She doesn't. She's not square, her daughter is a lesbian.
-What? -Yes.
-I'm not square! -You're not?
For God's sake!
Can't you be quiet for a change?
Stop, Maria Inez!
My God! This is our dessert.
-My favorite chef. -It's just a hobby, Mom.
-It's not a hobby. -His entire life is a hobby.
Luiz!
Oh no! Shrimp?
I'm allergic to shrimp.
I know.
He made shrimp, Mom. He knows I'm allergic to it.
What am I going to eat? Rice and farofa?
Make an egg for Maria Inez.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom, look here. Come on!
-Make a wish, Mom. -Go ahead, Grandma.
Mom, what do you want the most in life?
Mom!
Mom!
-Mom! -Mom.
Mom!
It'll be all right.
-What if Mom dies? -It'll be all right.
There she is.
What's wrong, Mom? Tell us.
-What's wrong? -Tell us.
-Dr. Edmar had his suspicions. -Mom!
-But we needed some tests to confirm. -Right. And?
Tell us, Mom. I've got six months to live.
-What? -Come again!
Where is it written here?
You never said anything, now you come up with this?
For God's sake, be quiet!
Mom, you can't die. Okay?
Why can't I die?
Everybody can but me?
I don't want you to leave us, Mom!
But I am, Maria Inez. I'm already gone.
Please, Mom. You can't leave me alone.
I really can't. God, my boy can't do anything.
Yeah, I can't do anything.
I have a last wish for you.
I'll do anything.
-Then I'll go in peace on my next journey. -Don't say that, Mom!
I hope there's one.
My wish, son,
is for you
to find a wife.
We've been through this, Mom. You know me.
It doesn't pan out for me. You know me.
Please. If you die, I'll die too, Mom.
-That works for me. -Why?
-Because I'm cutting you out of my will. -Take it easy, Mom.
What? Why are you doing this now?
Are you punishing me?
Unlike your sisters, you won't have kids to inherit my assets.
So, you're out of my will.
All right.
If that's your last wish,
I'll do it.
I'll get married.
-What? -Shut up, Maria Inez! Okay?
My baby boy.
I'm so happy, baby.
I think it's time.
I've met a girl and we… I just think it's too soon!
He's lying, Mom! He's bluffing!
-Don't pick on your brother. -God!
-He can make mistakes, but he's no liar. -It's true.
You'll get to meet her.
Who? What's her name?
He doesn't even know her name!
I don't wanna say.
Please, respect him! That's how he processes things.
He'll introduce her to us at the right moment.
-Mom! -Won't you, my love? My God.
Come here, Maria Inez.
Hello?
Helô, hi. Long time no see.
Hi, stranger.
Hey, Ilana. It's Luiz.
You deleted my number? Luiz.
Hi, Isa. I need a big favor.
No, I understand. Okay.
So, I was the problem.
All right.
I need to see you.
I have a special request.
I want you to marry me.
It's not just about the sex, or a physical thing.
Don't get me wrong, you're very attractive.
But I know you deeply.
And, deep down, you're not bad.
Maybe better than on the surface.
Are you trying to marry me or scare me off?
I'm giving you the chance of a better, happier life.
A lot of people live a pretend life.
They need to think we're a couple. We'll keep our lovers…
-What? -Of course.
Who do you think I am?
You're Nestor, my best friend!
The thing is that's my rustic little hand already has a ring on it.
Nestor, this is a win-win.
I think you need a girl, dude.
I need a brother
who will get me out of this situation.
I need you.
I can pay you.
-Nice. -Nice?
-Nice! -Of course, man! Give me a kiss.
-Get off me. Are you crazy? -You're my man!
-I knew I could count on you. -Do you remember Júlio Abreu?
-Júlio Abreu… -Yes.
-The journalist? -Yeah.
-His latest story is on fire. -On fire!
-You know he's gay, right? -Right.
He hired a fake wife
to get into the conservative guys' scheme. Look.
JOURNALIST UNCOVERS SCHEME
She's hot, man.
-Is she an actress? -What?
A stage actress. He said she was great.
The kind of girl you bring home on holidays to meet the family.
-Get her number with Júlio. I'll call her. -Trust me, bro.
Cave painting.
Cave painting.
The first kissing scene ever recorded in the world.
And you thought it was in Hollywood, right?
This isn't going to work, Nestor.
I don't lie to women, how will I lie to my mom?
-You don't lie to your dates. -No.
Mom is not a date. Try again.
You have a point.
It was our first step beyond experiencing love.
We started to mimic love.
Getting to romantic comedies was just a matter of time.
And technology too.
Lina! Nice, but we're leaving.
-Thanks. -Let's go.
Be cool, just chat her up.
"I need your services."
"Services."
UNKNOWN CALLER
-Hi, Ms. Lina. -Look at this, Isaías.
-They called ten times. -That's a lot.
"Your data plan has expired."
They just want to rub it in.
Of course I know it's expired.
What a loser.
The bills beat us up, then come back for our dignity.
What are we having for lunch?
We have beef, but our fish dishes are a hit.
Are they?
SPECIAL! TEN REAIS! TODAY
I'll have that salami.
Half serving. Artist's special.
Answer it, Ms. Lina. It could be good news.
UNKNOWN CALLER
Pick it up, girl.
Hello?
Who is it? I can barely hear you.
Depending on who this is, I hear even less.
-Hello? -Hi. Is Lina there?
It's about a job.
A job? Just a moment…
-Work, man? -Lina, darling! It's a call for you.
Thank you, Grandma…
Salamita.
This is Lina Maia. How can I help you?
Hi.
I need to hire a wife.
You're talking with the best.
Let me check my schedule, okay?
Hold on.
Today is your lucky day, my friend.
My movie has just been released. I have an opening.
It's more like a chasm.
My place in two hours?
Write down the address.
Luiz?
-What's up? -Lina Maia, actress.
Cool. May I?
I'm sorry. Don't mind me.
It's my character development process.
I do some stretching, some warm-ups, act as if I were on stage.
Sit down, please.
So, let's talk.
What kind of couple do you need?
Just a regular couple,
mature people.
A couple like that doesn't sell well.
Messy couples look real.
But I'm a centered man.
I'm pretty peaceful, but I have no experience.
I'm a pro. I've been married five times.
I also played animals.
If you want something more like Nala and Simba…
-Nala and Simba? -I can do that.
Right, follow me.
How to create a love story?
How did we meet? In detail.
I bought you a drink at a club. We spent the night together.
Luiz, I want romance.
A carnival.
Do you even go?
We met at your friend's house and talked about a movie.
Fight Club.
Fight Club.
Best sex we've had?
Hold on. My mom won't ask about that.
There's always an uncle asking about your sex life.
-DTR? -I'm an easygoing guy, you know?
Pretty cool.
One's coolness can trigger another's rage.
Let's rehearse.
These are the lines. You start it off, and then we take turns.
You, me, you, me…
"You lied to me."
Let's try again, a little more natural.
Loosen up. Pretend you're not reading it.
All right. Go.
No.
"You lied to me?"
It was for your own good.
-"Forgive me." -No, that one is mine.
-Right. -Remember when I said…
"I was deceived for my own good?"
-What the hell? -It's an exercise. Let's go.
Have a nice life.
-That one was dope, right? -Let's…
Sure. Let's repeat it a lot.
The body speaks.
Hands towards the sky make people trust you.
It's a primitive message that says you're unarmed.
Does it work?
A TV host does that for years, and it works.
But he also throws airplane-shaped money to people.
I'm coming!
Fill in this form, please.
You either vacate my place or pay the late rent.
Urgently!
My situation is urgent.
I'm in the ICU of debt. Do you understand, Ms. Hortênsia?
I'm slowly dying in the ICU of debt!
Your eviction notice expires in 15 days.
Fifteen days!
-There. -All right, let's make this work.
One color.
I don't know. You ask too many questions.
Can we speed this up?
I need five dates in six months.
The most important is the annual Pereira family reunion. Can we do that?
-Six months. Deal. -Great.
-I'll be the perfect wife. -Great.
I can be whoever you want.
-Mom would like her to be a lawyer. -Yes, Your Honor.
A tennis player.
Your dad owns a farm, your mom, a sugar plant. Bilingual.
-Oui! -Okay?
And remember, you're a Catholic.
-Amen. -You don't drink alcohol.
Juice, please.
-What the hell are you wearing? -Good afternoon.
-Criticizing your fiancée's outfit, love? -Isn't it too much?
-Says who? The Sexist Fashion Week? -Quiet!
-It won't work. -It will.
Let's get to work. Listen.
A couple's privacy is sacred.
If you're in trouble, just say "kiss".
-And we'll talk in private. -Okay.
Or lean over to kiss me and whisper in my ear.
-The kiss is fake. This way? -Yes.
You have to pay him.
Wait here! How much was it?
-I like this girl already! -Nice to meet you. Lina.
-It's so nice to meet you. -Thanks.
-Beautiful house. -Thanks.
Get us a drink, Luiz. A liqueur, maybe.
Lina doesn't drink alcohol, Mom.
Yes, but I'll make an exception today.
Great!
Tell me. What do you do for a living?
I'm a doctor.
-A doctor? -Here, Mom.
That's awesome. She's a doctor.
Has Luiz told you about my health condition?
I want your opinion.
-What are you doing? Mom's dying. -How did you not tell me that?
It's hard. I can't open up about it yet.
-My character needed to know that. -Why you…
Here.
Please, give me your honest opinion.
This is the scan.
I want you to…
-It's upside down. -What?
Please, be honest with me.
What do you think?
I think it's so sad.
My three Marias are here!
Come here.
I want to kiss you.
-And kiss you good. -Be serious.
You were supposed to be a lawyer.
It'll be fine.
Lawyer, doctor, they all have a diploma.
Listen to me. You'll ruin everything.
-For God's sake, this has to work. -It will, trust me.
The lovebirds want privacy.
I brought you a chocolate cake.
-I don't like chocolate cake. -I know.
That's because he used to eat dirt as a child. Idiot!
Idiot.
Girls.
-Look at him. -The house special.
-He does that. -My favorite dish.
-He always rocks! -It looks delicious!
-That was the first thing he said to me. -He's such a great cook.
-He is, isn't he? -You'll never have to cook again.
So, where did you two meet?
-At the carnival. -At Nestor's.
-What? -Well…
We were at Nestor's.
It was his son's birthday, and we went to the carnival.
-Yes. -Right?
-Luiz and I were a match right away. -That's right.
-Really? -Yes.
We're together because we like fights. Isn't it crazy?
We like the same movie.
-Rocky… Club. -Fight Club.
Lina knows all the fighting movies. She likes them all.
Stop, don't expose me. But, yes, I love them.
They're all about virile men, and the fighting.
I like that. I like men a lot.
What did you say?
No. I'm talking about martial arts, honey.
That was awkward.
-Talking about men like that? -Luiz!
-Gosh! Are you jealous now? -It's not that.
It came out wrong.
-It came out terribly. -Says the TED Talk badass.
-Whose ass? -Google it!
-No, never mind. -Listen, honey.
Don't worry about that. What matters is that you're here.
Let's set the wedding date as soon as possible.
I'd be so happy.
That'd be great, baby.
-That's all we want, right? -Sure.
You can't get married in a leap year.
Is this a leap year?
-You can't get married in a leap year. -Right?
It's bad luck.
We're actually aiming for January 4th.
In the church, by the book.
Lina is a devout Catholic.
-Lovely. -She's worth her weight in gold.
Speaking of gold, you know he doesn't work, right?
For me, that's perfect.
I spend so much time at the hospital. So, having him at home is perfect.
That's right. I work on different things,
like self-awareness. You should try that sometime.
The Oracle of Delphi once said, "Know thyself."
Did he say, "Provide for thyself," by chance?
-Listen. -Do you want to take a picture?
-No. -Let's do it.
I'd like your phone number.
I'll add you to the family group chat.
It's such an honor.
I like Luiz's idea, let's take a picture.
-Good idea. -Great.
-I can't see myself. -Cheers!
Hold on, Maria Eugênia!
I'll have another piece of cake.
Samir is here. Goodbye, everyone.
Good luck to the couple. You'll need it.
And I'm going to take my baby for a ride.
-I'll go get the car keys. -Okay.
-Tell me, Lina. What's your specialty? -Yes.
-"Blatriatics." -Sorry?
Pediatrics?
-Wow! Can I ask you something? -That's cool!
Going to your fiancée's house?
No, we're going out.
-Move over, Samir. -What's wrong?
-Move! -What happened? Calm down.
Ouch, my hemorrhoids! Wait, what happened?
They're so happy about this engagement.
Big deal! I got married first.
-It's so unfair. -I was the baby.
Dad used to say, "Dance for the guests, Inezinha."
Then this creep shows up.
-It was lovely to meet you. -Thank you.
-Your family is amazing. -Thank you.
-Nice house. -You're always welcome here.
-Let's go. Thanks, Mom. -What a beautiful couple.
-Take a piece of cake. -She's on a diet. Bye.
It was all about him. "Luiz can say 'Mommy'."
-I said it before him. -And way better than him, I'm sure.
"Those are his first steps." I thought,
"If that creep can walk, I'm going to do somersaults."
I bet you were great.
I did gymnastics and athleticism. What did I get?
-A gold medal? -A missing tooth.
That rehearsal was a waste of time.
"No, Luiz, let's do this, let's do that."
You did everything wrong.
-You messed it up. -I didn't mess up.
-Didn't you? -I was improvising. I'm an actress.
Yes, you're a lame actress. That's what you are.
He who laughs last, laughs best.
He'll give himself away eventually.
Do you think I'll let him do that?
I'll expose him myself.
I won't go anywhere with you.
I'm surely taking you home. I'm seeing Suellen Glória tonight.
-Who's stopping you? -I rescheduled to rehearse with you.
A waste of time.
You called me lame. You've never even seen my work.
-Of course you're going home. -"Lame."
Hey, Luiz!
Your sister wants to celebrate with you.
Double date!
I can't take you home.
SUELLEN GLÓRIA ACCEPT
I can't stand her up. Please, help me.
-Me? -Please.
-My shift is over. -I'll pay you double.
I'll have champagne.
Suellen Glória is at that bar.
I need you to cover for me, so I can be at both.
Okay.
Who would've thought we'd ever see Luiz in love?
I never saw that coming.
-You must be a very special girl. -Come on.
-Thanks. -I agree.
-We deserve champagne. -Sure! Special occasion.
-Thanks. -I'll have this one. Le… Lecle…
-Lecleique. -Leclerc.
-That one, the most expensive. -I'll have one too.
Excuse me. I think I left the car lights on.
-Samir can go with you. -Sure.
I turned them off.
-Thanks. -Don't mention it.
Don't you have an important call to make?
-It just came to me. -Yes, I do.
-I'll go somewhere quieter. -Okay.
I'm coming too. I have to call our son.
You know what?
-I can make the call later. -Yes.
Let's have champagne.
-I'll call them later. -Stay here with us.
Are you keeping a secret, Luiz? You look nervous.
No, I'm cool. I have nothing to hide.
SUELLEN GLÓRIA ACCEPT
Tell us the hot details of your relationship.
I'm a modern woman.
I can't. I'm too shy.
Give me a kiss, honey. I want a kiss.
Watch the performance
of this lame actress here.
Cool.
Maria Inez, Luiz is really keeping a secret.
-He is? -But it's not from you. It's from me.
You lied to me!
Come again.
You lied to me!
It was for your own good.
I was deceived for my own good?
Keep it down. Everybody is looking.
Forgive me.
What?
Forgive me.
Have a nice life.
-I'll go after her. -We will too.
-Samir, finish that fish. -No.
Eat your fish.
I'll deal with that later.
-Suellen Glória? -Yes?
I'm Maria Inez. Luiz's sister.
Is he all right?
He has appendicitis.
He wouldn't let go of his phone… Excuse me.
He kept yelling, "I have a date with Suellen Glória!"
He said you'd be here.
Hold on. So, he was sedated…
-Champagne, please. -Sure.
Thank you.
And I decided to come tell you in person.
Thank you so much.
-Don't mention it. -How thoughtful.
-No, I mean it. -It was nothing.
Mom is very religious.
She's always picking on my husband, Samir.
Waiter!
You don't drink, do you?
-I don't. -I respect that. It's sophisticated.
Well, I'm not sophisticated, so…
I'll have just one more. Waiter.
Suellen Glória hopes you get well soon.
She's sweet. I'll charge extra, she talks too much.
An extra? You can forget about it.
I won't give you any more money.
See you.
Good morning, Mommy!
-My queen. -Gosh! Look at that!
The engagement is doing you good.
You got up early.
I was tired. I needed to rest, you know?
I'm spending the day with you, my queen.
I don't want sad faces. I'm happy you're getting married.
-So am I. -And so am I.
What is she doing here?
Surprise, honey! I came for breakfast.
Dinosaurs, that's cute.
I invited her to have breakfast with us.
I have an engagement gift for you.
My dear mother-in-law, you shouldn't…
You shouldn't have come.
I'm being polite. And I can't afford to decline a gift or extra work.
I'm not paying extra. I didn't invite you here.
She's coming. And you'll pay every penny of my overtime.
-What's this, Mom? -Open it.
-What key is this? -That key is to our family condo
-that I want you two to have. -I can't accept…
Ms. Carlota, thank you so much!
I appreciate it so much. I mean, we appreciate it as a couple.
And so will Carlotinha, our first daughter.
-She'll take her granny's name. -Oh my God!
Thank you so much, Mom.
-Can I call you "Mom"? -Of course, honey.
Group hug!
Your sister's nosy. Living together makes it easier to hide things from her.
I heard you say you were being evicted.
I'm not stupid. You're taking advantage of this.
What's wrong with that? I'm here on business.
No.
I hired a five-date pack, not a full-time wife.
We need to discuss the wage for my 24/7 shift,
no days off, plus night pay for sleeping at work.
Have you been drinking?
Do you think I want all this?
-Looks good, right? -It's darker there.
When it dries… Have you ever painted a wall?
So, it's not done.
But we agreed on one part-time wife, right?
Excuse me. We're done.
Great! Come here, please.
Part-time marriage sounds good, huh?
6 MONTHS FARCE ENDS - DECEMBER 20
6 MONTHS FARCE ENDS - DECEMBER 20 Open house! MONDAY, JUNE 4
Start looking for a place to live,
because all of this will be over in five months and 21 days.
You're really counting.
That's how long my mom has to live.
At the beginning, I thought Mom's illness…
I didn't want to face it.
Humanity is always three drinks behind reality,
said Humphrey Bogart.
-Who's that? -What?
You don't know?
-Are you judging me? -No, I'm not.
Let's send her a picture. Come.
-Now? No fingers. -No, go ahead.
-This is the right pose for her. -Here we go.
Luiz and Lina in our group chat.
They look adorable!
Your BP is lower.
Really? It's lower, that's great.
Hand me my phone, Maria Inez.
What
a beautiful
couple!
A three-part message.
-What a cute little mommy! -That's my mom.
Let's do the couple's paint war. It's a classic, never gets old.
Is that our family's condo?
I gave it to them.
Oh!
-I'm going to pass out. -What's wrong, Maria Inez?
-Take it easy. -Help me, Dr. Edmar.
-Don't be dramatic. -Relax.
-Let's send her a nude? -People believe accidental nudes.
-I'll send it, wait, then delete it. -Exactly.
They're sending naughty pictures in our group.
What?
They're sending nudes?
They deleted it.
-You look better. -She really does.
A lot better.
What a gorgeous view.
Enjoy it. This gig won't last forever.
It's the time I need to see if I'm staying in São Paulo.
How did you start with this…
-Wife for hire? -You read my thoughts.
It took you long enough to ask me about that.
Yeah, I never asked.
I had bills to pay.
What other characters have you played?
All sorts of animals and plants in children's plays.
Right, for kids.
I've also been a daughter, sister, lover.
Why would anyone hire a fake lover?
Listen up.
-The guy was busted. -Right.
So, I pretended to be his lover and apologized to his wife.
She punched me in the jaw. It still hurts.
-Really? -Feel it.
-Get out! -Mission accomplished.
-You're good at this. -You're better.
You have money and no job. I can barely get by.
How about education? Did you go to college?
-I did. -Did you?
I was promising.
A promise that was never fulfilled, but I was promising.
So, another toast. That makes the two of us.
-Two failed promises. -That's me.
But my monologue is coming up.
And the countdown starts.
If nothing works out, I'll gather my stuff, which is not much,
go back home and end my acting career.
Where are you from?
Far away.
Norway? Are you from Norway?
Norway, really?
Come over here.
You're sleeping on the floor, the sofa is worse.
-Sleep over here. -No, stop it.
I never spend the night with women. I'm following the rules.
I'm not complaining. I'm fine here.
This is my spot, okay?
Are you awake?
Lina?
What the hell?
SAT 30 - JUNE
Heterosexual love stories
have an impenetrable barrier.
Men.
-Good morning. -Men.
-An impenetrable… -Mom is coming over.
She wants to see if you're taking care of her son.
An impenetrable barrier. Men.
She brought these cleaning products,
so you can do the housework.
You do the housework. Or hire someone.
I've never done that, I won't start now.
I hired you. I pay you with my allowance, you clean up.
I was hired as an actress, and in terrible working conditions.
This house is a mess, there's no coffee, no catering.
You're a lame actress.
-Heterosexual love stories… -Lame actress!
I hired you as a wife.
Do you know which organ works solely to give pleasure?
No, I don't know.
I'm not talking to you, I'm rehearsing.
Of course you don't. It's the clitoris.
What does that mean?
That I have better things to do than cleaning up Luiz Pereira's house.
Luis Pereira…
I'll clean here.
It's really dirty in here.
WED 14 - JULY
Mom will come over tomorrow.
Okay.
WED 8 - AUGUST I missed a call from your mom.
She texted me saying she can't make it.
-Again? -Yes.
WED 30 - AUGUST
What's up?
Wow!
Since Mom didn't come… Want some?
Of course!
It's much better.
Mom learned to make video calls.
She seems happy.
I think she'll die peacefully.
Since she's not here, and my sister isn't bugging me,
what did Luiz do? He invited himself to visit Suellen Glória.
Cool. So, you're not coming to my monologue opening night.
Tonight.
Gosh…
-I can't stand her up again. -Right. Don't worry.
-I haven't had sex for two months. -It's your loss.
It's not my loss. Look.
-I don't like all that yelling. -Actors don't yell.
We project our voices.
Screw you!
Projected. Not yelled.
Hello?
-Hey, baby. -Hi.
I can't believe this.
Let me call you back.
Perhaps the secret ingredient
of the best love stories…
is two big servings of solitude.
I have myself,
you have yourself,
and we have one another.
Hey. Let me get this straight.
Maria Inez was spying on you with binoculars.
-And drinking soda? -I'm not crazy.
-Please, Luiz! -Don't you have anything to tell me?
-Like what? -You're acting weird.
-I'm not acting weird. -Yes, you are.
I'm not.
-Is it 'cause I didn't go to your opening? -I was mad, but not anymore.
I see.
Grapes are fruit.
And doctors recommend one glass before dinner.
Well, I drink one week's worth in a day.
-Please, split the charge in two cards. -What?
Did you bang your head? How about my benefits?
-Transportation, meal voucher… -Vacation!
As domestic workers,
we're entitled to benefits like any other worker.
That's right, comrade!
I'm tired of cleaning, and ironing, and cooking.
I'm freaking sick of it!
Heard that? I don't even have my wallet.
-It's like I paid her to say that to you. -That was ridiculous.
-But the shoe fit. It did! -She was yelling.
"The shoe fit…"
Funny is that I am the homemaker. You just sit around all day.
That's true.
I have to admit, that's true.
But I'll redeem myself by taking you out to lunch. My treat!
Oh my.
-You have to relax. -Sure, because things are going so well.
Blackmailed by my mom, stalked by my sister,
exploited by my fake wife. I really should relax.
I meant romantically, like having someone for casual sex,
a hookup.
A hookup?
Really? Look who's telling me that.
You have no one. Give me a break.
-Priorities, hon. -Come on!
I'm in a creative process phase, I can't waste my energy on sex.
My pal Honoré de Balzac, writer, never had sex while writing a book.
Man, don't even bring that up.
Why don't you invite Suellen over?
Rule number two, never invite a woman over.
Fine. You can have sex next year.
That's too far away. I can't wait until next year.
-You think? -Yeah.
I'll go to a friend's house to give you privacy.
What friend?
-I've never seen you with a friend. -I have plenty of friends.
Sure you do. They live in library shelves,
and were born in the 1800's.
That's funny.
-That's a joke. I see. -Yeah.
Why don't you mind your own messed-up life?
Fine, Suellen Glória may come over. But…
you have to be there.
What if my sister shows up?
I'll have to pretend I'm Maria Inez.
But I'd be lying to Suellen Glória.
It's perfect!
You're so sweet! It was nice of you to bring this…
this… this bush.
It's actually a tree of happiness.
I planted male and female seeds.
They represent your love and bond.
Luiz, if you don't marry Suellen, who is glorious,
then I will!
Didn't you say you're married when we met?
He's gone.
Samir is gone.
He left so much debt behind, you could say he is dead.
But he isn't, he just left.
Luiz took me in.
-I'm sorry I brought this up. -Don't worry.
I'm going to have fun tonight!
Luiz is our super chef.
Yeah. You can get married now.
I should tell you.
I don't usually keep a relationship…
With whoever crosses his path. He's picky.
But I can assure you that Luiz is a keeper.
Maria Inez!
Can you help me? Please.
-I can help. -Leave it to Maria Inez.
Leave it to me, dear.
Darling girl.
There's a nice bed in there for you.
What… Hold on, I…
I really have to go.
No way! You can sleep over.
It's a nice day to have sex, huh? There's the bedroom.
No, I've got to get up early.
I ride my bike in the morning.
You can ride this.
Oops! A road full of speed bumps.
Thanks, but I really should go.
But you're already here.
Bye. Nice seeing you.
We'll have another chance.
How many people are having sex now?
About a million.
I looked it up for my play.
One million orgasms.
Nope. It's 514,000.
Because only 75% of men and 25% of women will reach climax.
The things I learn from you.
You're nuts.
You're totally nuts.
I take this opportunity
to announce to São Paulo…
Step away.
…that Luiz doesn't need to pay me anymore.
Wait, what?
That's all.
-All right! I'm glad to hear it. -I know you are.
In exchange,
you'll cook at an event where I'm going to perform.
-No way. No! -Too late, they're counting on you.
I've already sold our "Better Half Combo."
-It's a bachelorette party. -What?
This is not going to work. I'm not a chef.
If you fake it long enough, you'll become one.
-Remember? -Yes.
Hello.
Chef Luiz Pereira, this is Paula, the bride.
Oi.
Have we met before?
No.
I'd definitely remember you.
Excuse us, Chef. I'll show you where I'll perform.
-Soraya! -Hi.
Let me introduce our chef. The bride's mother…
Where is he? He was right here.
-Never mind. Let's go. -Sure.
Yes…
-What are you doing? -You scared me!
A bunch of my hookups are here.
-What do you mean? -Look.
Catarina, Cecília, and Soraya, who happens to be the bride's mother!
Don't you dare leave this kitchen!
You can always expect some shit after a "but".
-It's true. -Right?
"Yeah, love,
but I'm not like the other guys."
"I have a mother."
"I have a sister." What?
"I listen to women."
As if it were some sort of special skill, right?
That women are…
Women are like ghosts.
They can haunt you all of a sudden.
Women can easily find you,
catch you!
They'll find you behind the curtain!
Hiding away!
Luiz?
Soraya!
I need to check the food, it's going to burn.
Chef, the appetizers are a hit.
Yes, the appetizers.
Let's keep them coming, okay?
That's great.
You nearly…
Wait a minute.
…destroyed my marriage.
You scoundrel! Come over here.
I almost lost my stupid husband because of you!
You son of a…
-Hi! -What?
You should see your faces.
That was great.
Give it up for our actor chef,
and for the bride's mother,
who was the star of our little prank.
Bravo!
She didn't tell me anything. It was great.
It was a surprise, dear.
Featuring our actor, trained in Japan by Professor Ikillyou.
Get lost.
Let's give it up for the bride's mother. She nailed it!
What an actress!
And a round of applause for our chef,
who, sadly, is not on the menu.
Back to the cave painting…
TUE 3 - SEPTEMBER BETTER HALF COMBO - 50TH ANNIVERSARY
THU 5 WEDDING
SAT 7 BAPTISM
WED 11 BACHELOR PARTY
TUE 17 BETTER HALF COMBO - DIVORCE PARTY
I don't believe it.
Your sister isn't here, crazy man.
That's what you think.
She's cunning, that one. Trust me.
You have to go out, have some fun. Forget about your sister.
I spent the money I had left on pots and pans.
Mom has cut off my allowance.
The disease might affect her memory.
-It was me, actually. -You what?
I told her you're earning your own money now.
-Why'd you do that? -You should've seen how happy she was.
I can lend you money. How much?
How would you lend me anything? We make the same wage,
and you spend twice as much. What's left to lend?
I wasn't aware we were married for real.
-Wait. -You should've told me.
Relax.
Unbelievable.
I'm taking you to a sister-free party tonight.
-Party? -Yes, you're paranoid.
Maria Inez! Over there.
Hello!
This party is for actors.
With these masks on, we can flirt with everyone.
We? What about your abstinence?
My monologue is ready, baby. It's time to get some action.
Let's hit the bar.
I'll find someone to kiss right now.
They put a ladder in the middle of the catwalk.
Can you imagine that? How could I climb it in those heels?
I pretended it was part…
of the choreography.
-I don't get in trouble. -What? That's all you ever talk about.
I don't get in trouble because I don't wait for it to happen.
-But you build up a situation. -No, that's the thing.
-I don't cause trouble, I run from it. -You're the trouble.
-I can't tell you… -I go…
Unlike other guys, I never lie to women.
-I'm different, that's all. -Don't confuse your flaws with the truth.
-Said my girl Clarice Lispector. -What is my flaw?
Not wanting to fall in love
just to walk out on my family like my father did? Is that a flaw?
-Can I be honest? -Please.
The more you deny it, the more you become like him.
Get out of here!
It's settled. Passion won't rule my life.
-Love is what leads everybody's lives. -Not mine.
Whether finding it or running from it, it's always about love.
Not mine.
We met three months ago.
-Already? -You know what that means?
No?
We'd be in the passion phase.
-The second phase of love. -Yeah.
-"My darling." -Baby talk.
-"You're my baby." -"My baby."
-"You're the love of my life." -"Cute."
-"You're so cute." -"My sweetie."
-Pathetic! -Ridiculous!
Mom has only three months to live.
Her time is almost up.
So is ours.
Thank goodness!
Not because she'll die,
but because we'll finally be free.
-We'll go our separate ways. -Yeah!
-It's been three months already. -Yeah.
-I can't wait. -We'll be free.
I'm happy to have met you.
So am I.
I'm going to bed. I'm exhausted.
I'll stay a little longer.
I'm having lunch with my mom tomorrow.
I think she's been avoiding me.
You'll see a different woman from what she used to be.
Good night.
Mom?
Mom!
Mom!
I dozed off, son.
I missed you so much, my love.
Let me take a look at you.
Did you bring me flowers?
Are you all right?
I'm great!
Let's get some lunch. I'm starving.
I have to say, since you left home,
I've never touched that stove again.
But you loved cooking.
I hated cooking. Always have.
I still don't know who you got that from.
But I'm so proud of you for becoming a chef.
Let's eat.
Are we eating from the box?
They're biodegradable. Throwing them away makes trees sprout.
-My friend from yoga told me. -Friend from yoga?
She's in the GeriaTrip, our vibrant group of senior girls.
We hop on a van and go everywhere.
You know, son,
death
can teach you a lot about life.
Dr. Edmar told me that.
I can see that.
Poor man. He's a widower, so lonely.
We invited him to our group. He's the only man among us girls.
It's good to have a doctor around.
It's great. He just gave me a ride home on his motorcycle.
Motorcycle?
He said he's pretty sure
I'm going to be here on January 4th.
Mom, that's great news!
I'm so happy!
I'll be here for your wedding!
-It's great. -Yeah.
I broke my rules, man. Every single one of them.
They're falling apart.
-Why are you whispering? -Quiet!
Maria Inez is not here. I'm worried about you.
My mom was about to die, man.
All of a sudden, she comes back from the ashes.
I'm engaged to an actress. Awesome.
I don't get laid in three months. Hey, that's awesome too.
Brother, just grab a girl,
drive up to the hills
and camp over there with her.
-My sister is on my tail. -Relax!
It's too far, she won't even bother.
My mother-in-law hated it.
Fine. Where is it?
It's a two-hour drive. It's beautiful up there, look.
-A tent here, a fire there. -Where's it?
Hey!
-What's up? -What is that? Going camping?
Nestor gave me an idea.
He got me thinking, you know?
I realized I need some time off
to clear my mind.
So, I'm taking a romantic trip to the hills.
Care to come?
On a romantic trip?
Yeah, it does sound a little weird.
But this whole situation with the fake wedding
has been changing my mind.
It made me consider the possibility
of a real relationship.
Yeah…
And I've got Suellen Glória.
She's beautiful, kind, smart.
So, I asked her.
Right, Suellen Glória. And you want me to come along?
You need to. You have to be there.
Maria Inez would suspect us if you stayed.
And Mom would love to see
romantic pictures of us, in the woods, among the trees.
How'll you explain my presence to Suellen Glória?
I'm sorry for separating you two,
but I feel sick in the back seat.
-It's fine. -"Feel sick".
This trip will help you forget the troubles with your husband.
-It'll be great. -I'll get over it.
Awesome.
-Let's see if you guys know this one. -Hit it.
-If you need to build a dam -…to build a dam
-I've got… -I've got a beaver
-If you need to build a dam -If you need to build a dam
-I've got… -I've got the wood
-How do you even know this one? -How do you?
-It's so ridiculous. -It's good.
-It's here, right? -Looks like it.
So, we're here.
Are you sure I'm not the third wheel?
I am. Actually, I feel more comfortable with you here.
I've never taken a girl on a trip.
And now you're taking two. You don't count.
You have to see what's inside.
She's a doctor, she has a Law degree,
tennis state champion, polyglot, doesn't drink alcohol.
What else do you want?
How about inside? Her kidneys, her gallbladder, an ingrained grudge?
You're being silly.
You can't see it, can you?
You've become the romantic type you've always feared.
-I'm not. -You are.
Look at your face.
-You think I'm in love with her? -Let me close it. Move.
Get out of the way.
-In love… -You think so?
Idiot.
-What? -Come here.
-Put this on. -I'm coming.
You too, Maria Inez. There are mosquitoes here. I made it.
You made it?
Yes, it's 100% natural.
She made it.
-Be careful with the vines. -Thanks.
-I'll carry that for you. -Thanks.
Nature is so perfect.
There's a lake too.
Beware of the ants.
But… Oh no.
Be careful around the fire.
Look at that! Good job!
It looks great.
-Cool. -Looks nice, right?
I'm surprised. You nailed it.
Let's get inside.
-It's dark, it's late. -Okay.
We need some rest.
-Let's go. -But now?
-Yeah, now. -We just got here.
Come in.
It's probably just a little hawk. Come here.
-It sounds like a wild pig. -It does, right?
Don't scare me!
-Look! -No!
No…
What's that?
-I'm going outside. -What? No!
Are you crazy?
-Stay in here. -Don't leave me alone.
-I'm so sorry. -No!
I have a good reason. I'm sorry.
-What do you want? -I have a bad feeling about Mom.
-Will you pray with me? -No, get out of here.
-She just lost her husband, Luiz. -I lost my husband.
-Luiz. -I want to make love.
I called you because we need to take pictures for your mom.
Now? When I was about to get laid?
-The night was a mess. -Really?
I hibernated.
Like a bear.
The lake is a nice setting. Hurry up, my battery is almost dead.
I like it here.
God, I can't believe this. They're so weird.
MARIA INEZ ACCEPT
Hi, Maria Inez.
-Lina? -Lina? No, it's Suellen Glória.
Suellen Glória?
Yes. Luiz's girlfriend.
Is this Maria Inez? Luiz's sister?
I am Maria Inez.
And you're being played. We all are.
Looks good, right?
-It was here. -Where are our things?
-What… -Is this the wrong campsite?
No!
The fire was…
-Suellen Glória? -What's that over there?
What does it say?
-Doctor's handwriting. -It's a freaking ECG.
Forget it. We can't read this.
Suellen Glória!
Where's my car?
-My phone is dead. Where's yours? -Damn!
Oh my God!
My phone was in the tent.
I feel butterflies in my stomach.
But if I were in love,
I'd be sad that she's gone.
And I'm not.
Yes, I guess.
I'm not sure.
How come? You've had lots of relationships.
If you don't know, who does?
All my husbands were fake.
But in real life, I've had a few boyfriends.
How do you know so much about relationships?
I learned it from books, movies, plays…
So, you, too, know it in theory only.
What's love like in real life? I mean, in practice.
In practice, love is two "solitudes" that protect and greet each other.
It is cold.
A friend of mine said that. Rainer Maria Rilke.
Don't you have any real friends?
You. Aren't you my friend?
You are.
It is cold.
It's nice that you have a big family.
The bond you all have.
I've always been lonely.
I've been pretty lonely too. I've felt lonely.
Unlike everybody else.
For the first time, I feel like I have a real partner.
Someone like me.
You should let women know you up close.
You're more handsome than from afar.
And from afar, you're… Holy shit!
You're a captivating character.
-We're great together, aren't we? -We are.
The world can't hold us.
-Who said that? -A friend of mine.
-Yeah? -Yeah. Homer.
Homer?
-Homer Simpson. -No.
No, come on.
You're lame.
I'm lame.
-That's my car. -Your car?
What happened here?
JERKS
-It's open. -Our stuff is here.
Here's my phone.
Can you read it?
I think I see an "E".
Here's the key.
I did my best with what you had in the fridge.
What are we having?
-Penne with vegetables. -I'll have two.
-Two what? -Two pennes.
Just kidding, chef.
Two big servings of solitude.
I have myself,
you have yourself, and we have one another.
Wonderful!
She is really wonderful.
Lina, your Better Half Combo is amazing.
Isn't it? The classic finger food,
also known as street food with frills.
Idealized by our just-divorced Ju,
and developed by our chef Luiz Pereira, who's killing it!
You're on fire.
I'm going to change.
DECEMBER
FRI 9 ENGAGEMENT DINNER
WED 14 29TH ANNIVERSARY
TUE 20 ANNUAL PEREIRA FAMILY REUNION
Excuse me. God, my son is here!
-My love. -Mom!
-My babies. -You look stunning!
You look so
full of life.
The doctors are saying
that I'm a curious case, like Benjamin Button.
I keep getting younger. Right, Ed?
I can confirm it's true.
It's really a miracle, isn't it?
I need a drink.
Enjoy it.
-Is it nice, my love? -It's wonderful.
Hey.
Listen. Don't you think Valdete's had plastic surgery?
Her eyes look a little slanted.
-What's the big deal? -See? You killed the conversation again.
-You just talk about people's lives. -Your life must be so…
Yes! Good evening, Pereira family!
This is the moment you have all been waiting for.
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.
Our dance contest!
The dance contest!
They've won this contest for the last 21 years.
Let's give it up for Maria Inez and Samir.
The next couple in our contest is Maria Eugênia and Tonico.
We'll nail it today!
Valdete and Carlos, come up on stage.
Making their debut in our contest,
let's hear it
for Luiz Pereira and Lina!
Let's give it up for our contestants.
Let's begin!
You can't beat me.
I'm Madonna. You don't have what it takes.
Shut up. I'm a better dancer.
Is everyone ready? DJ?
Oh Lord!
My God!
Looks like we have our finalists,
and we're ready for the last song in the contest. Hit it.
That was quite a show!
Let's hear it for our finalists.
I want you to vote for the best couple by a round of applause.
Maria Inez and Samir!
Luiz Pereira and Lina!
We won.
My baby!
Go!
Tonight's champions are Luiz and Lina!
Everybody's looking at us.
Use our secret word.
"Kiss"?
Congratulations, Luiz and Lina.
I have a surprise for the lovebirds.
And for all of you.
Our special guest is online.
Suellen Glória.
Luiz's real girlfriend.
Hello, everyone.
I'm at a spiritual retreat
because I was really hurt by what happened.
But I can only heal if I heal you too.
Just get to the point!
The truth is that Luiz and Lina…
just lied…
Lies… to…
-Draw the line… -It's freezing!
The truth is that Luiz and Lina…
That's it, everyone. Namaste.
"Namaste"? You prick!
What's that, Maria Inez?
She can prove that this couple is a fraud.
Maria Inez is right.
I had a relationship with Suellen Glória.
It was a real thing.
And I hired Lina as a fake wife.
I paid her to be my fiancée.
My engagement
is a fraud.
But I have to be honest.
We played around with love so much…
that I'm in love.
I told you that he was lying, Mom.
I've known it all along.
What?
Please, don't tell him.
Actually,
I'm the one who's been paying Lina.
That's it.
Perhaps the secret ingredient of the best love stories
is two big servings of solitude.
A woman wants to talk to you.
-A woman? -Yes.
Who?
Your mother-in-law.
I can lend you money. How much?
We make the same wage, and you spend twice as much.
What's left to lend?
-Don't you have anything to tell me? -Like what?
You're acting weird.
What?
That's why you did all this for me?
For money?
You're a freaking liar.
I am a liar.
But even though I lied,
I was really confused about this job
and what I was feeling
for you.
Turns out, this was my most difficult job.
To be myself with someone.
Have a nice life.
Here you go. It's all set.
Stay as long as you need. My house is your house.
Thanks, brother.
I got some clothes for you.
I'm here for you.
Hey, champ.
No openings.
We should have a kitchen here, man.
It's not that simple, man.
It's small, and I have three partners.
Keep looking, you'll find something. Google it.
-Hello. -Hi. How are you?
I'm here about the chef position.
It's been filled. Thank you.
KITCHEN ASSISTANT WANTED
Lina, I have to shut off the lights.
This is what Ms. Carlota is doing to me. My own mother.
Ms. Carlota has overprotected you.
-But she did something right. -What?
-Look at the man you've become. -I guess.
In six months, I've become a homemaker, a chef…
Someone's loved one.
If what I had with Lina were real,
we would be…
In phase three, real love. I know the rules.
I almost fell for the soul mate crap.
We try to find the one,
but we should be looking
for someone who brings out who we want to be.
Brother, what's keeping you
from becoming the man you want to be?
Just go for it.
It's on you.
Hello.
You talk to plants now?
This is the tree of happiness, right? I’m thanking it.
Making wishes.
You're funny.
I…
I told her
to stay here for as long as she needed.
But she decided to leave.
Did you lie about dying?
Of course not, Luiz.
Six months ago, my diagnosis said that I wouldn't get this far.
But it turned out
that you left home and,
I don't know, we both went through a healing process.
I seemed to get better after every test.
So, your problem was me.
Perhaps
the secret ingredient of the best love stories
is
two big servings of solitude.
I have myself,
you have yourself,
and we have one another.
No, I'm mad at you. You went too far.
No.
Luiz.
Do you have any idea how far I'd go
to see you happy?
You have no idea.
Why don't you spend the night with me?
We can watch a movie and have popcorn, just like the old days.
Okay.
Yay!
Popcorn!
-What is she doing here? -I got divorced.
I'm living in your room now.
Listen, I won't have you two picking on each other.
You should call a truce.
-Let's watch a movie. -That's better.
…have been blocked
between Pinheiros and Tietê freeways.
The end, that's it.
Cool.
I'll switch to the news. SÃO PAULO IS AT A STANDSTILL
The city literally stopped. If you look over there…
It's just São Paulo being São Paulo! Always chaos.
-The traffic is held up. -It's Lina!
-Look! -My career and my life are held up.
I'm trying to give up on everything, but I can't even do that.
It's unbelievable!
-What are you waiting for? Go find her. -Do something.
-Hurry up. -Just go.
LINA CALLING…
Hi, this is Lina.
If I didn't answer, I'm busy. Leave a message.
It's jammed everywhere.
NESTOR VIDEO CALL
Nestor, what's up?
Brother, I just saw Lina on TV.
I'm on my way to find her.
You can't get there by car.
Get a bike. Or run there if you have to.
There's no other way. I'm hanging up.
Can you give me a lift, man?
You're a lifesaver.
Listen, I give up.
-What? We're too far. -It's okay, I'll walk.
Brother,
I can't thank you enough. Thanks.
Can you open the trunk, please?
Thanks.
-It's far, I can take you there. -It's fine.
It's all the same around here.
Except for our outraged citizen, who's decided to walk.
She'll have to walk 10km to the airport,
but she doesn't seem to care.
Lina!
Lina!
Marry me.
Have sex with me. Work with me. Do everything with me.
Yes!
What's going on here, everyone?
Are you getting that, Robson?
We're celebrating the union of Luiz Pereira and Maria Abigail Maia.
Maria Abigail?
Lina is my stage name.
Another Maria in my life.
-It's my first exclusivity contract. -Okay.
Carlotinha, your heart is racing.
That's because of you, Ed.
Now you'll deal with the three phases of marriage.
Phase one, you're in love.
-It's happiness, right? -No. It's illusion.
-How's that? -Allan Kardec once said that…
-Allan Kardec? Please! -Seriously, you should read it.
My aunt sent it to me.
I'm divorced.
I've rebelled against the rules of society.
-Who's the square now? -You, Maria Inez.
Everybody gets divorced. Do you want to go against society?
Just stay married.
-Look what I brought to my sweetie. -You're here!
-Samir. -Yes?
-Why are you here? -No…
She invited me.
We're just hooking up.
He's my crush, my date.
After all, I am Maria Inez.
I'm unforgettable.
and you are the most pain-in-the-ass passenger I've ever had.
I have to do it a little higher, right?
Oh well, I don't have time to let you hear that, I'm late for the audition.
You know that this is the biggest opportunity...
...of your life, that if you get in your life will change. You haven't talked about anything else the whole journey. Go, go!
Oh well, I have to go. Oh, come on! Come on, come on! Wish me luck.
Oh well, whatever.
We can split it... Try to make it slow.
Sorry.
Come on, come on, come on, guys, we can do it. Nice hair.
Here I am, Ciro Lamanna.
You're late, registrations are already closed.
-Look, I come from the deep south. -Yes.
Do you know how deep the south is? A lot, it took me seven hours to get here,
-I have to enter. -I'm sorry, I can't do anything about it.
Ouch. Here it is, here it is.
-Damn. Oh, oh my God. -What's wrong?
-I don't feel well. -Wait, I'm going to get you some water.
-I don't feel well. -Wait, I'm going to get you some water. Thanks.
Yes, I'm coming, bro.
No, I'm... This year I'm in a B&B.
Well, where are you? At the beach?
And who is there?
Is Guenda there? No, I'm coming.
Is Guenda there? No, I'm coming. One minute, I leave my backpack and I'm there.
Who the fuck is it?
For the rooms.
Here we are.
Well... Nice house.
You like it? This is the first time I rent it,
because I can't work, I have the third of the lower fourth of the trapezoid...
This way I can make up for it.
-See? -And... what do you do? -Are you a fashion photographer? -No, no, I'm a GO lifeguard,
-Are you a fashion photographer? -No, no, I'm a GO lifeguard, guarantee of origin. And these are some of my clients who...
guarantee of origin. And these are some of my clients who...
Do you recognize that one there?
I mean, is it really her?
It's her. I was a great playboy, I was the number one in the area.
I had them all.
I have records, five women in a day without a pit stop.
Eating only a couple small bruschettas and things like that, you know?
And there? One who didn't succumb to your charm?
No, you mean that one? No, it's because the plaster...
No, you mean that one? No, it's because the plaster... of the photo is ruined... Let's go see your room, come on.
of the photo is ruined... Let's go see your room, come on.
-Here we are. -Oh, knock before you go in, knock.
Again with the joints, huh? With all the pussy around here, I say.
You're right.
-Oh well, this is your roommate. -No, what do you mean "my roommate"?
No, no, no, do I have to sleep with him? That is, the agreements were not these.
Hey, for 20 Euros, you wanted the Grand Hotel? Uh?
-He's right. -Move, come on.
-Hi. -Yo.
-Marco. -Hi. Yo. Do you smoke?
-No. No, no, thanks. -Better.
-Mom? -Hm?
Why don't we tell everyone you're my sister during these two weeks?
Why should we?
Uh... Why should someone approach a guy on holiday with his mother?
-I want to make friends, you know. -Mm-hm.
-Here, this way. -Right.
Welcome.
He uses talc as deodorant, from the voice he smokes 10-15 cigarettes per day,
very thin, bald and short.
He is just like that. Like you took a picture of him.
Hi, we booked a twin room, name is Marescalchi.
No, sorry, a twin room? We said two single rooms.
Well, if you want, I have two single rooms for the same price as the twin room.
-Deal. -Deal.
Oh, it's my mother, fuck. Shut up.
Yup?
You can't call me every two minutes, otherwise I'll lose my focus
You can't call me every two minutes, otherwise I'll lose my focus and I won't study.
Then they flunk me again. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, don't worry. Bye, mom. Bye, bye.
Fuck off. Sorry about that, it was that bitch of my mother.
They went to Tenerife and said, "You can't come with us this summer
because they flunked you for the third time, so you'll stay in Milan."
Fuck off! I mean, brother, do you really think I would spend the summer in Milan?
No bro, negative. So I booked this place and now we spend the summer together, you and me.
So I booked this place and now we spend the summer together, you and me.
-Are you happy, bro? -Oh, yes.
You are the best. Why are you here?
Well, I... I come here more or less every year.
This year I decided at the last second, but...
-In short, I ended up here. -Oh, right, fuck. Right.
This one or this one?
Bro, look, I'm honest, they're both ugly,
but you have to go to the beach, what the fuck do you care. I don't know.
What the fuck do I care, actually.
But why? Let me understand, do you have to fuck someone?
Because I can help you, brother. I am your man.
Uh, yes, yes, there's...
Uh, yes, yes, there's... There is a girl I like.
I mean, I like her a lot, but...
I mean, I like her a lot, but... she's been with someone for five years, so...
Come on, bro. I mean, you came here for a girl who's in a relationship for five years?
You're a fool, bro. I like you a lot.
What the fuck do you care.
Oh well, I'm going to the beach.
Exactly. We are going to the beach, because I want to see it. Let's go.
But if you hit on Guenda, I'll get pissed.
I won't hit on Guenda, brother. I would never do that.
-Go, go, go! -Yes, yes! Guenda, take it!
Guys, I'll go back to sleep.
Hey, can you give it back to me?
Hey, are you deaf?
-What? -The ball, can you give it back to me?
-Sorry, I didn't... I didn't see. -Eh, me neither.
-Sorry, I didn't... I didn't see. -Eh, me neither. It means we have something in common.
-Anyway, nice to meet you, I'm Furio. -Vincenzo.
Look, maybe after the game I can offer you a spritz
to make up for having made a fool of myself.
-Okay. -All right. See you later, then.
"See you later," what the fuck am I saying?
-Hey. So? How did it go? -Like crap.
-Hey. So? How did it go? -Like crap. You're not "fresh" enough, you're not "new" enough.
-What the fuck does that mean? -Dude, come on, don't take it personally.
Do you know how many "no" Sfera Ebbasta got?
He got what? Enough. I have enough.
I had also put on my lucky underpants.
Hallo.
No, no, I'm not the lifeguard. I don't work here. I don't work... How do I explain it in Kraut?
I don't work... How do I explain it in Kraut?
-Zwei? -Zwei?
Two, I understand, but I don't... I'll take them for you. Two?
I'll take them for you. Two?
-I'll put them here. -Ok.
Hey! Why are you moving the sunbeds?
Look, I'm sorry, I told them I don't work here,
but they don't speak a word of Italian, so...
Oh, sorry. Are you the new lifeguard? -No. -Too bad.
-No. -Too bad.
-Listen... Are you interested in a job? -What job?
Eh, the mountain guide! We're at the sea, aren't we? The lifeguard!
Are you interested? From Monday to Saturday, 250 per week, you start at 6:00.
If you need accommodation, there is a room behind where my dummy son Furio sleeps.
So, do you accept?
Eh, God, I don't know. Am I in? I'm in.
Oh, I almost forgot. Can you swim?
If I can swim?
I dive from ten meters and go twenty meters under water in apnea.
-Uh, a dolphin. -More like a tuna.
No, no, the team doesn't work.
Can I play center-back?
Come on Gue, please.
Can you explain why you never pass me the ball?
And can you explain why you put "like" on that ass picture?
Still with that ass? You're pathetic...
Guys, guys, take a break. The tournament starts tomorrow.
-Hi, guys. -Hello, Marco!
-You did it, finally. -Yes, yes.
Oh! Phlegm is here.
Bro, she called you Phlegm!
Yes, but because it seems that I'm not really lively, but it's only because I don't talk too much.
-Ah, okay, then. -Marco, how come you are here?
-Ah, okay, then. -Marco, how come you are here? Weren't you supposed to stay home this year?
Yeah. Yes, but I found a way, in the end.
-Oh well, he's... -Tommy!
Tommy, bro. Guys, it's an easy name. Hi. -Oh, nice to meet you.
-Hi, nice to meet you. -Hey, Gue...
So, Gue? How are you?
Good. I'm great. Does it seem like something's wrong? Everything is alright.
Good. I'm great. Does it seem like something's wrong? Everything is alright. No, no, mine was a cliché question.
You know, the ones you ask when, I mean, you don't even care about the answer.
-Oh. -No, it's not that I don't care,
on the contrary. No, I... It was just a question, Guenda, I didn't want to make you nervous...
Okay, I'm going.
See you later.
Bebo broke up with her, she's down.
Bebo broke up with her?
Sorry, I didn't understand. Bebo broke up with her?
Are you talking behind my back?
No, no, we... we were putting together the team.
Tommy, can you play beach volley?
-I can smash. -Great.
So Marco plays offense, Furio is the reserve... and we are missing a player.
So Marco plays offense, Furio is the reserve... and we are missing a player. -Hi, my love, how are you? -Him.
-Hi, my love, how are you? -Him.
The new lifeguard.
Yes, I'm at work. I know, look...
Bebo broke up with her. Period.
Can you believe it? They hired me like that, without even thinking about it.
So you won't come back? Will you stay there the whole season?
Why would I want to come back, Vio?
To hear my parents tell me "stop dreaming" and get me to work in the grocery store
To hear my parents tell me "stop dreaming" and get me to work in the grocery store -to cut the salami? Me? -Oh, well.
-to cut the salami? Me? -Oh, well. -Are you sure you won't forget me? -Ciro, come give me a hand!
-Are you sure you won't forget me? -Ciro, come give me a hand!
Yes, I'm coming, Rodolfo.
My love, it may be strange, but I have to go to work.
-It is so. Kisses. Bye. -Ciro!
I'm coming, Rodolfo.
Furio! There are water crates to move.
I can't, I sprained my ankle playing beach volley!
I should be a lifeguard here, can you believe it?
-Have you felt it? -Mh.
A carbonara without cream just passed us by.
-A what? -A carbonara without cream.
A carbonara without cream?
You know that girls are divided into two categories, right?
The carbonaras without cream and those with cream.
-Mh. -You know that in the carbonara the... -the cream... -It's needed.
It's not. Fuck, Vincenzo, there's no cream.
That's why the best are those without, right?
Less effective in appearance but more authentic in taste.
-They are more beautiful. -Dunno.
The thing is you are all obsessed with beauty, you know?
When actually it is the only thing I don't care about.
I mean, I fall in love with the skin, the voice, the smell...
-Vincenzo. -Mh?
But you, the carbonara...
You tasted it, right?
No. I never tasted the carbonara you mean.
I can't see you, but don't make that face, okay?
Look, I'll help you, okay? I'll make you eat the best carbonara of your life.
No. No, Furio. Look, never mind. I suck with women.
I have an idea.
Ok, I downloaded the app, now I'll set up your profile...
You still haven't told me which app it is.
So, basically is... This is an app that tries to create chemistry between...
between people with common interests, even distant ones, to... to fuck.
It's to fuck, yes.
You give them a like and if they like you back, then you can...
Yes, you forgot another detail, though.
Ah, you're blond, I didn't write it. Vincenzo, 22, tall, blond...
And available for blind dates.
It's funny. See, when you want you can do it.
-This stuff is funny. -Okay.
Anyway, don't worry. I describe you the girls and you say "like" or "go to hell".
It's simple, isn't it?
Hey, fucking watch your step!
So, I was telling you, last night, beer pong tournament.
There comes two pros, because nobody has beaten them for months,
I win with the first, there's the second one, but by then
I had already drank 12 beers and I was totally drunk...
I throw, I hit, I win.
Now there's my picture up there. Do you want to see it?
Yes, why not, maybe after the movie tonight.
No, babe, speaking of tonight, I don't... I don't feel like it.
I'm still in hangover, I'm tired. I want to rest. Let's do it tomorrow.
Tomorrow? But our anniversary is today.
Come on, babe, what's one day more? I'll call you later.
-Hi. -Hi.
So you will stay all summer in my room. Yes, your father wanted it, not me.
All right. Let's clarify some things right away. The room is tiny.
They are two uncomfortable cots, yours is even more uncomfortable.
If the key is in the lock, I'm making carbonara, so don't enter.
-Carbonara? -Carbonara.
Oh. And does it happen often?
Basically never, but I don't give up.
Instead, if the door handle is upwards, I'm sleeping.
And this happens... all the time.
I already feel at home.
-Usually he's nicer, you know. -I bet.
-He feels his territory invaded. -What the fuck am I, a cocker spaniel?
Look, we're missing a player for the beach volley tournament.
Do you want to join the team? We noticed your build.
But why are you asking him?
What were we saying?
The winners get tickets for the end of summer concert.
The losers run naked all over the beach. It would be nice to see you lose.
But maybe, who knows... I'll see you naked anyway.
-So, are you with us? -All right.
Okay. See you tomorrow.
And tonight we're going to a party, you coming?
Which party is it?
Mom, it's a night at the disco, at Byblos.
-But... -No, don't you get upset, calm down.
I'll go with Furio and all the others. -With whom?
With Furio, with some of my friends.
-Your friends? But... -Mom. -Summer, sun, Riccione, friends... -Mm-hm.
-I have to make carbonara. -What?
-Come in. Come in. -Thank you.
Not you.
Fuck. Come on, bro.
Bro, there they are.
Bro, there's Guenda. Tonight she's yours, bro. Trust me, she's yours.
But you have to take this shirt off, because you look like a jerk.
-Listen to me. -What the fuck are you saying?
Bro, trust me. Okay? No problem.
-What an asshole! -What did I do?
But no, not you. It is my ex, who posts pictures non-stop with a girl in Ibiza.
-But this shirt? -Oh no, it's shit.
-They lent it to me, it's not mine. -What?
No, I said it's shit.
And she's ugly too! Look!
He does it to make you jealous, you know?
Often lately wars are fought also on social media.
You think?
Yes. And in fact you should do it too, so maybe he gets pissed.
-Wait, look... -Great idea! Nice! Thanks, Marco.
You're welcome.
Please, boys.
No. No, you can't enter.
-Why? -There is a dress code.
Then, if you didn't notice, the oldest one here is 25 years old.
So? It's a public place, open to everyone, I enter.
-No. -I want to talk to the owner.
The owner is having dinner and if I go bother him because a fifty-year-old...
The owner is having dinner and if I go bother him because a fifty-year-old... -Fifty who? -...wants to enter an under 30 party,
-Fifty who? -...wants to enter an under 30 party, -it means that I can't do my job well. -What a shitty job.
-it means that I can't do my job well. -What a shitty job.
Let's pretend that I didn't hear because the music was too loud. You two, come on.
-Come in. Come. -How much do you want to get me in?
Let it go.
In here there's my son with some strangers, I need to know if he's okay.
Look, trust me. Don't bother your son who's with friends and is having fun.
My son is blind. He needs assistance.
But why do I have to explain it to you?
-Just let me in! -Do you want to know if he's okay?
-Just let me in! -Do you want to know if he's okay? -Does he have a phone? Call him. -That's it!
-Does he have a phone? Call him. -That's it!
What the fuck...
-Four years... -Why that voice?
Well, because it's not exactly the anniversary I expected.
Then, I don't know, lately we're just talking bullshit.
-But did you say that thing to him? -What?
About the scholarship to go to Canada. No, not yet. He is always with friends, there is never a right time.
No, not yet. He is always with friends, there is never a right time.
And I don't know, a year apart...
Who is this stalker who sends you 20 messages per second?
Luca, Matteo, Francesco,
and then there's another one, but I don't remember his name.
And when would you have met them?
No, I haven't met them yet.
-Meaning? Let me see. -Look.
-He is cute, like him. -No, Bea, come on.
Come on! Look, you talk to him, it's fun, trust me.
-I have a boyfriend. -So?
He stood you up on your anniversary.
And you won't get pregnant for a chat.
Well, this one has a slutty face, I'll like her.
There's already a match, you can message. Go.
No, Fu', but what can I tell her, come on...
I mean, I really don't know what to say to a girl I met on an app.
-Met on an app? -Hm.
They are the best ones you can meet, do you understand? Message her.
-Fucking send her a message! -I don't know what to...
Okay, okay, I'll send her a message! Okay, okay.
"Hi, I'm Vincenzo". Send.
-Oh, are you happy? -Hm, was it difficult?
-No. -"Hi, I'm Vincenzo. Send."
-She has already answered you. -What did she say?
"Nice to meet you... Camilla"? But wasn't she called Bea?
No! Put me down! Leave me alone, I will sue you! Put me down!
What's happening, Fu'?
Nothing, they're taking away an old alcoholic lady who...
I swear, it sounded like my mother's voice, really.
-Why, is your mother an old alcoholic? -No, come on...
-Let's go dancing. -Let's go.
-Mara? -Hi.
Hi. Mara?
I think she fell in love tonight, too.
-Oh well, drink her shot. -Okay.
Hi!
-Hey, he's Ciro. -Hi.
-Hi. -What are we celebrating?
-That thing that ends with "right". -Meaning?
-The pussy, right? -Yeah!
Here it is, Riccione, it's coming!
I can't believe it.
Look who she took the photo with. With the lifeguard.
I swear, it seems like she's making fun of me.
When I want to be noticed, nobody cares about me, and when I want to disappear...
When I want to be noticed, nobody cares about me, and when I want to disappear... everyone notices, always. Unbelievable.
Bro, can I tell you something? You are annoying.
You are really fucking annoying.
I mean, they call you Phlegm? Ask yourself why and then answer.
-Bro, changing the subject, do you snore? -Yes.
Great.
I can't find my earplugs, where the fuck are they?
What is this stuff?
She took a picture with the lifeguard.
What is it?
Valentina, Michelle...
This one comes from Germany, it's from 1993.
This one wrote a love letter to tell him that she had had a great summer.
I guess Gualtiero is not full of shit, huh?
Go, Gualtiero.
Guys, seducing a woman is an art.
And I should reveal my secrets to you? Come on.
With all the chicks around here, you keep liking the same girl.
I understand, if it weren't so I wouldn't be in love.
You're out of your mind.
She hasn't noticed you for five years and you're still going after her? Come on!
Tell him you didn't go on holiday with your friends to be with Guenda, come on.
-Do we have to tell him everything? -Yes, bro.
You don't need the "pick up guru", that's me.
You need a shrink!
Look, gramps, spoiler him some moves, so we'll get this thing over with.
Spoiler... spoiler... What...?
Look, can we leave now?
He has been out of the game for a while. The last letter is from '99, let's go.
Boy, in 1999 we invented email.
-Yes, okay, let's go to the beach. -Let's go.
Oh well, come on, I'll help you seduce this Guenda girl.
But you clean my house in return.
Where is the degreaser?
-Hey! -Emma!
Ciro!
Emma, Emma, you're strangling me. Emma, what are you doing here?
They hired me at the Grand Hotel as a waitress, I'll stay here until September.
-Cool. -Hey.
The game is tomorrow at two. You will be there, right?
Yes. She is Emma, my girlfriend's best friend.
Ah, so you're my best friend. Mara, nice to meet you.
-Emma. -Bye.
Bye. She's like that, she's always joking.
I'm too happy you're here, so we can go together to parties, to happy hours...
Even at the beach I will come here, so, I don't know, can I ask you for...
-for the sunbeds? -Yes. -No. -Why not?
Oh no, because... because it's full. It's full. Look, the last one, the last one... Was taken by the lady over there.
So what about that sign?
30% DISCOUNT FOR SEASONAL SUBSCRIPTIONS
What do I know? Maybe...
What do I know? Maybe... Maybe someone died, they die without warning here.
Maybe someone died, they die without warning here. Oh well, where do you want the sunbed, miss?
-Sea front? -I wish!
-After you. -Thanks.
Good morning. A pack of Valerian, thanks.
Good morning. A pack of Valerian, thanks. - Right away. - Given the anxiety, I would take two.
- Right away. - Given the anxiety, I would take two.
Oh, hi.
- Oh God, but... is that my fault? - Oh yeah. You hit the bullseye.
- Oh God, but... is that my fault? - Oh yeah. You hit the bullseye. Excuse me, I exaggerated.
When it comes to Vincenzo, I lose my mind.
Oh, but I'm sure the judge will give you the extenuating circumstances
for anxious mothers.
Come on, I'm kidding.
It's part of my job, it happens. Misfits, boozers...
Moms out of their mind...
Do you know? I had a mother like that, too. How annoying.
Listen, could you charge me with this, too? Dry ice. Thanks.
Do you think that 12 euros are enough to make me withdraw the complaint?
-Why, did you already do it? -Who can tell?
How could you, if you don't even know my name?
Right, if you tell me, we'll complete the report. I'm Lucio.
Irene.
Blondes, brunettes, dark-haired, Americans, mulattos...
there is only one method to have them all.
- To listen. - Come on! Is this your advice?
I listen to them, but they don't fuck with me anyway.
Maybe you don't know how to listen well. Those ones over there, for example, look.
So, tell me about them.
Um... I don't know.
Those two have just met, you can see it right away.
Do you see she's embarrassed because she hasn't talked to a man alone for so long?
She touches her hair, see? She touches them.
And him? And he... What the fuck do I know?
And he... What the fuck do I know?
Let's see if you like it.
God! How much garlic did you put in it? I'll kill everyone at the game with this.
Why? It is very little.
Listen, about the game...
I saw that Mara, the one you introduced me to earlier... you two are very close, uh?
No, I really mean... a lot.
-What do you mean? -You've been here one day,
and it seems like you've known each other forever.
-I see, Viola told you to check on me. -No.
Don't talk BS because I know you.
She told me that if there is someone who...
who hits on you, I have the license to kill. Nothing else.
So you'll have to work a lot, baby.
Look at that one, the one dressed in green. Tell me.
See, she's a problematic type, she reasons more with this than with this.
She makes all her plans and if you mess with them, she flips.
Fuck, you know about females, huh?
Oh, I'm the chicks' search engine. You click... and I answer.
Could you give me my cell phone back?
You lent it to me to chat.
Yes, but I didn't tell you "flirt with a guy all night long". And from my profile.
I didn't flirt with him all night long. We talked.
Oh, yes? About what?
Because I'm curious to know if you've used dirty talk from my phone.
Bro, no dirty talk, we talked about Star Wars.
You... Hang on a second. Are you kidding me?
This is an app that people download to fuck.
You... If you talk about Star Wars, she'll run off.
And... Sorry, but did you see Star Wars?
Everybody has seen it.
Hm. I mean... I figured you wouldn't like it.
Oh well, anyway, that's not the point. Camilla is different.
I mean, she's smart, she's educated, she's fun...
Oh, that's her for sure.
Hi. Do you know that the song you recommended to me is really cool?
I told her that I have a broken keyboard, so we send each other voice messages.
A ge... A fucking genius. You are a genius, Vince'!
And you're a smart ass, you've even finished my chips.
-Can I ask you a serious question? -Um.
Have you ever fallen in love?
Me? Four hundred times, at least. Oh, for five minutes...
Me? Four hundred times, at least. Oh, for five minutes... Gualtiero, please.
Do you want to tell me that you've never met a woman
-who was really worth it? Never? - Sure. Her. Look.
But if you've never noticed me...
You have to find something that allows you to be with her
and show her that you are the man she wants, do you understand?
Dunno. I mean, her boyfriend just broke up with her, but...
Bingo! She's yours. -Really? -She's yours.
In case you change your mind...
Even with the old ones?
Oh, well... young women can wait, they can die at any moment.
All right. Bye, Gualtiero.
-See you later. -Bye.
Come.
Block.
What the fuck, Emma.
7-2.
-What an embarrassment. -They're kicking our ass, huh?
I really don't understand. I mean, he broke up me like that, out of the blue.
He turned off his phone, didn't answer for three days...
Do you think it's normal? -I can't believe it. -I mean, I know he sounds like an asshole,
-I can't believe it. -I mean, I know he sounds like an asshole, but it's not like that. Maybe he's... maybe he's just scared.
but it's not like that. Maybe he's... maybe he's just scared.
Who does not fear love? It's scary to you, isn't it?
You bet it scares me.
We've always talked a lot, you know?
And he has always been very attentive with me, protective...
However, it is as if in the last period something has broken, just like that.
But we have a very strong bond, before I left we made love
and... and he held me so tight...
I can't believe he doesn't want me anymore, really.
And nothing, in the end she said to me, "Marco, you are like a brother to me."
I mean, a brother, you know? So...
Come on, it doesn't seem so bad to me.
No, in fact it is a disaster.
-Oh well, she friendzoned you, good. -What did she do?
-Oh well, she friendzoned you, good. -What did she do? Friendzoned. It means that she no longer sees him as a hypothetical boyfriend,
Friendzoned. It means that she no longer sees him as a hypothetical boyfriend,
but more as a possible playmate, you see?
What a desperate case...
Anyway, it's still dirty there.
Yes, but where did I go wrong?
Where did you go wrong? You are too compliant.
Do you understand?
She must think that she can count on you, but up to a certain point.
-Yes, so what? -So tomorrow you go and tell her,
-Yes, so what? -So tomorrow you go and tell her, -"Listen, Babo..." -Bebo.
-"Listen, Babo..." -Bebo. Bebo, Babo, it's the same.
"He broke up with you because you are too spoiled." There you go.
"He broke up with you because you are too spoiled." There you go. He's trolling you.
-Yes, of course, I won't tell her that. -What was I doing?
-Yes, of course, I won't tell her that. -What was I doing? Trolling. -"Trolling" is a word used on social media
Trolling. -"Trolling" is a word used on social media
when the intent is to instigate or take the piss.
Guys, how the fuck do you two talk?
If you want to seduce her, you have to listen to what I tell you.
Do you understand? And I'm not "frolling" you!
-No, it's trolling, with a T. -Trolling with a T.
-No, it's trolling, with a T. -Trolling with a T. -Tro. -All right.
Tro. Hm.
See? You eventually became a lifeguard.
Yes, I think it was a mistake, though.
Being a lifeguard here in Riccione is an honor.
-Oh God, you think? -Many girls come here for this.
Yes, but the lifeguard at the end of the day should be awake,
but I'm super sleepy.
I don't think that's the problem. You have a girlfriend.
And how do you know?
Bad girls know how to recognize a good guy.
Come on, go to sleep.
Alone, though.
Hey, how are you doing? I'm a bit down...
Is everything okay? Can I call you?
Yup.
"Call Camilla."
-Hello? -Hey, Cami. Hi.
-Hello? -Hey, Cami. Hi. -Hi. -Um... it's nice to hear your voice.
-Hi. -Um... it's nice to hear your voice. I mean, not just in a message.
Oh, are you out? Am I bothering you?
No, no, no, I'm... I'm going home.
Pass it to me now. Come on, do a forward pass.
If you can't play it is not my problem.
If you can't play it is not my problem. Enough, you guys, shut up!
-But how the fuck do you play? -Bro, pick another game.
-Wake up! -I don't like it.
I have been a lifeguard for two years and no girl ever noticed me.
You are so beautiful that I hate you for how perfect you are.
-Don't touch me or I'll hit you. -Just a toke, come on.
Furio, enough! I can't stand it anymore!
Damn! Every night is the same. Don't you have shit to do?
Every night is the same. Don't you have shit to do? What the fuck!
-Oh, concentrate. -Bro!
Girls like me!
At the age of 13 I decided that I would go to university in Canada,
then I waited another ten to be old enough.
I even won a scholarship. But now...
Now leaving scares you to death.
Yeah. Because, in the end, I like it here.
Maybe my mother is right. I mean, maybe it doesn't make sense to go.
You know that during winter temperatures reach -22 °F?
I didn't know that. But I do know a lot about apprehensive mothers.
Why? How's yours like?
Um... Let's say she changed.
I mean, basically at 14 my father left her and so she doesn't trust anyone anymore.
I became the only man in her life.
Hey, young man.
You can't sleep on the beach.
No, I just... Can you lower the light, please?
Excuse me. Excuse me, it's my roommate, you see...
What are you doing? Is that a fine?
-Sure. -But I'm not a car.
But... in your opinion...
Instead of talking like this, I don't know,
I don't know if you'd like it if... if we meet.
I think it's the purpose of the app, isn't it?
You start by texting and then... you meet.
Um, yes, it's true.
-But we can also not-- -Yes.
-Yes, it's okay to talk on the phone, too. -Yup.
-Yes, it's okay to talk on the phone, too. -Yup. It's fine, I like it a lot.
Can we, I don't know, be... virtual friends?
Um... yes, I... I really like virtual friendships.
I mean, not that I have so many. But... yes, I like them.
Fine. Then we are virtual friends.
Um... virtual friends.
-Cami, open up! -Fuck.
Did something happen? Is everything alright?
Yes, don't worry, but my father is back. Talk to you later.
Hey.
Come with me, get on.
I actually told Bea that tonight she could sleep here.
I'm sorry. Maybe tomorrow.
I'm sorry. Maybe tomorrow. Of course.
-Good night. -Good night.
Emma, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but please, where I sleep is a nuthouse.
There's always someone, I have to wake up at six,
I'm a mess all day... Please, you have to help me.
Ciro, how can I help you right now, I was sleeping. I don't...
Ciro, how can I help you right now, I was sleeping. I don't... Maybe the next room is free, downstairs...
Maybe the next room is free, downstairs... But if there's no one downstairs you can't take the keys. I don't know.
But... can I sleep here?
-Here where? -Here.
-In bed with me? -Eh.
Thank you.
-You ready? -Go, move!
-Come on, good, good. -Go.
Come on, be still.
I'll go down. Pull your chin up, your chin up.
Welcome to Baths 66. The most anticipated event of the year.
What are you dressed up as?
-I'm a pin-up. -Go, go, go!
-You know? I think we're paired together. -You think?
Attention, please. Let's make some noise!
Come on, put the apple in position, quick, it's about to start.
Yes, but you're too tall. I can't get up there.
You ready? Don't cheat...
-If you laugh, it falls! -Go!
Here they are, they are starting.
Lower yourself a bit, otherwise my calves hurt and I can't stand on my toes.
-Okay... -Good. No, no...
-Wait, go slower. Go slow. -If we go slow we lose, Vincenzo.
-I guess you are right. -Hey, they started already!
-I guess you are right. -Hey, they started already! -Go. -Come on, I'll get you in my arms. Go!
We can see the cheerleader and the Indian getting ahead.
Here is the rastaman... Oh! They are thrown off balance.
Here is the rastaman... Oh! They are thrown off balance. Wait! There's a twist. The pin-up hops aboard.
-Aboard whom? -Shut up, you unbalance me! Oh!
And they won! Give them an applause!
You have to drink it all, now! Drink it all!
Drink it all! Drink it all! Drink it all!
Oh, well, now you have to drink it all.
Oh, well, now you have to drink it all. -What? -Oh, yeah.
No!
Well done! Come on, another round of applause!
I don't drink! -My head is already spinning. -But at least now you are smiling.
-My head is already spinning. -But at least now you are smiling.
Cut it out!
-Your mother has picked up a guy. -Really?
I know, it's weird. We have never met and we tell each other everything.
Oh well, it's a bit like talking to a psychologist. Yes, but at least he answers.
Look, but... what does Gio say? Does he know?
No.
But I'm not doing anything wrong, Bea. I told you, we're virtual friends.
And does the psychologist know you have a boyfriend?
No.
Look, Cami, what's wrong with you?
It's four years you don't even notice a hot guy passing by
and now you are doing the "froufrou" for a guy you've never even seen?
-"Froufrou"? -Yep. -I'm not "froufrou". -No...
What the fuck does it mean? Okay, listen. Don't get pissed off. Forget it.
-Isn't it a bit too much? -No.
What do you say? Can we sit for a couple of minutes?
Sorry, but you got together with a woman who doesn't hold her beer.
I know, but we're a great couple. A winning one.
Hm. It's strange though, because...
usually I never win as a couple.
-Are you married? -Luckily no, not anymore.
You don't know what he told me right before leaving me.
"For me this life is too heavy." And he left me alone with Vincenzo.
Yes, because I'm heavy.
How can you not be heavy when you have to think of everything?
I liked to have fun, go out... go dancing, too.
You don't know how long it's been since I had a real laugh, you know?
Of those that hurt your cheekbones.
Do you know?
Yes. This afternoon.
Fuck, the keys.
What are you doing here? You lost the keys, I brought them back to you.
Thanks. Thank you very much.
You were very nice to bring me back my keys, but... Actually, if you could give me back my shirt,
-since it's the only clean one I have... -Why don't you take it off from me?
No, no, Mara, really. It's better if you go. Go.
-Why, what would you do? -No, I won't do anything, but...
Oh well, I'll take it off myself.
Ciro! Ouch. Fuck! Yeah?
Ouch. Fuck! Yeah?
-Are you there? -Yes, um... I was... sleeping. What's up?
-Are you there? -Yes, um... I was... sleeping. What's up? Violante wants to talk to you.
My girlfriend. My girlfriend.
-Yes. I'm coming. -Eh.
-Yes. I'm coming. -Eh. Get there. There is my girlfriend, you have to stay still.
Get there. There is my girlfriend, you have to stay still.
-Yup? -Ah, you did it.
I've been knocking forever. Bye, Vio. See you later.
-Bye, Emma. -Vio!
How nice of you to call me now!
-Hi, sweetheart! -Hi.
I miss you a lot, love. You know, last night I dreamed about you.
No, I... I missed myself a lot, too.
What is it?
Nothing, see? I can move it that way, too.
Love, I was telling you that last night I dreamed that we were behind a car
and I were doing like this.
No, Vio, what are you doing?
I take my shirt off. Now it's your turn.
No... Vio, what do you want to do? Vio.
Love, we won't see each other for three months. We have to cope somehow, right?
Vio, what if they see us?
Vio, what if they see us? But who?
Who, Vio? Russian hackers, they are everywhere,
they take pictures and then send them on the Internet, it's a mess.
-Um, Vio... -My God, Ciro...
My God.
Listen, Viola, I have to go. I have to go to work, okay?
Oh, well. We'll continue tonight. You call me, love. Bye.
Bye. What the fuck are you doing?
Yes?
Ciro, I'm sorry. Can you give me my phone charger?
Yup!
So, get in... Get in there.
Here it is.
-Why are you crying? -Nothing...
-I messed up at work. -Oh, okay.
Do you want to take a walk with me?
-Now? -Yeah.
-Actually, I had to... -Are you busy?
No, um... No.
My tray gets off balance and bam! It ends up all over him.
What an embarrassment.
Even because, you know, at that point in the movies he looks at you,
Even because, you know, at that point in the movies he looks at you, love sparks... No, nothing.
He got super pissed off, he was screaming in Swedish, everyone was watching,
he was screaming in Swedish, everyone was watching, -so the head waiter arrived as well. -What did he say to you?
-so the head waiter arrived as well. -What did he say to you?
I don't know, he is from Bergamo and I didn't understand a word,
but obviously he was pissed off.
Yes, but eating fish-fry is not the best solution.
What should I do, Ciro?
At work I risk being fired after a week, it's a miracle if a boy notices me
and when they do, I throw mussels all over them. I...
and when they do, I throw mussels all over them. I... Sometimes I really think I'm a very bad sub-sub-brand of Bridget...
Sorry.
Oh well, at least we have wine.
I don't know, Emma.
I came here to sing and I find myself moving sunbeds and umbrellas all day.
And me? I have top grades in university,
but I always look like a fool because I can't carry two plates at the same time.
Why do you want to be a singer?
I don't know, I've always wanted to do it.
Yes, but why?
I don't know.
The truth is that maybe...
I always wanted to be a singer more than sing.
I imagined stadiums full of people shouting your name,
photos, autographs, groupies...
Instead it takes discipline, talent. You have work your ass off.
Instead it takes discipline, talent. You have work your ass off. And I don't know if I want to.
Anyway, I too don't know what I want to do.
I mean, I don't know if I want to continue with university.
Oh, come on, you're a nerd!
I'm not a nerd! It's just that I have a good memory, but...
I don't know if I want to change faculty or if I want to change city.
Anyway, Riccione is really beautiful.
I'll tell it to Violante!
Sorry! What the fuck...
-I got hurt. -Are you hurt?
-I got hurt. -Are you hurt? Here. Yes. Look here.
Here. Yes. Look here.
No!
What an asshole!
It's disgusting!
Come on! Are you breathing?
I scared you, huh?
Come on, let's go to sleep.
-Look. -What's up?
Bebo looked at the story I posted the other night.
Marco, your plan to make him jealous worked, look!
I'm going to make others, thanks.
Guenda!
Bebo was right to break up with you.
-Why? -Because you're a spoiled brat, Guenda.
Why, for what reason? What did I do?
For what reason, you know...
It is obvious, Guenda, you're always on social media tweeting,
counting likes... You've become a person who thinks only about herself.
Fuck you, Marco! Guenda, I didn't want to tell you! They threatened me, Guenda!
Guenda, I didn't want to tell you! They threatened me, Guenda!
Bro, you came out of the friendzone.
Shut up, okay? Please.
Stop for a moment.
You're probably better without these, right?
With, you're better with them. With these she'll notice you for sure.
Who has to notice me?
Camilla. Isn't she at the palms?
No, look, I won't go to the palms even if you drag me, I tell you.
Well, then I don't have to drag you too much, because we're already here.
What do you mean "we are already here"?
Give me the phone, I need to see the picture.
But you're an asshole, come on!
Oh, there she is.
Fuck.
-Come. -Slowly.
Hey. Hi.
Have we met before?
Don't you recognize him?
-No. -There you go. Can we leave, please?
Come on, don't play hard to get, you've been texting for days.
Ah! Oh God, I can't believe it, are you the psychologist?
-No. -The psychologist?
No, but her voice is not like that.
It is softer.
It's like every word has a laugh in it, you know?
You know, those contagious laughs that you burst out laughing
even though there is nothing to laugh about.
Or when you hear music for the first time.
You feel that it fills the room and then you realize that it has filled you too.
You know, I would recognize that voice immediately.
Hey. What's up? Did I say something wrong?
No.
You didn't say anything wrong.
-It's you. -Yes.
Sorry if I didn't tell you before, I just didn't want to ruin everything.
Oh well, but... I really don't care.
Look... I don't know, would you like to have something at the bar?
So you're telling me you used the app from your friend's phone.
Yes, right.
So you're not blonde with fuchsia ends.
No, I'm redhead with dark eyes.
Well, I'm nothing special, I don't think you'd ever notice me.
No, I would.
Because you have a very good scent.
Can I touch your face?
Sure.
You are exactly as I imagined you.
Anyway... I'm single too, you know?
Anyway... I'm single too, you know? If you are interested...
She's not interested.
-So only mussels today? -Yeah. Exactly.
Hey.
-Hey, Vincenzo, love. -Hey.
Uh, mom, don't wait for me tonight. I'll be late.
But... did you change shampoo?
-Did you go to the hairdresser? -No.
I bet you did.
There's nothing wrong with that. But admit that you like him.
-Who? -Who? The bodyguard, you know?
Even my friends saw you with him.
-All right, bye. -Bye.
Oh, come on, you're even wearing your silk dress? What are we talking about?
-Bye, come on, go. Bye, love. -Yes, bye.
Look, what if I invite you to dinner tonight?
-What if I tell you no? -Oh well, I'll ask someone else.
No, put me down!
Come on, put your helmet on. Just like that?
No, I've always worked in nightclubs.
But before being a bouncer, I worked inside.
-Bartender? -No!
-Stripper. -Really?
Of course. I used to dance on the pole.
Are you crazy?
-Come on, I'm joking. -Thank goodness.
-Come on, I'm joking. -Thank goodness. My cheekbones hurt.
No, I studied Law for two years, but it was a deadly bore, it wasn't for me.
No, I studied Law for two years, but it was a deadly bore, it wasn't for me. So I started working nights.
-What's up? -Nothing.
-Come on! -Stop, we'll end up in the water!
Let's dive. -But it's dangerous. -No, come on, let's dive.
-But it's dangerous. -No, come on, let's dive. But it's dark!
I live in the dark.
Come on, let's go!
I found a towel. How cold!
Did I mention that they are the best of the Riviera?
Vincenzo is not picking up, and the tracking is disabled.
Tracking?
Yes, this way I know where he is if he gets lost.
Come on, Irene, don't worry, if he needs you, he'll call you.
Come on, taste them.
No, I don't want it anymore. I'm... I'm too shaken.
You eat it for me.
Irene, wait.
You are a wonderful mother, but every now and then...
you forget you are also a woman.
If your child needs you, you have to forget about a lot of things.
Yes, of course, you're right, but...
You can't forget to be happy.
Mom?
Mom?
Is that you?
Anyway, I saw that Camilla girl on the beach with another guy.
-Does Vinz know? -No, I don't think so.
Then we have to tell him, guys.
-How the fuck do you eat? -Shut up, he's coming.
Hey, Vi'.
-Come, sit down. -Um, no, I can't, I have to see Camilla.
Right, speaking of Camilla... There is something you should know about--
No. Stop right there. I don't care if she has an ugly nose or a flaccid ass,
I don't care.
Also because maybe it's the first time I've fallen in love
and I've never been so happy.
What did you have to tell me?
Tell him.
That... that... Never mind.
Nothing important, just... Nothing important.
-See you later, then. -Alright.
-Great. -See you later.
-Bye. -Bye.
What could I do? He leaves in a week, he is happy, at least he enjoys it.
Okay, here's the team.
Marco serves, Emma defends, you two on the sides,
-and I try not to let it fall. -What about me?
-Reserve. -Okay, hands here.
Perfect. Come on, guys.
One, two, three, go!
The semifinal is about to start.
Bath 66 against Playa del Sol.
Go, go, go!
Come on, come on!
Mara serves, the opponent responds,
-the ball goes out. Our point! -Yes!
We are 20 to 21, we need one more point.
Hey, I'm sorry. Um...
tonight there's the happy hour at the Flamingo and I was wondering
tonight there's the happy hour at the Flamingo and I was wondering if you would like to come with me.
No, look, I'm sorry, but you look just like that asshole of my ex.
-So? -Too many bad memories.
I'm going crazy! I don't know what to do. Do you understand? I don't know.
What the fuck are you doing?
No, tell me, because you're being ridiculous.
Ok, the game with Guenda is not over yet, so tell me what you are doing.
What game?
I'm playing alone here. She didn't notice me before and she's not doing it now.
It's her.
Answer, put it on speaker.
Yeah. Yeah.
-Hello? -Hi, Marco. Can we meet?
Yes, sure. Right now?
I thought about what you told me.
-You were right. -Really?
Yes.
I'm sorry if I reacted like that in the beginning, but...
I'm not used to honest people like you.
I made a lot of mistakes with him.
I demanded too much, I was... I was spoiled, like you said.
So I sent him a message apologizing...
and he replied that he wants to try again!
Thanks Marco, it's all thanks to you.
It's a pleasure.
How are you? Hm?
Love, you know, they told me here in the hotel that tonight there's the sardine festival, why don't we go?
there's the sardine festival, why don't we go? If it stops raining, otherwise...
No mom, I'm going out with my girlfriend tonight.
And since when do you have a girlfriend? That's why you turned off the tracking.
No. But I can't believe you still use it, where am I, under house arrest?
Yes, but who is she? What if she's a crook? What if she is teasing you?
What if she has any illnesses? -No, I want to meet her. -I hope you're kidding.
-No, I want to meet her. -I hope you're kidding.
No, love, a guy like you must be careful.
A guy like me?
Why? What kind of guy am I? A handicapped?
No, come on, Vincenzo, don't say that.
If I want to go out with a girl I will, without your full check-up.
But...
I have to protect you. I know it annoys you, love, but you need me.
No, you are the one who needs me,
I'm 20 and you still treat me like a child.
Mom, you've already done your part, you've actually done two,
because you've done that of Dad too and you've been wonderful.
But that's enough. You must live your life.
Your life is my life.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.
I'm going to say hi to Vincenzo. Will you cover for me tonight, too?
No, Cami, that's enough. You can't keep lying to Giorgio and stay with the psychologist all the time.
You can't keep lying to Giorgio and stay with the psychologist all the time.
Bea, I don't know what to do.
Ok, with Giorgio, we grew up together, but when I'm with Vinz...
I don't know, it's different.
Please, I swear to you that tomorrow I'll talk to both of them.
-You promise? -I promise.
-Are you ready? -Go, go.
Ouch.
So? Truth or Dare?
Um... Dare.
Give a kiss to...
-Furio. -No.
Yes!
-No, negative. -Come on!
No, guys, not Tommy!
Come on, a small kiss.
-Come on! -Do it!
Come on bro, it's a dare. Quick.
No, bro! No, no! Not with the tongue!
-No! -Just a bit...
Hey.
-Hi. -Hey.
Wait. Come closer.
-Can I do something? -Yes.
Would you like to see the world the way I see it?
Bro. Yes, yes, yes! Truth or Dare?
-Truth. -Truth...
Are you in love, bro?
-Tough, huh? -So, bro?
-Yes, I'm in love. -Who are you in love with, bro?
With whom?
Um... yes, I...
I love... -summer. -Go to hell!
-summer. -Go to hell!
-Marcolino, come on! -Oh, I love summer.
-No! -I know, but...
-Come on... -Blah.
Why not?
What the fuck are you doing?
Gio. Wait. Wait up!
-Hey! Let me explain. -Explain what?
You tell me you're home with Bea and you're kissing a guy on the beach instead?
-No, Gio, please, I swear-- -How many lies did you tell me?
I swear. Wait up! Let me fucking explain...
Hey. Hello. How are you?
If you're looking for your son, he's not here, it's early.
No. No, I wanted to apologize for the other night.
I was bad-mannered.
Okay, apologies accepted.
Forgive me, but I have to work.
Incoming call from Camilla.
I messed up, Vince'...
You're in good company, Mom.
I guess I still haven't understood anything about love.
But in my opinion...
if you're afraid of losing, you won't play well.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
What about you?
I mean... what's wrong with me?
I go out with a nice guy, we talk about nice things all night long,
then I go to the toilet, and when I get back I find him talking to another girl.
I know, I may not be Scarlett Johan--
What are you doing?
Sorry.
Do you want to know why...
he started talking to someone else?
Because I talked about you all evening.
-Do you know why I don't pay here? -Let's hear it.
Because I brought them all the most beautiful women of the Riviera.
Actresses, singers, models, beautiful...
Even a Miss. What is the name of that Miss...?
-Gorgeous, a goddess. -And you fucked her.
Well, I'm a gentleman, I don't say these things.
With her I used the despair method.
I said to her I was going to die, and she gave me this last gift.
You should use this method with Guenda.
You know, I can't stand your bullshit anymore.
Have you ever done something impulsive in your life, just because you wanted to?
If Guenda doesn't want you it's not my fault, you know?
Do you eat the prawn?
Look, you never paid here, but you never enjoyed a meal, and you know why?
Because you always thought about what would happen next,
about the fact that a girl was no different than the next one.
You don't fucking care if you have the woman of your life in front of you.
I know, but if you cancel the reservation I can't give you your money back.
Emma, what are you doing? Violante is my best friend.
So you were going to leave without telling me?
We fucked up, Ciro. It's better to end it here.
Wait up. You can't pretend that last night--
I was drunk last night.
I don't remember anything. And it is better if you forget it too.
Take this! Scopa.
Hi, Vi'.
Camilla has a boyfriend. Did you know?
So?
Yes, I knew it. But...
You were happy, I didn't want to ruin everything.
Look, I fucked up.
Yes, you fucked up, but now is worse.
Thank you for everything, Fu'. Thank you very much.
Sorry, do you know where the lifeguard is?
-Yes, he's over there. -Thank you.
Hey!
Vio.
My love.
-Oh well, I leave you to it. -No, come here, let's hug.
We'll catch up later.
-Okay. -Bye.
-Vio! What are you doing here? -Sweetie!
-Surprise! Aren't you happy? -Of course I'm happy!
-How long will you stay? -A week.
-Oh. -Ciro, I've missed you so much.
Come on, take the day off. Let's go to your B&B.
No, no, Vio. I can't.
-You can't? -No, I have the beach volley final.
The final is starting!
I remind you that the winners will get the tickets for the concert
and the losers will run naked!
Come on, my love!
-Where the fuck is Emma? -I think she's not coming.
You play.
-Me? -Yes, Furio, you see anybody else? Play.
-Come on! -Me.
-I'm fucking playing. I'm playing. -Come on! -I'm fucking playing! -Come on, come on!
Come on, come on, come on! Go, go!
No!
No, come on!
No, I know you. You want to appease me for when I come back to Milan,
You want to appease me for when I come back to Milan, but in the meantime you're fooling around in Ibiza?
How does it work? I...
Oh, you're in Milan?
You really think so?
I've missed you so much, too.
Pass it!
Guys, these are yours.
We are the best, guys!
Anyway, I'm going back to Milan, I'll take the nine o'clock train.
What? You go back to Milan? To see Bebo?
-Come on Gue', you know he's a douchebag. -Yes, I know.
But I can't stand being miserable here anymore.
But you were even more miserable with him. I mean, you were fighting every day.
I know that you are sad, but... Maybe there's a reason why it's over.
Well, I've already got the tickets. I'll go pack.
Fanny.
By the time I realized she was the woman of my life, it was too late.
I thought it was a waste being with just one girl when...
I thought it was a waste being with just one girl when... I could have a different one every day.
I was sure that I kept thinking about her because she was the most beautiful.
I had no idea I was in love with her.
Well, it was so long ago, it's ancient history.
But if you are still thinking about her, it means you're not over her yet.
-It's been 30 years. -It doesn't matter.
That's why it's incredible.
Years go by, but... she's always there.
I just didn't have the guts to realize it.
And you may be a loser,
but you are way braver than I am. You know?
Emma!
Emma, I know you are avoiding me, and I even know why.
-Viola, I... -Shut up and answer me.
Ciro has another girl, am I right?
Just tell me one thing... is it Mara?
No... No, there is no one else.
Fanny Beaumont, bro, it's her!
It's her.
Oh, she left him, bro.
Yeah, she was in a relationship, so she went back to her boyfriend in France.
Yes, but maybe it's not her, maybe it's another Fanny, I mean...
Now we'll find out. So...
Go.
So, this is not her.
Not this one.
I'll contact this one later. She's hot, you know?
Not this one, no, no...
-Yes. Yes. -There she is. Yes. It's her.
Yes. It's her. -Look how beautiful she is. -It's her, bro.
Gualtiero is not stupid, huh?
-Hello. -Thanks.
-Hey, who are you looking for? -Nobody.
Sorry! Is there the possibility to go backstage?
-Let's go, come on. -Thank you.
Vio! Vio, what are you doing?
Look, Ciro, you're not ready for a serious relationship.
You want something different. And maybe I want it, too.
No, come on, I too want to go backstage. What is this? No!
-Tommy! Please, eh? -No fucking way.
Anyway, bro, I would have done the same. I mean, I wouldn't have told you anything.
So you're not pissed at me anymore? No. Not anymore.
It's just that I imagined a lot of stuff and now I feel like a jerk.
Well, this is classic. Do you know how is it called?
This is carbonara indigestion.
Yes. What do you think I have to do now?
I mean, because she... I don't know, she told me a lot of bullshit,
but tomorrow I leave and I won't see her anymore.
Call her.
I've thrown the phone with her number in the sea.
What did you do? What did you think it was, the sofa?
-You're a jerk. -Come on, let's go find her.
- Let's go. - Hello, Vincenzo.
Who was it?
He's your mother's man, he's working security here, for the concert.
Really?
Can you do me a favor, then?
Mom! I'm calling you from a stranger's phone, I'm at the concert,
I'm calling you from a stranger's phone, I'm at the concert, I'm lost and I need you. Please come here!
-Let's go. -What a jerk...
Bro! I have the pass! I have a pass, bro. Let's go.
What?
Bro, I said you were about to die, so they took pity on you and let us pass.
Bro, I said you were about to die, so they took pity on you and let us pass. -Here we go. -Are you crazy?
-Here we go. -Are you crazy? Don't bust my balls! We have a pass! It's good, bro! Let's go, come on.
Don't bust my balls! We have a pass! It's good, bro! Let's go, come on.
Give me your hand.
No, no, over there.
-There she is. -Is she here?
There is Bea, too. She's with her boyfriend, fuck, I don't know if it's appropriate to show up here.
She's with her boyfriend, fuck, I don't know if it's appropriate to show up here.
No. What can we do?
Write her a letter, you know? Like old times. You speak, I write.
I don't care that the concert is sold out. Just let me in.
Security, we have a problem at entrance number two.
Why do you call security? I'm telling you I have a problem, let me in!
-If you don't want-- -Irene. -Lucio. -Don't worry, I know her.
Look, Vincenzo called me, he was in a panic, he's lost. I have to find him.
Really? I saw him leave with Furio. He seemed okay.
What? You've seen him leave with Furio?
-Sure. -So why--
Why did he make me come here, then?
I can't believe it.
I guess this time he was the one who took care of us.
No.
-What do we get? -It's for you.
-What do we get? -It's for you. It's urgent.
Who was that?
Hm? No one.
He was a... PR man, he was advertising a club.
Can you take me back to the hotel? Come on, bro, you can't miss the concert, it's your last night here.
Come on, bro, you can't miss the concert, it's your last night here.
I don't feel like celebrating, tonight.
I don't know why I'm writing to you,
you know I've never had a girlfriend,
you were my fisrt one.
But you just lied to me, you hurt me.
I should hate you now, but I can't.
You gave me the best moments of my life
and I love you anyway. Vincenzo.
BYE MARCO, I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO SAY GOODBYE... I'M GOING BACK TO MILAN,
BYE MARCO, I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO SAY GOODBYE... I'M GOING BACK TO MILAN, SEE YOU NEXT YEAR!
She's leaving.
BYE GUENDA
No, it's dumb... Bro, she is leaving, see what do you want to do.
Hm? That's enough, come on.
Where the fuck are you going?
Isn't Emma coming?
She has a double shift in the hotel not to see you.
Good evening! How are you?
-Are you having fun? -Yeah!
Today...
Today, for the first time, they told me that I am brave.
They also told me that I'm a bit of a loser, but I knew this, so...
I focused on the first part.
They told me that I am brave because I fell in love.
Because I wasn't afraid of this huge, giant thing, which in short...
Because I wasn't afraid of this huge, giant thing, which in short... ruins your life.
But that makes you do incredible things like the one I'm doing now.
So Guenda, it's true.
I'm a loser because I've loved you for five years
and I've never had the guts to tell you.
But I'm also brave, and so I'll tell you here, in front of everyone.
Doing what I do best...
which is make a fool of myself.
-Thank you. -Bravo!
Wonderful!
You're the man.
Please, don't say anything, okay?
They told me that I am brave because I fell in love.
Because I wasn't afraid of this huge, giant thing, which in short...
Because I wasn't afraid of this huge, giant thing, which in short... ruins your life. But that makes you do incredible things
ruins your life. But that makes you do incredible things like the one I'm doing now.
So Guenda, it's true.
I'm a loser because I've loved you for five years
and I've never had the guts to tell you.
But I'm also brave, and so I'll tell you here, in front of everyone.
Doing what I do best...
and you know it,
which is make a fool of myself.
Thank you.
Louder!
Gracias!
We broke up.
Hello?
Hello?
Fanny!
Fanny...
Listen... anyway...
with Gio it's over.
It was over months ago between us.
I swear, but when you are together since high school...
I don't know, it's hard to break up.
And I also wanted to tell you that... I'm not leaving for Canada anymore.
Look, Cami...
Until a few days ago I had no idea what love was,
I'd never dated a girl and I'd always just imagined all of these things.
But now, thanks to you, I've understood them.
But?
But you have to go.
I mean, this is your dream since you were 13 and I know it's far away,
I mean, this is your dream since you were 13 and I know it's far away, I know it's scary, but you have to go.
And I'm telling you even though being with you is the thing I'd want the most.
But do you promise that next summer we will meet here again?
I promise.
-You have to learn how to toke. -Loser.
Look at this...
-Bea! -Cami, come here!
-Bea! -Cami, come here! Hey, Vinz!
Guys, you have to promise.
Next year, you all come back here! - Yeah! - It's never gonna happen.
- Yeah! - It's never gonna happen.
-Whatever, though, didn't we have fun? -Yeah!
No, sorry, I can't do it. You remind me too much of my father.
Listen, I'm tired of this. Let me see a picture of your father.
Okay.
There's a slight resemblance... But how the fuck is it possible?
[woman 2] Good day, sir.
[man 1] Good day.
[woman 1] Next, please.
Everybody get down!
[man 2, in Afrikaans] Damn.
[in English] Don't be a hero. Stay down! Hey!
[man 2, in Afrikaans] Don't shoot.
-[in English] I said down. -[man 2] Don't shoot.
-[in English] I said down. -[man 2] Don't shoot. Move.
-[man 2 exclaims] -[man 1] Move, move. Down.
Where are you going? Down!
[man 3] Shit!
Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a bank robbery.
So you stay calm and you go home.
My name is Calvin Khumalo.
I was born in Mabopane, where running water is a luxury.
My comrades and I grew up in apartheid South Africa,
the most unequal society in the world.
We joined the liberation movement following the June 16 uprisings,
which left many of our peers dead.
With the majority of our leaders either imprisoned or in exile,
the youth have made it their responsibility
to put an end to this unethical system.
The main objective?
Make the country ungovernable.
The white minority regime has left us with only one option.
Violence.
Our orders from high command were simple.
Sabotage strategic key points in the capital,
with no civilian casualties.
That was the plan.
Comrades, Seahorse supplies oil to the South African Defense Force.
We take the oil.
You take the supply and power.
[Khumalo] We plant the explosives and hit as many fuel tanks as possible.
[Khumalo] There's no need for me to tell you that if we get caught,
there will be no prison time.
Only the rope.
The truck driver should be here any minute.
We get the signal from him and we move. Fast.
Gents, two minutes.
Terra! Hurry, man!
We don't have much time.
I can't hold it, man!
-Terra… -Mbali!
Get back in the car.
[in Zulu] Emergency, gentlemen. Jeez.
-[in English] He's late. -He shouldn't be.
-[in English] He's late. -He shouldn't be. [man 1] Can't we go on foot?
We need the truck driver for gate access.
Are you sure it's the right location? I mean, mistakes happen, huh?
Khumalo doesn't make mistakes.
[man 1] Okay.
These guys have been off the radar for so long,
but instead of fleeing, they come back to the capital,
one of the most protected cities in the whole damn country.
Uh, it makes no sense, man.
Makes perfect sense.
This is the arena.
It's the heart of their fight.
[radio] Now, time for the news.
An explosion at the Rooiwal Power Plant near Pretoria early yesterday morning
has left thousands of homes without electricity
and caused millions of rands worth of damage.
This is the latest in a series of sabotage acts by the terrorists
that have rocked large cities across South Africa…
Today it stops.
[radio] …causing speculation that a state of emergency might…
[in Zulu] Go! Go MK!
[radio in English] Anyone with information, contact Captain Langerman…
[Terra, in Zulu] Team MK. Go MK!
[radio in English] …in Pretoria on 012-555-2670.
[in Zulu] Where are you going now?
[in English] One's coming out.
Get ready! Get ready!
Move back! He is coming towards you. Move back!
Black woman, smoking in public…
[in Zulu] No way…
[in English] What now!
-[Khumalo] Get back inside. Let's go! -That's our guy!
[Terra] Let's move.
Are we doing this or what?
-That's not him. That's not our driver. -[Terra] What?
-[man 2] Who is he? -I don't know. Something's wrong.
-Something's not right. -I feel it.
I can feel it.
Get back inside.
Baker…
[radio in Zulu] Homeless.
[in English] Baker. I think he's gonna bolt.
Abort mission! Abort mission!
-[man 2] Move! -All units move in.
Hey! Come on!
[Langerman] I want them alive! Do not shoot!
Move, go!
-Masego! -[Khumalo] Get the guns!
Move! Move! Move!
-Masego! Masego, move! -[all] Go!
-[Khumalo] Move! Come on, go! -[Terra] Masego!
[Langerman] Everybody go! Go! Go!
-Move. -[Terra] Faster, man.
[Khumalo, in Zulu] This street!
[Terra] It's a gang, man.
[Khumalo, in English] Move.
Masego, can't this thing go faster? Move, man!
[Khumalo, in Zulu] Piss off! I'll kill you!
[driver, in Afrikaans] What now?
[in English] Keep moving.
Get this thing out of here! Come on! Get it out!
[laughs] I think we lost them.
-[in Zulu] Let's go! -[in English] Trying to kill us. Move!
Move!
[Masego] Who's this driver?
Taxi rank!
[in Zulu] You're driving right past it!
Reverse.
[in English] Come on!
[in Zulu] Go in, brother!
[in English] We got set up, man!
-Go, Masego! Let's move. -[Terra, in Zulu] Masego, no way man!
-[in English] Drive, Masego! -[Terra] Go!
[Khumalo] Comrades.
We lost Comrade Masego.
We have to go.
[in Zulu] Comrades, get moving. We need to find a way out.
[Terra] Masego?
[Terra] Masego! Wake up! What do you think you're doing?
Masego, don't do this to me!
Masego, I'm begging you.
[in English] Terra, Terra, we need to go.
No. Go, go, go. I'll stay with him. -Terra, we have to leave. -[in Zulu] Go. Quickly, go.
-Terra, we have to leave. -[in Zulu] Go. Quickly, go.
[in English] Terra… Mbali. We need to go. Mbali!
[Terra, in Zulu] Fuck you!
[Khumalo] Terra! We need to move!
[in English] Let's go. Go!
[man, in Afrikaans] I think it's Pieter!
Pieter, are you okay?
-[Langerman, in English] It's clear. -[man] He's still breathing.
[in Afrikaans] Hold on, buddy, hold on.
[in English] Pretoria Post.
It's the same van they used for the Rooiwal job.
[in Afrikaans] Hold on, they are on their way.
[in English] They left one behind.
[man, in Afrikaans] Men, search the building.
[in English] I want this whole building turned upside down!
They must be here somewhere, Malan!
[in Afrikaans] Go up there! Every car as well.
[Khumalo, in English] This way!
Dead end!
-[yells] Here, here! -[Khumalo, in Zulu] Let's get out of here!
[in English] Okay.
-[Khumalo] Come on! -[man] Move!
Go!
Move!
[man] Go, go, go!
[Khumalo, in Zulu] Press, Aldo, press!
[Aldo, in English] Make one line!
Go, go.
[officer, in Afrikaans] Get out of the way!
[Khumalo, in English] Move!
-[in Zulu] Let's go, guys! -[Aldo, in English] Go!
[Terra] Khumalo!
[Aldo] Calvin!
[gasps] My pump!
-Calvin, can you go on? -[gunfire]
[Terra, in Zulu] Let's go!
[Aldo, in English] Move!
-[gunshots] -[officer] Shots fired!
[Terra] Let's go!
[in Zulu] Go past! Go past!
Keep going! [in English] Move! Let's go!
Ah, shit! I'm out!
-[Terra, in Zulu] This way. -[Khumal, in English] Everybody move!
-Everybody! -[Terra] Let's go!
Move!
[Aldo] Calvin! Calvin!
Calvin!
[Khumalo] Aldo!
[Khumalo] Move!
[Khumalo] Come on, Aldo.
[Khumalo] That's it.
[in Zulu] Rabbi, get down! Down!
[Aldo] Move, clear!
-[in English] Move. -Move! Move!
[Khumalo] Everybody down!
Move! Let's go!
[Khumalo, in Zulu] Go past!
[in English] Everybody down!
Everybody down!
Go!
[Khumalo] Go back! Go back!
[Terra, in Zulu] What kind of shit is this?
[in English] We're trapped!
Oh my God!
[Khumalo] Move!
[in Zulu] Hurry, Ma. Go!
[in English] Move!
Hold your fire. I repeat, hold your fire!
Secure.
[woman] Next, please.
It's a bank.
[in Zulu] Gents, what are we going to do?
-[in English] This is bad. -Calm down.
Terra, your side. Move.
Aldo, your side.
-[man pops tongue] -Could you stop that?
It's rather disgusting.
Well, hello to you too, beautiful.
By the way, you are definitely in the wrong line.
No, actually…
I'm in the right line.
Name's Washington, Cornelius Washington.
Now that's cold.
[in Afrikaans] What you think you're doing, boy?
[in English] Excuse me? Um, who you calling a boy?
Don't play dumb with me. You're in the wrong line.
Whites only. Blacks that side.
Get your hands off me. I'm an American.
Is it?
Well, you're in Africa now, boy!
He's the American citizen that phoned in yesterday.
Damn Skippy. What? A man can't breathe?
[in Afrikaans] You didn't say he's Black.
[in English] Did I have to?
[in Afrikaans] Johan, let him go. Johan.
Don't even worry about it.
I'm from Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Hmm.
I deal with dumbass rednecks all the time.
Thanks for understanding.
All right, everybody, listen up.
This is now a hostage situation.
Nobody goes in this bank, nobody goes out.
We need a command post over there.
Schoeman, set up phone lines.
Good day, sir.
Good day.
[woman] Next, please.
Captain, they're already shooting at the hostages.
No, not yet. It's too soon.
Get me a bullhorn.
[Khumalo] Everybody down!
Don't play a hero.
[Aldo] Move!
[Khumalo] Stay down!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come here.
-Down! -[Johan] Don't shoot.
[Khumalo] Down, down, down!
Where are you going?
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is not a bank robbery.
So you stay calm and you go home.
Stay calm, go home.
[in Zulu] Hold fast!
[Terra, Aldo] Hold fast!
-[Aldo, in English] Move! -Okay, okay.
Hey, give.
Okay. Please don't shoot me. I have a two-year-old daughter.
And if you want to see her again, don't try any tricks.
-Okay. Sorry. -[Aldo] Move.
-Get up! -[hostages cry out]
Um… Please don't hurt me.
Money's in the vault. Just don't hurt anyone.
Take the money. Just don't hurt anyone.
Move.
-Okay. -[Khumalo] Now.
Hurry.
[woman] I could show you where the vault is.
This isn't a bank robbery.
Then what is it?
What's your name?
Christine. I'm the supervisor.
Christine the supervisor.
Is there a back way out?
No, only the front.
Move.
-Move! -[nervously] Okay. Okay, okay.
[Aldo] Get up!
[Khumalo] On the floor.
Not there, in there! Move.
[Aldo] Sit.
[Khumalo, in Zulu] What's this? Hello.
Looks like this one has issues.
[in English] That means you too.
-It's filthy. -[Terra mocks]
[in Sotho] Sit down!
Don't get on my nerves.
[in English] Move! Move, let's go.
[in Zulu] Ladies too. [in English] Let's go!
[Schoeman] Captain.
Captain. I think we might have something.
Yeah?
I'm not moving. I'm not going anywhere. Whatever…
-[Langerman] Who's she? -[Schoeman] Name's Jane.
She claims to be related to the bank supervisor.
A woman, white, by the name of Christine. She says she can help.
-What do you think? -I'm not moving…
Let's keep her close. We might need her later.
I can't go out like this.
Khensani's pregnant.
[in Zulu] I know.
[in English] Just get your mind off it.
Erasmus…
we've been betrayed.
Khumalo has a lot of explaining to do.
I don't know. Not Calvin.
[Terra] Then who?
[Aldo] Someone in high command sold us out.
I want answers.
And I want them now.
[man] Shit!
If anyone comes near those windows,
shoot them all!
Calvin Khumalo, Aldo Erasmus, Mbali Terra Mabunda.
We have the entire building surrounded.
[in Zulu] How's he know our names?
Never mind our names. How did he know about the mission?
[in English] Surrender your weapons and come out with your hands above your head.
-[in Zulu] Maybe the truck driver? -No. All the truck driver knew
was to meet us there and drive us in. That's it.
This guy knew everything.
[in English] Someone had to have told him.
[Langerman] I repeat, Calvin, we have the building surrounded.
[in Zulu] Don't look at me.
I lost Masego today. Don't piss me off.
There were other units on the Seahorse mission.
[Langerman, in English] Come out with your hands above your head.
What are we gonna do?
Get out.
[Langerman] Calvin Khumalo?
[in Afrikaans] I'm Captain Langerman. South African Police.
We met outside the bank.
[in English] English.
How do you know our names?
We've been tracking you for months.
We know you were behind the Rooiwal job.
You don't speak Afrikaans, yet you call yourself a South African?
Do you speak Zulu?
[Langerman] No.
Your people have been here 400 years
and you haven't bothered to learn an indigenous language,
yet you call yourself a South African?
Let's not get off on the wrong foot. Okay?
[Khumalo] Too late for that, Captain.
You've got to understand,
this is Pretoria.
By taking over this square
and this bank,
you're spitting in the face of the Afrikaner nation.
I don't give a damn about the Afrikaner nation.
They've taken apart my family, and they've taken apart many more.
My point is that it is going to be up to you and me to resolve this.
Peacefully and quickly.
Otherwise, it's going to end badly.
For everyone.
[Khumalo] Listen here…
This is what's going to happen.
Me and my comrades are going to walk out of here safely.
Unless you want us to start throwing bodies out the door.
[repeats] No.
Nobody needs to get hurt, Calvin.
I'll get you what you want.
I want a helicopter.
I want an unarmed pilot.
And I want safe passage to a location of our choosing,
which I will tell the pilot once we're airborne, no tricks.
Do you understand me?
Fine.
[Khumalo] Captain,
we have an American citizen in here.
He'll be traveling with us.
You have 20 minutes.
Get ready to move out.
Captain!
[Langerman] No. Not now. Not now.
[reporter] Captain.
You think this will work?
This is perfect.
With all due respect, Captain…
this could get messy very quickly.
But better it gets messy out here than in the bank.
Get me the helicopter. Let's get them outside.
Hey, brother.
You okay?
We're getting out of here.
Soon.
You are going back to Khensani.
Do you really believe that?
[Khumalo] After this, you'll be holding your newborn baby in your arms.
[Khumalo] Come on, Aldo.
I know today has been a rough day.
I know we lost Masego. But…
we've been through far worse situations.
And… -And Terra hasn't killed anyone yet. So… -[Aldo laughs]
we're going to be okay.
Let's go home, okay?
Let's go home. Let's go.
Ladies and gentlemen.
We would like to thank you for your kind cooperation.
And give our sincere apologies
for any inconvenience caused.
We did not intend to be here. But here we are.
Unfortunately, for me and my comrades to depart,
we are going to need
a volunteer.
Man, I'm Black, just like you. I ain't got nothing to do with this.
Oh.
So now you're Black.
You do make a valid point.
You are Black.
Just like me.
You. You'll be our American.
[Langerman] Targets are exiting the bank.
Nice and easy.
They're heading towards the helicopter.
Terra.
-How long you been in the police force? -I'm not.
This is a '64 Alouette, French-made,
used in the Matola Raid.
You know your stuff.
Matola Raid.
So don't try any tricks. Move.
[in Zulu] Let's go.
[in English] Targets are now entering the helicopter.
Copied, Captain. We're clear. We are clear.
Let's move it.
[Terra] Okay, let's go.
Something's wrong.
[Khumalo] Aldo, move in!
Calvin I… I don't…
[Khumalo] What are you doing?
Schoeman, what do you hear?
[Terra] Aldo, let's go!
Aldo, man. You have to trust me. Come, let's move!
-This is too easy. -Move.
Calvin!
[in Afrikaans] Shoot!
[in English] Hostage breaking away. Do not fire. I repeat, do not fire.
[Aldo, in English] Get up!
[Johan, in Afrikaans] Shoot!
-[Langerman] Do not fire. -[Terra] Get up!
[Khumalo, in Zulu] Come out of there, you dog. Come out!
Come on, dog. Move.
[in English] Back to the bank!
Everybody move!
The hostage in the white shirt is not American. He's a Boer.
-[Johan, in Afrikaans] Shoot! -[Langerman, in English] Do not fire.
[Khumalo] You messed up, Captain!
I see you, you messed up!
-[Langerman] What happened? -[Khumalo] You know!
Damn it!
[in Zulu] Move. Move, dog.
[in English] Move.
-[Khumalo] Move. -[Terra] Get back!
[Khumalo] Move.
[Terra, in Zulu] Sit down!
[Aldo, in English] Go.
You are alone now. Do you hear me?
-You are alone now. -[moaning] No.
-[Schoeman] No! -Schoeman?
We've lost the signal.
[in Afrikaans] We've lost the signal.
[in English] Huh? Triple seven. A Black white supremacist.
It's not what you think.
[in Zulu] You're a piece of crap.
[in English] Move! On the floor.
On the floor!
[Aldo] I knew they weren't gonna let us fly away.
Calvin. I'm… I'm sorry.
I should have listened.
You're sorry? You're sorry?
I'll show you sorry, son of a bitch.
I should have just killed you myself.
What about Masego?
-You selfish piece of shit! -Go to hell, Terra!
[Terra] You'll go to hell! I'll show you hell.
[Terra] You'll go to hell! I'll show you hell. Enough!
Terra, please. I understand, okay?
[in Zulu] He nearly had us killed.
[in English] We'd be dead if it wasn't for him, okay?
[in Pidgin] Please…
[in English] I'm bleeding here.
[in Zulu] Come here.
[in English] Get up!
[Khumalo] Terra!
[in Zulu] And now?
[Terra] Get in…
Let's go. [in English] Move!
-[pilot, in English] Okay. -[Terra, in Zulu] Let's go.
[in English] Big men with guns, huh?
But you're nothing but a bunch of terrorists.
[in Zulu] Get up.
[in English] Busy working for the white man? Get up, boy!
Who's the bloody informer?
On your bloody knees. On your bloody knees. Shit!
-Who is the bloody informer? -[pilot] I don't--
-[pilot gasping] -[in Zulu] Talk!
-I don't know. -[Terra] Lies!
[in English] Shit!
[in English] I don't know. I'm just a pilot.
Terra.
Because of people like him, Masego is dead.
Terra…
[in Zulu] Go cool off.
[in English] The police knew about the Seahorse Oil mission
because somebody told them.
See, the way I see it, you have two options.
Tell me nothing and die in this bank, or…
you tell me who the informant is
and you'll live.
I don't know.
I wasn't part of the operation.
Then why were you armed?
They put the gun in the helicopter so I could take you out
once you told us your location.
They would be waiting for you there…
in an ambush.
Brigadier's orders.
You have to realize one thing.
There's only one of two ways you're leaving this bank.
Prison
or death.
They found the wiretap.
Just when you think your day couldn't get any worse.
[Schoeman] Yeah.
[in Afrikaans] The Little Crocodile is here.
The Little Crocodile is here.
[in Afrikaans] Captain Langerman.
Brigadier.
The Big Crocodile is dying to see you. And he's on the warpath.
-Brigadier, we've been on this case-- -[Brigadier] I'm not talking to you.
What's that?
[Schoeman] It's a helicopter, Brigadier.
I know what it is, Schoeman.
But why is it standing there? In front of Uncle Paul?
Fix it.
Oh, and…
Have you seen the bank manifest?
The Justice Minister's daughter, Christine, is one of the hostages.
Really, sir?
Yes, Schoeman. Really.
That's why I'm here.
With all the horses, the dogs, the guns, the soldiers, and everything.
This crap stops now.
Do you understand me, Captain?
[Khumalo, in English] What's in that case?
What do you think?
Wait, hang on, man.
Why don't you say we make a deal, huh?
You want money?
All right.
Here you go.
Look, I don't want your money, okay?
Come on, man. Who doesn't want money, huh?
I'm a boxing promoter.
You know that big fight with John Tate and Gerrie Coetzee, huh?
Well, how about Nelson Mandela? You know Mandela, right?
He's a boxer.
Just let me go.
That's it.
It is?
-Hey! -[Cornelius] Whoa, easy.
[Terra] What is it?
I have a plan.
Hey, so we have a deal or what?
[Aldo] Just sit down!
Excuse me. When do we get to leave?
These people need food and water
and they need to relieve themselves, please.
[in Zulu] What's the plan?
-[in English] They're won't let us out. -I'm not surrendering.
[Khumalo] That's not what I'm saying.
Think about it.
They've been trying to kill us since the depot.
I know I've never let you guys down before, but…
but today, I have.
This could be our last mission.
But…
if our lives are worth nothing, then maybe…
Maybe we negotiate for a life that is worth everything.
Calvin.
Calvin!
Calvin!
This is the prime minister. He doesn't negotiate.
And we've tried this already.
[Terra, in Zulu] Khumalo. You're starting again.
[in English] Yes, we did.
For us. Okay?
But what if we turn this into a movement?
A movement? We need permission from high command.
In here we are high command.
No surrender.
No retreat.
[Langerman] Calvin?
I told you if you didn't comply with my demands,
there would be consequences.
What are you talking about? I complied, I delivered your helicopter.
Helicopter? Helicopter?
Hey, that wasn't a helicopter, that was a setup.
I don't want your helicopter, Captain.
How do you expect to get out of here?
You know what?
I don't.
Then what do you want?
Meet me at the door.
You've got to talk to me.
Tell me what it is you want.
[Khumalo] Freedom.
We want the immediate release of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela.
-[dramatic sting] -[Khumalo] All charges dropped.
We want a presidential pardon from the prime minister,
and we want it in writing, Captain.
[Langerman] Mandela?
You have one hour to get me a signed copy of that presidential pardon.
Then an hour after that, we want him released in full public view.
Then me and my comrades will surrender.
Calvin, that's a tall order.
A tall order?
Maybe you don't understand it.
Captain, what's the price of freedom?
[Langerman] I don't know.
[Khumalo] Everything.
One hour, Captain.
You think he'll do it?
[Khumalo, in Zulu] Let's not give them any other way.
[in English] This is gonna need some serious motivation.
NOW MORE THAN 1000 000 000 STRONGER.
Then let's give it to them.
[man, in Sotho] Dear Lord
We pray to you…
[in English] …to keep all of us, no matter what side, safe
and grant us safe passage out the bank.
So that Ernie can celebrate his daughter Karmen's second birthday.
We also pray for Amanda
and her unborn child, Simon.
For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory. Amen.
For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory. Amen. Amen.
[all] Amen.
[in Afrikaans] Thank you.
They want the release of Nelson Mandela.
In exchange, they'll release the hostages
and surrender.
Hey, what's wrong?
[whispers] Can't breathe.
Okay. Come on, Calvin. Here we go.
There we go.
It's gonna be okay?
I'm fine.
It's fine, let's move.
[in Sotho] My love.
[Christine, in English] Terra.
Your name is Terra, right?
What do you want?
Please, we have a pregnant woman here.
This is inhumane. You can't just keep us here all day.
What is wrong with you?
Do something about it.
Sit down.
Or else what?
[Terra, in Zulu] Didn't get that.
[in English] Were you saying something?
You darkies are all the same.
Nothing but criminals.
Johan.
Get up.
Get up.
Let me hear you say "darkie" one more time.
Say "darkie" one more time.
He didn't mean it.
Next time…
shut your mouth, okay?
[muffled] Okay.
Okay, look.
We are thirsty and we are starving.
And I have a flight to catch.
Ladies…
[in Zulu] Calm down, please.
[in English] We are working on it. Okay?
Okay.
[in Afrikaans] Dammit.
-[telephone ringing] -[in English] Go.
I hope you're calling me to tell me you have my letter.
Calvin, you know we're considering everything,
but these things take time.
The release of a man like Mandela isn't done at the snap of a finger.
Not good enough.
Hello?
Calvin!
[Aldo] What the hell are you doing?
[in Zulu] Khumalo, what are you doing?
Khumalo! Talk to me.
[Khumalo, in English] Get up.
[Cornelius] For what?
[Khumalo] Get up.
[Terra] Get up.
Man, I ain't come here for this.
This is bull, that's what it is.
Let's move.
-Man… -[Khumalo] Take this trolley.
-[Terra] Move. -Go.
[Khumalo, in Zulu] Aldo, machine gun.
[in English] Keep an eye on them.
[SWAT leader] Brigadier, they're coming out. The door's opening.
[Brigadier, in Afrikaans] Get ready.
[in English] Hold your fire. Hold your fire.
[in English] Hold your fire. Hold your fire. They're coming outside. This is progress.
Who's he?
-[Brigadier, in Afrikaans] Take them now. -No, wait, Brigadier,
-[Brigadier, in Afrikaans] Take them now. -No, wait, Brigadier, something's not right.
There they are, standing outside.
Shoot them.
[Langerman] No, one of those three isn't one of our suspects.
I didn't say he's one of our suspects. I gave you an order.
Shoot the bastards now.
Calvin is cunning as a jackal.
[in English] Take it!
[in Afrikaans] He wouldn't just expose himself like that.
I think that man might be a hostage.
[in English] Now pour it.
[in Afrikaans] Now you listen to me, Captain.
I gave you an order.
[in English] Brigadier, permission to engage? We have a clear shot.
Nobody fires unless I say so.
-Langerman… -[Langerman] Let me talk to him.
[Brigadier] Langerman!
Pour it!
What is this?
You're out of time, Captain.
Hurry. Now light it!
Light it!
Why are you doing this?
-What does it prove? -Light it.
Wait. Mr. Officer, hold on now.
I think there's a big misunderstanding.
-Hold on. Look-- -Light it!
I don't want no trouble. This has nothing to do with me.
-I ain't even from here. -You're home now, brother.
Don't shoot. It's the American.
That's right. I'm an American. I'm a boxing promoter.
I shouldn't even be here. Please, take me with you.
[Terra] Shut up!
Listen to me.
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Now light it!
Please. Light it.
[SWAT leader] Permission to shoot?
Free Nelson Mandela!
-Brigadier, I got the shot. -No!
Free Nelson Mandela!
[officer] Take him!
[Langerman] Nobody is shooting anything. We're still negotiating.
[Khumalo] Free Nelson Mandela!
They must free him.
-[crowd] Free Nelson Mandela, free him! -[Khumalo] Free Nelson Mandela!
[Khumalo] Free Nelson Mandela!
Free him!
Free Mandela!
Back in! Move!
Calvin, release some of the hostages.
Will be a sign of good faith.
Maybe you don't understand what I'm talking about.
The next thing I wanna hear from you is that you received that pardon.
If you don't, I'm burning more money and more money.
And when the money's out… [laughs]
Well, then… you know what happens.
Free Nelson Mandela. Free him!
[all in Zulu] Power to the people! Power to the people!
[in Afrikaans] You nearly caused an international incident.
That was an American hostage.
But he's Black!
I couldn't care less that he's American.
Shut them up!
Get rid of this damn disturbance. I do not want to hear them!
[crowd cheers in Zulu] Power to the people!
That was not cool, man.
I know y'all want freedom,
but freedom ain't free.
And I ain't gonna be the one to pay for it.
Then who must?
Who must?
Maybe you don't understand.
As long as one of us is in chains, none of us are free.
Save it, man.
[in Zulu] That bloody captain is a piece of shit.
I swear…
[in English] I don't care what Khumalo says, if I get a chance to avenge Masego,
I'm going to do it.
Captain Langerman will get what he deserves.
I guarantee it.
[pilot in Afrikaans] Excuse me.
[in English] I'm bleeding. I need the bathroom, please.
[in Zulu] Erasmus, please deal with this dog before I kill him.
-[in English] Get up. -[Christine] What happened?
I almost got shot. That's what happened.
They were talking about freeing Mandela.
-And they made me burn the money. -What?
I'm gonna go talk to him.
[in Afrikaans] Christine, you mad? What do you think you're doing?
[in English] You're not in this alone, Miss Fancy Pants. Coming with you.
-We need to talk to you. -About what?
We've asked for food and water. We haven't received any.
[Khumalo] It's on the way.
You know, from the moment you walked into this bank,
you messed up everyone's life, including your own.
I messed up everyone's life? Me?
I'm not the reason you're standing in a line you shouldn't be.
-Doesn't matter what line I stand in. -[Khumalo] It shouldn't.
But we live in a country where it does for people like us.
[scoffs] That's where you're wrong.
Me, you…
we're not the same.
I think we're more alike than you'd like to admit.
I know your type.
You think you're special, different from the rest.
But truly, you're not.
Does that remind you of anyone?
Maybe you're right. But that still doesn't change the fact
that what you're trying to do here is impossible.
You know, a man once said,
"It always seems impossible until it's done."
That's a wise man and those are beautiful words.
But what's your plan?
This is the plan!
To burn money?
How are you gonna get out of here?
The police consider Mandela to be the highest form of terrorist.
Burn all the money you want, they won't release him.
I don't have to explain myself to any of you.
Now go sit down, now!
Go!
And that wise man, that wise man who said that,
that's Nelson Mandela.
That's the man we're trying to free.
Go sit down.
[pilot] You know, it's only a matter of time before the police come in here.
When they do, they'll kill you and everyone else in here.
I don't wanna be caught in the crossfire.
[Aldo] Hey, tell someone who gives a shit, okay?
You ought to give a shit.
I ought to kill you myself if we don't start moving.
[in Zulu] Let's go.
[in English] The minute you start releasing hostages…
I want to be the first on that list.
And why would I do that?
Because if you don't, Aldo,
I'll tell your friends who the real informant is.
Don't forget about our agreement.
Remember, we know where your wife is.
[Aldo] You know what?
You're right.
Keep your friends…
close.
No one threatens my family.
Aldo!
Aldo.
Aldo, what happened?
He tried to kill me.
Okay, Aldo.
Up, Aldo. Aldo, up.
No one can find out about this.
If they do, they'll storm this bank.
Let's grab him.
[Khumalo] Get his legs.
You've got blood on your hands, Comrade.
Clean it off.
Hey, we want food and water.
I can do that for you, but I need a favor in return.
Two hostages.
Four.
[Khumalo] Two.
Okay.
But I need one of them to be Christine.
Why?
What's so special about her?
[Langerman] Nothing special.
The bank just wants their female supervisor out of there safely.
[whispers] Standard procedure.
Standard procedure.
Just bring that food and water.
[Khumalo] Food and water has arrived.
We're letting you go first.
[Aldo] Get up.
You're doing a good thing, son.
So, the police asked me to release you specifically, Christine.
Do you know why?
I have no idea.
Okay, well, you are free to go.
I'm not walking out those doors.
[in Afrikaans] What are you doing?
[in English] If she doesn't want to go, I'll take her place. Pass me my bag.
Sit down!
Christine, I suggest you go before I change my mind.
I'm not going to leave these people here.
They're my responsibility. I can't just abandon them.
You can take Susan in my place.
Come help me get the food.
Come out.
[in Afrikaans] See you later.
[Langerman, in English] Where's Christine?
-[in Afrikaans] Doesn't wanna come out. -[in English] Why not?
How am I supposed to know? Maybe she likes the ambiance in there.
I gave you two hostages, okay. We need that letter, Captain.
Move it. Hey!
[Schoeman] Where's Christine?
[Langerman] She won't come out of the bank.
[Khumalo] Damn.
Captain. What if we use that old lady over there?
[in Afrikaans] No.
How do you mean "No," Brigadier?
Because I say no.
We could use her to persuade Christine to come out of the bank.
Let me explain something to you both.
You want us to turn a maid
into a heroine on national television?
How desperate do you want us to look? Hmm?
Fuck.
Fuck.
Captain!
If your plan doesn't work, mine will.
[Aldo in English] Come! Bathroom break is over.
Uh, my… my shoelaces.
Hey.
-Hurry up. Don't have all day. -[Khumalo coughing]
-[Johan] Drop it! -Hey!
-Drop your guns! -Put it down.
I said drop the guns!
-Or else I'll kill him. I'll kill him. -Calm down.
I will! Drop it!
-[all shouting] -Put it down.
I will kill him!
-[all shouting] -Look! Look at me! I'm moving back.
I'm moving back. I'm putting it down.
-I will kill him! -Okay! Okay! Okay!
-[indistinct shouting] -Okay! Okay!
All right, I'm dropping it.
[Brigadier, in Afrikaans] Shots. Go!
[in English] Terra, wait.
It's a five shooter. You're out.
[in Zulu] Khumalo, shoot him, man!
[in English] The enemy's outside, not in here. No civilian casualties.
But if any of you guys try that again, there will be consequences.
Do you understand me? I told you, you stay calm, you go home.
This is not calm.
Terra, check on Aldo.
-Ernie. -[Ernie] Yeah.
[Khumalo] Come here.
Ernie, you just got a promotion. Go lock up your boss.
-Okay. -Chain him there.
[in Zulu] Get up, dog.
[in English] Stay calm!
On the floor.
[in Zulu] Terra, let me have a look…
I'm all right.
[in English] Excuse me.
What?
Is there any way we can help?
-I don't know. Do what you can. -[telephone ringing]
Calvin, we heard gunshots. What is happening in there?
[Khumalo] Nobody is hurt yet, Captain.
But that could all change.
You've run out of time.
Thirty minutes, I just need 30 more minutes.
You don't have 30 minutes.
You have 15 minutes.
Fifteen.
Fifteen.
[in Afrikaans] Not now, man.
[Khumalo, in English] Why didn't you leave?
You had every opportunity to go, but you didn't take it.
I'm just trying to help.
Sure, you are.
I'm sure.
Where is she?
[Khumalo] Step away from the door.
There's no way out.
This has nothing to do with me. So I demand to leave right now.
[Khumalo] You don't get to make demands.
What's stopping me from killing you right now?
What?
Like you did the pilot in the vault? Go ahead. Shoot me.
-Probably had white parents. -[exhales]
White friends, spoke English your whole life.
How do you even begin--
It doesn't matter.
My point is,
you can hide behind your history.
Maybe get away with it because of how you look.
Use your privilege…
and your money to keep up the façade.
But you can't run away from who you really are.
-You don't know me! -[dramatic sting]
You think it's easy being me, looking the way that I do?
People constantly sniggering and debating who I am.
You don't know me.
And you know nothing about the choices I've had to make.
Calvin.
You're right.
I don't know you.
The pilot was self-defense.
But if the police find out…
they'll storm the bank.
[Khumalo] Go join the others.
You know, all day I've been thinking who the informant could be.
And I just thought maybe Masego.
This makes me think… maybe Terra.
No…
Not Terra.
She's got a heart of gold.
Masego…
Let's move.
I'll do it.
Uh, Pastor Whatchamacallit…
No offense, but this ain't for you.
I beg to differ.
I want to help too, if you'd allow.
You can put the gun to my head if that'll help.
That doesn't seem necessary.
Do as I say and you'll be safe.
Why are you doing this again, Calvin?
Why? Why?!
What you've asked for is not easy to deliver.
-And you know it. -Maybe you don't understand!
-And you know it. -Maybe you don't understand! You have run out of time, Captain.
What's it gonna take? Huh?
You know what? I think I'm done burning money.
Maybe I should burn this building, this square,
or maybe Uncle Paul over there!
I will burn this whole country down if it takes it.
You will release him!
Why don't you give them what they want? Let sanity prevail!
[in Afrikaans] Pastor. [in English] I'm doing my best.
Try harder!
In order for this to work, I need Calvin to help me.
You are not a partner. You're not helping me.
You're gonna get someone killed.
Try harder and deliver on your promises.
Deliver!
-Ha! -[Schoeman] Captain! -Letter from the prime minister. -Calvin, wait!
-Wait! -[Schoeman] Captain!
Assuring the release of Mandela.
Calvin, wait. It's your letter.
It's a pardon and a statement of release.
Signed by the prime minister.
I'm gonna bring it to you.
They're going to do it, Calvin.
They're going to release Mandela.
This… This is just a letter.
Okay, well… when are you actually releasing him?
Few hours, I'm sure.
Calvin, wait. Wait. Listen to me.
In order for this to work,
I need to come inside and make sure that all hostages are okay.
-[scoffs] -Then they'll release him.
Please. That's how this works.
Okay, you decide.
Aldo!
Stay back, hey!
Just so you know, Captain. This?
Just so you know, Captain. This? This is just a letter.
You deliver.
You deliver!
Deliver!
[in Zulu] Dog. Ha!
[Terra] Khumalo, what does he want in here?
[in English] We're gonna release Mandela, Terra. It's okay.
You get my name out of your mouth. Hear me?
[in Zulu] Don't stress, Terra.
[in English] Hello.
I'm with the police force.
I've been asked to make sure everybody's okay.
We're working to get you out of here, okay?
Christine.
[in Afrikaans] People outside are worried about you.
Come with me, please.
No.
[in English] Okay.
Calvin, please. I need to take the girl.
It seems she feels safer in here than out there, Captain.
And I think you've seen everything you need to see.
Leave.
Wait.
Where is he?
Where's who?
The pilot, Sechaba Maselemola, where is he?
Know what, Captain? I think you've overstayed your welcome.
Leave now.
Wait.
Put your leg on the table.
[in Zulu] Terra, what are you doing?
[in English] The other one.
It's not what it looks like.
Khumalo, you see. He can't be trusted.
Get down.
[shouts] Get down on your knees.
So many lies.
Is anything you say true?
Does this check out?
-[Langerman] Yes. -[Khumalo] Does it?
Calvin, I am not lying to you.
-[Khumalo] For your sake! It better. -Please. Please.
Lower your weapons.
Calvin, no one needs to get hurt, please.
Okay, he's right. Okay, okay.
Let's all calm down. Okay?
Calm down. I'll put my gun down.
Aldo, you… you put your gun down.
Aldo, you… you put your gun down. Then, Terra? You put your gun down. Okay?
Terra.
Terra, I need you to put your gun down.
Terra.
Mbali!
Okay.
Captain.
I think you should leave now. Right now, go.
Captain Langerman.
That's your name, right?
[Langerman] Why?
[Terra] Your name is Langerman? Yes or no?
Yes, so?
So…
So…
Terra, how do you know his name?
I never told any of you his name, so how do you know it?
I don't.
But Aldo does.
He mentioned Langerman's name when none of us knew it.
Right, Aldo?
Captain Langerman will get what he deserves.
I guarantee it.
Right, Aldo?
Aldo, is this true?
[voice breaks] Is it true, Aldo? Did you…
They got to Khensani.
Terra, I'm sorry.
[Khumalo] Aldo!
Aldo!
No, Aldo…
Terra, what did you do?
They lied to you.
[in Zulu] I should shoot you in the head.
[in English] You lied to him.
And freeing Mandela?
This…
It's a lie too.
Just leave, okay, leave.
Leave now!
Get up.
Move.
Move!
[Khumalo] I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, Aldo.
I'm sorry.
Why didn't you tell us?
Why didn't you tell us?
[Brigadier in Afrikaans] I agree, Honorable Minister.
Yes.
Naturally.
I will make absolutely sure of it.
Thank you, Honorable Minister.
Langerman, Schoeman.
Get ready to breach.
What? What about the hostages?
-No longer important. -[Langerman] Brigadier…
One of them just died. They're vulnerable.
They could surrender, Brigadier.
[Langerman] We can find a peaceful solution.
You think that after what happened in there
that you can convince him?
When I was in the bank
I saw a man who wasn't prepared to pull the trigger.
He could have kept me hostage but he didn't. Why?
I think this whole situation, the violence, the murder
it's consuming him.
You want me to believe that damn terrorist in there
is a good man?
No.
What I'm saying
is that Calvin Khumalo
is fighting for justice.
And he doesn't want to lose more people.
And that's
your problem.
You think that trash in there
are people.
Out!
[Christine in English] I have an idea…
What do you want?
I don't have anything for you.
I have police outside. I've got hostages in there.
So what do you want?
I just want a moment alone.
When I was eight my mother died.
And a month or so after her death, Jane came into my life.
Who's Jane? Who the hell's Jane? I don't… Can you leave?
Please just leave!
She was my nanny, but so much more than that.
Listen to me.
Okay, she taught me about love for all and equality.
She said that ubuntu is our duty.
What do your people know about ubuntu?
What do you know about humanity?
[in Zulu] We are only human through other human beings.
We are only human through other human beings.
[in English] They're just words, Christine.
The Minister of Justice.
He… He's my--
He's your father.
That's why they wanted you out. [laughs]
I once witnessed my father take another man's life.
Killed him like it was nothing.
And for what?
Because he was Black?
So what?
So what, Christine? Huh?
He got killed because he was Black. We get killed because we are Black.
We're kept poor because we are Black.
Because I'm Black I'm here.
So what?
There's no pain in your privilege.
My father and the people who work for him,
they represent everything that I don't want to become.
And that's why I'm going to help you.
How?
[Langerman] What's going on, Calvin?
What is this all about?
She has something to say. So listen.
Captain, these men are not criminals.
They didn't come here for the money.
They came to send a message.
That all they want is freedom.
What's wrong with that?
[in Afrikaans] Think of your family.
Of your father. Please.
Father.
Please, Father, I implore you.
I know you can see me.
Do what they ask. Please.
Do the right thing.
[Jane] Christina!
No! What are you doing?
Don't touch me, you fool.
Free him!
-[Khumalo] Free him! -[Christine] Free Mandela! Free him!
Free Nelson Mandela!
Cease fire.
[in Afrikaans] Officers, come and fetch this woman.
[Langerman, in English] Cease fire!
Where did that shot come from?
Go! Find him.
[Brigadier in Afrikaans] Stand down.
Stand down.
-[Khumalo, in English] Christine. -[hostage sobbing]
[Khumalo] Get me some towels. Please, hurry.
It's okay. Hey!
-You were brave, okay? -[gurgles]
Come on, Christine. Christine.
-She's gonna be okay. -[shushes]
[Ernie sobs] Come on, Christine. Come on.
It's okay.
[Khumalo] It's okay, Ernie.
It's okay, Ernie.
Captain. The sniper.
Who told you to fire?
I thought I saw a threat.
A threat? A white woman, a threat?
You shot the Minister of Justice's daughter in public.
This is going to cost you your career.
[in Afrikaans] It's a matter of national security.
Come with me.
[in N. Sotho] I'm tired.
I know.
I know, I know.
[in Afrikaans] Don't let them worry you.
You did the right thing.
We'll look after you, soldier.
[sniper, in English] Thank you.
[in Afrikaans] Dismissed.
[in English] That's the only picture that I've ever kept.
Our home was a safe house in Mabopane.
I grew up seeing strangers walking in and out of my house
disguised in makeup. Police raids…
And when I was a little boy,
I watched the police
gun down my parents.
I watched my parents on their knees
begging for their lives.
[sighs] I made a promise to myself.
That I wouldn't stop until I avenged them.
And that choice…
That choice brought me to the MK.
To the liberation movement.
It brought me here.
So, I actually lived in Mamelodi with my mother.
She was doing pretty well for herself until she had me.
Then everything changed.
Kids never wanted to play with me.
Their parents demonized me.
They never accepted me.
So…
she gave me up for adoption to her employers.
The Page family.
They loved me.
They cared for me.
But they never understood me.
They never understood my Blackness.
Nobody ever has.
[in Zulu] Khumalo, you have a phone call.
[Langerman, in English] Calvin, are you there?
Yes.
[Langerman] The brigadier is sending in the SWAT team. It's out of my control.
Hostages could die, Calvin.
Calvin? Hello?
That's the prime minister's office.
They're releasing Nelson Mandela.
You're all free to go.
[in Sotho] Thank you.
[in English] Your freedom…
costs too much.
More than you'll ever know.
[Langerman] No.
[in Afrikaans] Langerman, go home.
Spend some time with your wife.
That's an order.
-[helicopter droning] -Because you are now done.
[in English] What's the price of freedom?
I don't know.
Everything.
-[Brigadier, in Afrikaans] Move in. -[officer, in English] Move in!
[officer] Khumalo!
[Terra, in Zulu] We kill dogs!
[Terra] Fuck you!
[Khumalo, in English] Come on, Terra!
[Terra, in Zulu] This will be easy!
[Khumalo] Terra, come this side!
Bastards!
We showed them.
We showed those dogs.
-We made them dance. -Yeah.
You know those dogs got me.
This is just a graze.
[in English] Calvin Khumalo, come out.
With your hands on your head, now.
This is your last chance.
For us.
[Brigadier] This is your last chance!
One more time.
[in Zulu] Hold fast.
Hold fast.
[in Afrikaans] Damn it.
Get ready to breach again.
Bianca!
Don't be silly. Let me down.
Come on! Hurry up.
All right, over here.
No! Ciccio, don't be silly!
Wait.
-Bianca, come on. Let's go. It's late. -Ciccio!
Let me down!
Bianca, come on!
-Here we are! -Come on. It's late.
Bianca.
Turn around.
Will I see you tonight?
At the house near the cemetery.
Next to the fountain.
Jesus Christ. What's wrong with you? Come on.
-Yes, what's wrong with you? -Come on. Let's go.
-Hey, not a word. -You're a devil.
-Bye. -Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Rocco, what are you doing?
Always eating this rubbish!
Go!
-Want to help Grandma? -Yes.
-Can you do it? -Yes.
Look. Just like this.
We make it long first and then thin. Try.
These are bad for you.
How many times do I have to tell you? How many?
Leave him alone. Nobody's ever died from them.
This is what you should eat. Understand?
Here.
What time did Ciccio come back last night?
Listen, I said no. I'm not coming into town with you today.
I'll go by myself, then.
Bianca, you're playing with fire.
Ciccio's married and has kids. Do you understand?
Cosimo, we need water here!
-Everyone knows it. -Give me an olive.
These are really good!
You can stop now. Food's here. Stop!
Come and eat!
Come on. Let's have this sandwich.
They need water, Cosimo.
Just a bit of cheese, please.
-How are these sandwiches? -Good.
Enjoy them.
Well done.
Cosimo.
Are you all right?
You've been in the sun too long.
Go inside the barn.
You're done for today.
Go on.
-Won't you even stop to say hi? -Linda.
You have no time for me, but you do for Schettino's daughter.
-Everyone knows in the village. -Be a good girl. Go home.
Daddy!
Rocchino!
-So, did you see what I brought? -Yes.
You like it? What shall we call her?
She's black.
She's black. Let's call her Blackie.
-Okay? -Yes.
Take the rope. Take it.
Let's put her here.
That's good. Let's tie her here. Where's mom?
-I don't know. -What do you mean, you don't know?
Hey! You little rascal!
-Do you love Daddy? -Yes.
Good boy.
Keep an eye on her. Okay?
Luci!
Lucia?
I fell asleep…
You've really taken after my father, you know?
When you were little, he used to hold you and say,
"Nine, he's not even two, and listen to how he talks!"
"He'll be able to do whatever he wants in life."
But now…
What's wrong with this head of yours? What's wrong?
Stop it!
Have you ever thought about leaving this place, Mom?
To go live somewhere else…
with different people speaking a different language.
No.
I'm happy here
with my children.
Antonio didn't write this month.
Has he forgotten about us?
Antonio?
Antonio will always be there. He thinks about us every month.
I want to leave this place.
You have such beautiful hair.
What are you wearing underneath? Show me.
-Show me what's under your shirt. -No.
-Please. No. -Show me.
No?
Go on. Turn around! Open your legs.
-Maria. -Hey, Ciccio.
-Where's your husband? -He's still in town with the girls.
He's still in town? Did you make coffee?
I just made it. Take a seat.
Thanks.
It's good. Better than the Rodolfo Cafe's.
What idea did you put in my husband's head?
You know all too well what happens to those who oppose the mayor.
-Are you scared? -I have two daughters. Do you understand?
-You want them to live in this shit? -I don't want to raise them by myself!
Next.
Name.
Domenico Stigliano.
-How many olives do you have? -Two tomoli.
Two? Well done!
There you go.
Is that it, sir?
This money won't even last me three months.
I have two children. I've worked the land for a whole year.
Do you think this is easy?
It's not easy.
There are taxes to be paid to the government.
And who pays them? You?
Do you pay them?
I pay them! Get that into your head!
Here.
And that's it.
You can go now.
Next.
-Name. -Ciccio Paradiso.
What the fuck is he doing?
This year, olives are 2,000 lire per 100 kg.
And who will buy them?
I will.
Ciccio,
I have three lovely tomoli near the river.
I'll have two more ready in a week.
I'll buy them.
No more easy money!
Enough of these out-of-towners sucking our blood!
This year, the oil will be paid for and not given away.
Hey! What's with the long faces? The next round is on me!
No sleeping tonight!
Yeah!
Ciccio!
Ciccio!
Hoe the soil!
Let's make a toast!
-Hi. -Hi.
Hi, Mom.
Did you hear what happened?
Mario wanted to set himself on fire. Do you know why?
His 13-year-old son, Pinuccio, died while he was working.
The police pretend nothing happened.
We're sitting here eating…
I don't want to hear this talk in my house.
Do you know how much those bastards Buccella, Cataldo, Schettino pay per day?
400 shitty lire! 400 lire, Dad! One liter of milk is 100 lire!
Mind your family's business, not other people's shit!
Hey! Please.
Maria, the bread.
Where were you last night?
Lucia, please.
Why don't you answer your wife?
You really don't like this house anymore, do you?
You're just like your grandfather.
-Whose legs were you between last night? -All right.
Do these women have honey between their legs?
Lucia, please.
Go on then.
Go to your whores! Go!
-Look. -What is it?
Where did you get that?
This…
My aunt
helped an American soldier
who was sick.
And he left this to her.
What's he saying?
Who knows? It's French.
It's beautiful though.
It's wonderful.
We should travel.
Meet new people.
We can't die here.
Let's go to Paris.
And maybe we can even learn French.
So we can understand what this beautiful song says.
You're so beautiful.
Every time I see you,
it's like my head's on fire. I don't understand anything anymore.
My hands sweat and my legs shake.
Bianca.
For the respect that I show you, my friend,
you have to talk to this bastard.
You have to!
You have to make him shit his pants! He has to understand who's in charge!
You own 50 hectares of wheat and olives! Fifty!
So you are the boss, right?
You are!
Not him!
I pay 2,000 lire per 100 kg only to you and nobody else!
So you need to talk to him.
You have to bring him here, and he has to apologize to me.
Don Luigi, you have my word.
I will talk to Ciccio, but…
if he's taken after his father, it's going to be hard.
-Let me try. And I'll let you know. -Thanks.
I have a demijohn of good oil for you. My son's got it ready downstairs.
You're always so kind. Thanks.
-I owe you, Don Luigi. -Thank you.
Tonight, I want the Gentile family here,
the Varasanos, the Donadios, the Moranos, the Pellittas and the Pastores.
I want them all here tonight.
I'll take care of Ciccio.
-Hi, Vincenzo. -I'll see you later. Bye.
Cosimo Schettino inside the church?
It must be a miracle. Is he going to take the vows?
You're playing with fire.
If Schettino knows you're seeing Bianca, you'll have two options.
You either marry her, or you marry her.
And I think you're married already.
Leave it alone.
You've got lots of women.
Vince, she's not just a woman.
When she laughs at night, she makes the sun come out.
But you can't understand. Nobody can.
Ciccio…
-Let's go get a beer. -Ci.
-Ci. -Let's go.
You're such a dickhead!
Get off me! Always fucking around.
Ciccio, wait.
Tonino.
Schettino wants to talk to you. He says it's important.
Calm down. We'll go in together. And we'll show him.
Will you calm down?
-No, we'll go in together! -I don't give a shit!
-I've had enough! -Stop it.
We'll beat the shit out of him!
-Stop it. Get lost! -Enough, Ciccio!
Listen, Vincenzo. Let me do the talking. I'll handle it.
May I?
Come on in. Cosimo, get him a chair.
A nice glass of wine. What do you say?
Bianca, bring some wine.
Do you know my daughter, Bianca?
No.
Cheers.
Cheers.
How's your family?
Your wife's name is Lucia, right?
Wait. And your son is…
-Rocchino. -Rocchino. Are they good?
Good. Thanks.
Do you know how long I've known your family?
When we were young, your father and I were like brothers.
Even more than that.
Your grandfather was my godfather. Did you know?
Then he met a girl and went to America.
And he left your grandmother with three children.
Do you know how old the girl was? She was 16.
Your grandfather was 55!
No, thank you.
So,
what's this story about the olives?
You know better than me.
Yes, but Don Luigi told me
that the other night, at Palladino's tavern, you…
Yeah, right.
He built his fortune on the shoulders of the poor people.
The families sweat blood on the land for a whole year.
Then he comes, and without doing shit, he earns three times as much.
Mr. Schettino,
I'm like my father.
Nobody has ever bent me.
And if someone wants to wage war against me,
it'll be a mess.
Tell your friend.
We hoe the soil.
We make the price.
You're right.
Well said.
You've got balls, kid. That's for sure.
Just like your father.
You can't help it.
Blood is blood.
All right.
Go now. I have things to do.
Cosimo, show him out.
Thanks for coming.
How did it go?
Good evening, Don Luigi.
Could you give me a ride into town?
What do you want? For heaven's sake, what do you want?
They're all asleep in heaven now.
I get it. Do you want money?
Help!
He's crawling. He crawls like a pig.
Piece of shit!
Fifteen thousand lire.
Piece of shit.
Enough, Domenico. Enough!
Let's go.
You're my flower.
Hi.
Are you crazy?
-Come. -Ciccio, what are you doing?
-Let's go to the barn. -No, I can't.
Ciccio.
Come here.
If my father finds out, it'll be a mess.
Sooner or later, he will find out.
Bianca.
Bianca.
When I'm with you, it's like…
It's like time stops.
And I hear music.
Bianca.
I want to always be with you.
But don't you love Lucia?
Yes.
But you're a different thing.
Something that doesn't exist here.
There are lots of olives this year.
They won't be able to pick them all.
We can't just throw money away.
We spent the night together,
the whole night.
In the barn? You're out of your mind.
You'll end up a nun.
Go into town and see if anyone wants to work for us.
When did he leave?
I don't know. It was morning, and I left first.
I'm going to get some hay.
One of the horses is limping.
We need to shoe it again.
Cosimo, I'll go with you.
-Did you hear that? -No.
What is it?
It must be a fox.
But I--
Cosimo, I can't hear--
-It's probably just an animal-- -Maria!
Wait, Cosimo! You…
You go and get the hay for Dad, or he'll be mad.
-We need to close this up. -The food will be ready soon.
I'm going in.
Ciccio?
Ci!
Holy mother of God!
Do what I say.
-Has he gone? -Yes, he's gone.
Listen, get out of the window, quick.
-Bye, Maria. -Hurry up!
Mr. Schettino, I respect you,
but Don Luigi's been sucking our children's blood forever.
Are you talking to me about respect?
When your wife was sick, who helped you?
You did.
When you needed something, whose door did you knock on?
Yours.
This is respect.
Not what you talk about.
But waging war won't help anyone.
And we want to live in peace.
Lucia.
Rocchino, get off there.
What are you doing?
Where did you find these?
Come here.
Go home, now!
Go home. Go.
When I woke up this morning,
he wasn't in his bed.
I thought I was going to die.
Giustino found him.
He was looking for you.
Let's go outside. Father Felice's here.
I don't come here to confess. There's no need.
I have committed no sins.
I come here to understand.
There's nothing to understand, Lucia.
I do love you.
But you want one thing and I want another.
For you, it's a sin. For me, it's not.
Bianca, wait.
Wait.
Bianca?
Bianca, wait.
Bianca?
Don't be silly, Bianca.
Bianca.
That's dangerous. Come down.
Come on. Please, come down.
Did you see how my dad was looking at us?
Yes, I did. Come down, now.
I think he knows.
Hey, will you come down?
Bianca.
That's dangerous. Come down.
All right, then.
I'll buy you a long dress, down to your feet.
And you'll look like a queen.
-Red. -Yes, red.
And I want a ring too.
Close your eyes.
We're leaving in three days.
Don't tell lies.
And be careful what you wish for.
Read this.
In the morning, I'll give it to your dad.
We'll go to my brother Antonio.
So?
She was with Ciccio.
Tell Maria to bring me the white shirt.
Maria, where is your sister?
She's at Auntie Carmela's. She went to get some flour.
What a good daughter I have.
She went to Auntie Carmela to get some flour.
I raised you properly.
Bianca.
Come here.
How's Auntie Carmela?
She says you never visit her.
Whore.
I'm not short of anything in this house.
I have a liar…
and a whore.
Why that face?
What is it? Don't you like it?
But when you make 15-year-old girls take off their clothes in the barn…
you like that.
Hey.
Let's go.
I've brought you this.
I've had it for a week.
But I can't read, son.
It'll take me a day.
I'll read it for you, then.
I want to show you something. Come.
We haven't had a year like this since before the war.
This is a rich land.
It only needs water.
And thank God…
we've got plenty of water here.
In spite of all the heat we've had…
the soil is still moist.
Yes, it's moist.
It's moist underneath.
It's moist!
I did warn you…
more than once.
You won't say another word now.
Not another word.
No!
No, Lucia!
-Don't look! -No!
No!
No, I beg you, no!
My Lord!
You are not my father anymore!
You are no one!
The thought of sharing the same blood as you makes me sick!
Ciccio!
Antonio, the manager wants to talk to you.
-Go ahead. -Thank you.
-Come in, Antonio. -Sir.
Good morning.
-Hey. -Hey, Antonio.
Dad invited us over for dinner tonight.
Good.
What is it?
Antonio, what's wrong?
My brother…
My brother died.
They killed him.
Who is it?
I don't know.
One second!
Police, open up!
The police? What do they want at this time?
-Come on. Let's go. -What happened?
I haven't done anything. What do you want?
Antonio!
-Mom. -Antonio.
Can you believe it?
Ciccio is gone.
Ciccio is gone.
Our Ciccio is gone.
He's gone.
Antonio.
Hey!
It's horrible.
Did you hear? They killed our Ciccio like an animal.
Antonio, I don't want to be here anymore.
I'll do whatever you want. I won't bother you.
If you have a friend, anyone you say, I'll marry him.
What are you saying?
-Lucia. -Antonio.
Thanks, Antonio.
Thanks for coming.
Here.
Give this to Father Felice.
Tell him that he has to do a special service for our Ciccio.
-Understand? -Yes.
Lucia, let's go.
We're going to get some flowers and some candles.
We'll be back soon.
For God's sake, where are you going?
To see Ciccio.
Bianca.
I swear if you come any closer, I'll rip your belly open!
No, Antonio.
We'll carry Ciccio.
Linda, come here.
You too.
Come on.
My condolences.
You can't score a goal!
Shoot. I will save it.
-No! -Goal!
I scored a goal.
Terrible!
-Nice! -Wait!
Wait!
The night before, your brother was here at the station
for the assault on Don Luigi.
After that, they saw him going home alone.
That's all we know for now.
In the North, it's bad luck to kill a spider.
You're not from here, right?
Listen, I ask the questions here, if you don't mind.
Then maybe you should be asking someone else, don't you think?
We do our job.
As soon as we get some news, we'll be sure to inform your family. Don't worry.
we'll be sure to inform your family. Don't worry.
Have a good day.
-Antonio hasn't got shit to do with it! -He's his brother!
My brother, Pasquale Morano, is in jail because of Ciccio!
-Do you understand? -Enough!
Thirty! Thirty men have ended up just like him! Do you hear me?
He's got it. Enough now!
-Get off me! -He's got it. Enough now! Go!
"Paradiso" family? It's a shit family!
Get lost!
Go!
Who's that?
One of the women carrying Ciccio's coffin was his wife, Rosina.
He once found her with Ciccio in a barn.
Some shit went down. You can't even imagine.
Antonio, your brother liked to sleep around a lot.
What about Bianca?
Do you know how many times I told Ciccio?
"Forget it!"
Nothing.
He'd lost his mind.
He wasn't thinking straight.
Like Ciccio used to say,
"Bianca is not a woman."
"She's a goddess."
All right, then. How did it go with the sergeant?
Fine. It went fine.
Thanks, Vincenzo.
And so?
They killed your son, and you don't say a word or do anything?
Ciccio made a mistake.
If you make a mistake, you pay.
Even if it's my son.
Ciccio was disruptive.
He gave people hope.
There's nothing worse than to give hope to people like us who have nothing.
It does more harm than good.
To wage war on those criminals, Antonio,
you must be like them.
Ciccio wasn't like that.
I'm leaving tonight.
By coach.
Antonio.
Forget about this house, these people, us, everything.
Don't ever come back here.
Don't touch me!
-Don't touch me! -Shut up!
-I'd like to talk to your father. -He's sleeping.
What is it? Is he sorry for what happened to my brother?
I said he's sleeping.
Besides, the Paradiso family isn't welcome in this house.
We don't like your smell.
Do you know why?
Because it's not a smell. It's a stench.
You stink like those filthy people who don't know their place.
By saying this, you make me wonder.
You can think what you want.
I'm not afraid of people like you.
The whole town knows the truth. Even the rocks.
Really? Everybody knows in town?
It's better this way.
Everybody has to know.
Your brother stuck his nose where he shouldn't have.
Nobody can come to my house to bother my daughter.
I raised her so that not even flies could buzz around her.
I feel sorry for your father.
But this is the end your brother deserved.
Remember, kid,
if you sow thorns,
you can't walk barefoot.
You take it out on these people who've always accepted their misery.
Resigned to be crushed by people like you, eaten alive by greed.
You should learn to enjoy your people's happiness.
Not their misery.
This land is rich enough to feed everyone.
But unfortunately, you can't understand this.
You think you have power,
but you're wrong.
They have it.
And as long as people like my brother die…
freedom will never die.
-The law should-- -The law!
I hold the law here, in my hands.
Now leave, and say hi to your father.
Before he loses two sons,
not just one.
Cosimo, shut the door.
And come inside.
Be a good boy, okay?
Antonio, take him with you.
Away from this place.
Before he becomes like us.
Lucia…
Don't cry.
Bye, Mom.
Thank you, Vincenzo.
POLICE
Maria!
Maria!
They killed Cosimo as well.
Good morning.
Can I have ten kilos of flour, please?
Sorry, there's none left. We're out of flour.
You're sorry?
And what's this?
This is not for you.
You had no flour last time either. What is it? Is our money no good?
You're out of flour. You're out of sugar. You're out of salt.
Do you want to starve us to death?
Come on, let's go.
Bianca!
What are you doing?
May I?
Come in.
Come on in! It's been so long! Come here. Have a seat.
Have a seat! Come here, darling. Come.
You know how many times I wanted to come to the farmhouse?
But since your father's gone, I spend all my time in Matera.
My office is there now. And I rarely come here into town.
You have a beautiful house.
The sacrifices…
Years of sacrifices.
But tell me, to what do I owe this visit of yours?
Do you need help?
Just say it.
I owe it to your dear late father.
Don Luigi, the land we own is huge.
After what happened,
nobody wants to work for us anymore.
Hey, Caterina.
Thank you. Leave it here.
Here it is.
Try this.
-It's really good. -No, thanks.
Don't worry.
We'll take care of everything.
You and your sister shouldn't worry. I'll send you one of my teams.
You've grown so much.
You've become beautiful.
You and your sister were so little.
How old are you now?
So, you'll send someone over?
Thank you so much.
Consider it done.
I was thinking…
I'm going to Matera…
Why don't you come with me?
If you're a good girl,
you can rest easy for the rest of your life. Come here.
Caterina!
-Are you okay? -Can you give me a hand, please?
Wait. I'll help you. On you go. Go.
-He needs to get to a hospital! -Come on! Hurry up!
Slowly!
God, it burns so much!
Did you see what the snake looked like?
It was big and black.
Vincenzo, it was big and black.
Well, then…
there's nothing to do but wait.
Wait? Wait for what?
My grandma used to say that when a snake bites you,
there are two options.
Well, you either pour a woman's milk on it…
Have you got milk?
Me? What's he talking about?
Or you can suck the poison and spit it out.
That's disgusting.
I know, but…
Come on, make up your mind. Me or him?
You.
Vincenzo, hold this a second.
Can you please look the other way? You too, Vincenzo. Turn around.
Wait. Don't move.
What's your name?
Bianca.
Bianca.
Bianca, wait. Let me…
Here we go. Close your eyes.
-Why do I-- -You have to, or it won't work.
-It's here, right? -Yes.
Hold on. I need to find a comfortable position.
You damn rogue!
You're okay. It was a four-lined snake. It's not poisonous.
Hey, I saved your life, you know?
Don't forget that.
You're with me every day.
Always.
Antonio!
Hey.
Look at me!
-How do I look? -You're gorgeous.
Come. I want to show you something.
The apartment on the second floor.
It's great.
Dad said that if we like it, we can move in in less than a month.
Good.
That's what we wanted, right?
Yes.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Antonio, is everything okay?
Yes, everything's fine.
Dad said that you didn't go to the last factory meeting.
-I know. -It's not like you.
I know. It's just…
-It's just what? -I couldn't make it.
What's going on?
You won't look at me or talk to me.
What's going on? Tell me.
Nothing's going on.
I'm just a little shaken. I lost my brother, and I can't…
That's it.
Over the years, Antonio, you've become an important figure here.
For everyone.
Thank you.
We've known each other for over 20 years.
If you need anything, to go away for a while…
Just ask.
We would be happy to help you.
Sir, I'm fine.
-It was just an accident. -Don't worry about that.
We'll sort that out.
I'm worried about you, Antonio.
I mean it.
I can keep working. I am fine.
-Are you sure? -Yes.
Fine.
-I can assure you. -Okay.
Thank you.
Antonio.
Yes?
My daughter really cares about you.
You have become part of our family.
Be good to her.
Thank you.
ANTONIO PARADISO VIA ENRICO TOTI - TRIESTE
See what I mean, Lorenzo?
-Who's there? -The usual. Shall we go in?
Let's go in.
-That's enough. -And seven!
Hi, what's up, Antonio?
-What's up? -How's it going?
All good.
-The usual beer? -Yes, thank you, Michele.
Totò, are you playing or what?
I'm not playing. Lorenzo will take my place.
Good! I might finally win tonight!
Who's going to win tonight? Come on. Show me how you win…
-Good morning. -Good morning.
Want some?
No, thanks.
-Are you going into town? -Yes.
Put your suitcase there. Go on.
Thanks.
You're not from here, right? You're from out of town?
I come from the North, but I was born here.
You need luck even when you're born.
It's so good that you're here.
-How are you? -Good.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I'm looking for Bianca.
Come with me.
This way.
May I?
Go ahead.
Thank you.
Take a seat.
Can I get you some biscuits?
I made them.
That's my mom. She died young.
She was a good woman.
No, thank you.
I'll get Bianca.
You'll need some patience with my sister.
Where's Antonio?
He's gone.
But why?
I've seen the picture of Schettino's wife.
It's the same as the picture Mom found in your wallet years ago.
I remember it like it was yesterday.
Antonio,
Bianca's sister is my daughter.
I grew up in Schettino's family.
When he got married, I was even his best man.
After a year, Bianca was born,
and he went crazy. He became an animal.
He wanted a boy.
He started drinking,
beating his wife, poor Cesarina.
Do you know how many times she came to our house at night and slept there?
And so…
I've never had the guts to look Maria in the eye.
I've never forgiven myself for that.
Does Mom know?
Antonio.
Do you know how Cesarina died?
She killed herself.
I HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU ANTONIO PARADISO
Paradiso.
Antonio!
So…
aren't you going to tell me that important thing?
Hey, done with school?
Dinesh!
Did you put the tea leaves in the sink?
Hasn't your mother taught you anything?
Watchman!
Call the plumber. The pipe has burst!
Sushant!
Dad!
I've re-directed the flow.
All the waste will go in here.
Okay?
This pipe needs to be replaced.
-Sushant! -Dad!
Come here.
You lazy bum.
What is it?
Come for a game of carom.
Coming. You start.
You won't score anyway.
Come down first.
Hang this up to dry.
One...
two...
three.
SOUTH MUMBAI COOPERATIVE BANK
Madam, your phone is ringing.
That's the problem with Indians.
We don't even trust machines.
The poor thing has told you twice that it's  40,000.
But no...
We have to count it all over again.
The machine's checked it twice. I've done it a third time.
I hope you won't count it again.
Why are these potatoes so big? Stock the smaller ones.
There won't be worms in this, right?
They don't ask my permission before they enter it.
-What's up, Sarita? -All good.
-Back from work? -Yeah. Why?
I'm coming from work, too.
Feels good to be productive, right?
Dinesh also works around the clock.
It feels good to be busy.
Our Guru always says, "To work is to live."
It was good catching up.
I understand. I'm not saying I won't do it.
But hear me out...
I've already booked the caterer for 200 people.
Right?
No, but...
But...
No...
Should I renegotiate the whole deal?
Yes, exactly.
I'll call back in half an hour.
No, I will, for sure.
I need to go.
Just give me a moment!
This woman's been chewing my ear off for an hour.
Tell me.
She's adding the groom's colleagues to the list.
Everyone takes advantage of my politeness.
The guest list keeps increasing,
like ants emerging from a wall.
You're not making it easier, either.
I've been telling you for days!
Look at my ceiling...
It looks so ugly.
I've been at your door since noon.
But Sushant's naps are deeper than our sleep at night!
No amount of pounding can wake him up!
I don't have the time to solve every problem!
I have a wedding to plan.
There are guests at home.
This makes me look so bad.
Isn't it your house, too?
Fix your sink right away.
-Here, call my plumber. -No...
-Plumber-- -I'll get it fixed tomorrow. Don't worry.
-Do you promise? -Yes.
Swear on my life!
Trust me, I'll do it tomorrow.
I'll die if you don't!
-What are you saying? -You've been promising for days.
-I'll get it done. -Fine.
You know I can't depend on Sushant, and I'm swamped.
Don't whine. I do enough of it. Go on.
Did you buy spinach today?
Why is the door open?
Dad left it open. That's four.
Hey, little one.
Hey, little one.
Don't call me that.
How long has the water been leaking?
Did Dad see it?
It was there before I got back from school.
Dad saw it, but he ignored it,
and threw a wet towel at me.
And he left the bathroom lights on.
Sameer, why are the board game pieces scattered all over?
The Jed from Scrabble was on the bed. It's worth ten points!
Mom, it's Zed. Not Jed.
I know, I know.
And why is this chess piece in the pencil box?
And sharpen pencils over the garbage can.
This house looks like a garbage can.
-It's dinner time. -It's the last one!
Did you throw this bill?
Dad spilled tea on himself.
He used the bill as a towel and chucked it on the ground.
Bro, we need seven points. Let's get it done.
Don't chase the queen for extra points.
He knows what to do. Don't instruct him.
What's your problem? He's on my team.
Some people need their hand held through life, Aunty.
Right, Aunty?
What do you mean?
-Why are you playing so slowly? -And what's so funny?
Answer me, Dinesh.
Your turn.
-Play. -Speak freely.
About what?
I've been noticing your jibes for days.
What's the matter?
Do you think you did all the work?
Do you?
We were partners, right?
So?
Who did all the work?
I picked up the slack.
-I found the clients. -Really?
I made the deals. I followed up. What the hell did you do?
Bastard, I brought in 19 of the 25 clients.
You've forgotten?
My former colleagues, my contacts at a cab company, my share-trading contacts...
You barely managed a handful.
Yeah, because I've only had one stable job for the last several years.
Unlike you, I haven't been job-hopping every few months.
If your job is so great, why did you go into business with me?
Just play.
Enough. Let's play.
Anju must have given him an earful, Aunty.
-He's taking his frustrations out on me. -Let it go.
-He's taking his frustrations out on me. -Let it go. Fuck the game. Let's leave.
Hang on. Why did he bring Anju into this?
-So what? -Shall I bring your wife into it?
-Careful, Dinesh. -Sorry, I forgot.
He's the wife here.
Sarita wears the pants in the house.
-Fancy yourself a comedian? -It's the truth...
Fancy yourself a comedian?
Don't touch me.
-Stop me, then! -You're...
Stop me, then!
You're crossing the line, Sushant.
-You're the wife. -That's too much.
-You're crossing the line. -Why do you hide when she's back?
Bastard!
Dad!
-Dad! -What?
What is it?
Mom is calling you.
I'll be right there. Go.
You go, I'll come.
Leave.
It's nothing. Go on.
Go on.
You go.
Go. Your husband's back after a long day.
Just shut up!
-Have you lost it? -Yes, I have!
Dad!
I've told you to be home by nine o'clock.
The food is cold now.
That's why we have a stove.
Be like Modi.
Yes, you heard right. Eat mushrooms and...
Reddy's been calling me all day.
...the secret to Modi's good health and agility.
Why did he call you?
When will you pay him back?
How did you know I owe him money?
Your friends only call me when you owe them money.
It's not a debt.
Just a few thousand. I'll return it.
Did you ask Dinesh about your commission?
Eat mushrooms and become like Modi.
Come on, Sarita.
We've had potatoes three times this week.
Eat mushrooms and become like Modi.
Can't you find other vegetables at the market?
Or paneer, maybe?
Potatoes for a couch potato.
Be more, you'll get more.
Dad's a potato.
Ladies and gentlemen, our next participant
is Sarita Sahastrabuddhe.
It smells so good.
Hurry up. I'm starving.
Sushant!
Yes, Tai.
Don't cook today.
I'm bringing you some curry.
Excuse me.
I'm here to see Mr. Govardan.
Sure, please have a seat.
It's okay. I'll stand.
Sir, there's a...
-What's your name? -Sushant.
Dinesh's partner.
Sir, Sushant is here. Dinesh's business partner.
What brings you here?
-I'm here to collect my commission. -Sir, he's here for his check.
-Okay. -Your partner picked it up yesterday.
Please, coordinate with him.
-How could he take it? -Okay, sir.
We're equal partners!
That's my half!
Why did you hand him all of it?
I need to talk to Mr. Govardan.
He's busy in another meeting. He can't meet you--
He's right there. I can see him.
I want to meet him.
I'm not here to beg.
I want what I'm owed.
Let me meet him!
Dinesh!
Why are you pounding on the door, Sushant?
-Where is Dinesh? -The doorbell works--
-Where is he? -Dinesh isn't home.
Oh, is that so?
-Where's he hiding? -He really isn't.
-You think I'm stupid? -What?
Did you just cuss at me? You're a fool.
I told you he isn't home.
Where is he hiding?
He's not here!
-Really? -What?
-What is this, then? -What?
What is this?
You should have hidden his briefcase.
His bike is parked outside.
Foolish!
He took a rickshaw today.
-Really? -Yes.
He took another bag.
Are you even listening to me?
-What? -Stop this nonsense.
-Come back at night. -Alright, fine.
Okay.
-Find a better excuse by then. -Yeah, sure!
I'll see you.
Are you okay?
-Did he leave? -Yeah.
Tell Dad to call the plumber.
"Tell Dad to call the plumber."
My friends are coming over tomorrow.
"My friends are coming over tomorrow."
Ask him to clean up the place and come back late.
-"Ask him to clean up the place--" -Ask Mom to get off my back.
"Ask Mom to get off my back."
Always giving instructions!
"Always giving instructions!"
Enough, Sameer.
Okay, Mom.
Bingo is the game for you. The next lucky number is two!
It's not my day!
I haven't found a single number.
Oh, the tea is here!
That shady guy who lives upstairs is always sneaking in and out.
No one knows what he's up to.
Who? Mr. Rajendra?
Yeah. What's his deal?
Ladies, the next number is three!
Still no luck.
He's the private assistant to a politician.
Private assistant?
What private business takes him away for days on end?
Hey!
The next number is 16!
Ah! Well done, son!
Pick out my number, too!
Plumber.
Tea leaves, rice... Do you dump everything in here?
I'm not the only one who makes tea.
Move these plates. I need a closer look.
-I'll do it. -Move!
Go be with your friends.
Move. You'll make it worse.
Move!
I was trying...
The plate slipped.
Sweet.
Have you lost your mind?
The bottle could've hit his head.
Don't fake concern. There's no audience here.
Now he wants to be a parent.
I made it clear. I said, come back after my friends leave,
keep the house clean, and don't bring the plumber.
Excuse me, you didn't say a word about the plumber!
-One second-- -You just asked me--
You just asked me to keep the house clean, and I did.
I can't even tell the truth with the confidence with which you lie!
Why would I lie?
-Why would I? -Am I lying?
Am I?
Sameer.
-My little one. -Let him sleep.
Are you scared of being exposed?
Little one.
-Sameer. -Sameer. Wake up.
-Listen to me... -No, listen to me!
-Hold on a second! -You hold on!
Yesterday, remember I told Dad about my friends coming over?
I said, tidy up, come home late, don't bring the plumber.
-She never mentioned the plumber, right? -I did, right?
-She didn't mention the plumber, did she? -I did, right?
-Try to remember. -She told me about her friends.
-But that's it, right? -Hold on! Sushant!
-Let me talk to him! -Let him hear what I'm saying!
Why are you shouting?
Try to remember, Sameer!
-You were repeating what we were saying. -Yeah, he was repeating it. Exactly.
Yeah, he remembers. What did you repeat? About her friends, the house...
-Nothing about a plumber. -You always play Candy Crush.
-Do you even listen to me? -Why bring Candy Crush into this?
Because you never listen to me!
I do. That's how I know you're lying.
But do you pay attention?
-Of course I do. -No, you don't.
-You didn't mention the plumber! -I did!
-Admit it's your fault! -Hang on.
Stop screaming! Sameer!
Sarita.
Is everything okay between the two of you?
I mean...
Neeta was talking about it.
She wasn't gossiping. She was concerned.
It's nothing.
Everyone is talking. Everyone knows.
You were both happy when you first moved in.
Sushant would play the guitar, on our birthdays.
You would sing... so beautifully.
Right?
Then something happened, because of the reality show.
These things happen.
Something changed after that.
Right?
He stopped playing, you stopped singing.
Why?
Money, Tai.
In our house, it starts there and ends there.
But you have a government job.
It's a government bank.
You must make a good salary.
A steady 25 to 30 thousand.
That's a steady income.
But steady doesn't cut it.
I'm tired of Sushant's indifference.
He hasn't been able to keep one job in five years.
Sometimes he drives for a cab company, sometimes he sells insurance with Dinesh.
He's given up on his music.
I gave up my dreams so he could fulfill his.
Yes.
I slog at the bank so that he can write his music.
But he isn't even trying.
He had nobody in Bangalore. He moved to Mumbai because of me.
He would depend on me for auditions, meetings and everything else.
That time, on the Shining Star show...
The lights came on and...
the audience was staring at me.
I just choked.
I couldn't find my voice.
It happens...
He's been punishing me ever since.
He's put pictures of me on stage all over the house.
I feel like the pictures are mocking me.
They remind me of that day.
Have you talked to him about it?
It's like talking to a wall.
Sarita...
Then you have to break that wall, brick by brick.
Express your feelings.
Take me, for example.
I was too shy to express myself.
I'm all alone now.
-Please get me some tea. -Okay.
When you edit the wedding video,
don't use lame Bollywood songs.
What do you prefer? EDM?
Be quiet. I'll deal with it.
-How? -Stop telling them what to pick, Niru.
You can't even pick a nail paint. Changes her mind five times a day.
Don't listen to her.
She just wants to show off.
Here's your payment.
She's even picked a groom who would look good in a suit!
Have you thought of a hashtag for the wedding?
Hashtag? Yeah!
We're using "Jana" from my name and "Gana" from his.
#JanaGana
That's perfect!
-That's cool. -The National Anthem. So patriotic.
-Shall we? -My tea...
-Tai? -Yeah.
Don't worry.
-You'll have the best wedding video! -Let's go.
-I promise. -Okay.
Stress-free!
It's genuine currency.
Why were you suspicious?
The man who deposited them looked suspicious.
He didn't look like a wealthy man.
You can't judge a man by his looks these days.
My milkman has an iPhone.
He laughs at my old phone.
Listen...
I heard that you used to sing.
Ladies and Gentleman,
please welcome our next participant,
Sarita Sahastrabuddhe, to the stage.
The lights went on!
The audience is visible.
I didn't turn them on.
You can turn it off, can't you?
Come, come...
Sarita, continue.
What do you want? Why are you following me?
Coffee?
Hello, Mom.
The trains were packed.
I missed two before I got one.
Little one!
Hey, little one!
Sushant...
He just stepped out to buy a new broom.
Here, talk to your grandma.
Hello, Grandma.
Yeah. Dad is always at home!
He has nowhere else to be.
I do more work than him.
-Shall we go? -Yeah.
-Are you coming? -Yes.
Hello?
Hello, madam. This is Reddy.
-Please don't-- -Listen, madam...
We're way beyond courtesies now.
You said your husband would call.
Why are you calling me?
I don't want to beg for my own money. Very sad.
I'm afraid my sadness will turn to rage.
Can you fix my shoe?
Let me see.
It'll be five bucks.
If it breaks again, I'll come back for my money.
It won't, Granny.
Bastard! Who are you calling "Granny"?
-I'm just 61. -I'm sorry.
-Don't call me "Granny!" -Okay, I'll fix it.
Get to it. I'll be back.
Reddy texted today.
To thank me.
The text said...
"Thank you.
Sarita returned 8,000."
You've already applied lipstick.
He agreed not to tell you.
That's why he sent a text.
He wants to insult me by telling me that my wife's repaying my debts.
You helped him do it.
Let's fight later. Okay?
Bring me the vermilion from the bathroom.
Damned if you help, damned if you don't.
It's not in here.
You keep it on the flush tank?
Isn't it fitting?
Sarita, don't joke about it. I'm serious.
Okay, don't get mad.
I'm taking the keys. We'll talk about it later.
Put it back there.
Tai,
I heard someone talking about a stash of cash.
Do you know anything about this?
Really?
Never mind. I must have heard wrong.
Probably.
I'll bring tea.
That's enough. I have to leave now.
-No, you can't. I'm not done yet. -I'll finish later.
Sarita, you can't go. You have to sing with us now.
Come on, let's get started.
Sharvari has told us you sing very well.
-Come on, sing. -That's enough. I'm going.
Wait, Sarita...
Hang on, Sarita.
Hang on, Sarita.
Sarita...
You're leaving already?
It's really late, Tai.
-Your henna is incomplete. -No, it's okay.
But hang on... What's the rush?
-Look at the tantrum she just threw. -Sarita...
Stop this!
Aunty?
-Why can't you hold your tongue? -Hey, come on.
I told you not to force her to sing.
She wasn't throwing a tantrum.
She has performance anxiety.
It's all drama.
Her eyes were on the clock.
There's something else going on with her.
I'll show you what's on her mind. Look.
I've forwarded it to Mrs. Joshi and Anju.
-Oh, my God! -What is it?
Will you defend her even now?
Don't show me this nonsense.
Veggies are easily digested. Chips constipate you.
I googled it.
Shut up, Sameer! You're constantly spouting trivia!
You're on Google all day, even when you should be doing homework--
There's no water in the bathroom.
The tap is making weird noises.
Either you call your plumber, or I'll call mine!
Sameer, pack up your lunch and come out.
I keep saying it: learn to look around you.
Wash up.
Move.
Listen...
Where did you get the money to repay my debt?
Mom returned some money she'd borrowed last year.
Hurry up, Sameer. Hurry.
Hurry up and get our bags.
Dinesh!
Dinesh!
What should we get Niru for her wedding?
A little cash in an envelope should do. That will do.
Don't be stingy. I'm always borrowing stuff from Tai.
Sushant, she does so much for us.
She's family.
A little cash won't suffice.
We will have to give at least two thousand.
Two thousand?
Yeah. So?
As a gift?
It's a wedding.
So?
Are you really so flush with money,
that you have money left over, even after settling my debt?
Mom gave me 15,000.
I won three thousand at bingo the other day.
After paying Reddy eight thousand I still have ten thousand left.
You still have 10,000 left?
Yeah, so?
Would you stand by and let me starve, while your plate is full?
I could clear up my debt with Reddy!
Sarita!
Sarita!
How could he do this?
Do what?
I've lost everything!
-Lost what? -What happened?
You...
You don't know?
You don't?
-Don't you? -No.
The  500...
-What? -What?
The  500 note is gone.
-Gone where? -The  1,000 notes are also gone.
-What? -He's discontinued it.
-Who did? -Hey...
Modi.
Modi who? What are you saying?
We have decided
that the  500
and  1,000 currency notes
presently in use
will no longer be legal tender from midnight tonight.
Brilliant!
Now all the dirty money will be flushed out.
...of  500 or  1,000.
That's a great leader!
...in the bank...
I told you good days will come!
DO THESE PEOPLE HAVE DIRTY MONEY?
Open the shutters.
Get in line!
Why can't I withdraw more?
Is this genuine currency?
It's real.
Does it have a microchip?
Next!
You can't withdraw  80,000. You'll only get  4,000.
Show me an ID.
Stay in line. Security!
-The guard is not here. -Security!
-Get in line! -Behave yourselves!
Stay in line!
-Madam! -I'll be back in a minute.
-Sir. -Yeah?
We're running out of the new currency notes.
What do we do?
Move aside, please.
Excuse me.
Security, pull down the shutters.
One moment.
One moment.
Please stay calm. Don't panic.
Those in here can withdraw money.
All of you will get money.
Please leave by the back door.
Alright?
Please cooperate.
Please...
Hey!
-Come with me. -Okay, sir.
Excuse me.
Shailesh, stand right here.
-Let them out one at a time. -Okay, sir.
Hello, Mr. Patil.
This is Sahni, the branch manager.
We have a huge problem here.
Please send additional forces.
There's a large mob here. They're getting violent.
It's been ten days since the demonetization announcement.
It's been ten days since the demonetization announcement. People are lining up on the streets. They are cash-strapped.
Regular life has come to a standstill.
But there's a silver lining...
-We're really lucky, Aunty. -Yeah.
We're witnessing the Modi magic, live.
He gave up his domestic life and lived like a hermit in the Himalayas,
all so he could bring us good days.
...the funding for terrorist groups has dried up.
Banning  500 and  1,000 notes
has foiled their devious plans.
...all operations run from Delhi...
Terrorists and Naxalites
are facing the heat.
The note ban has affected terrorists...
Did you know Modi lived a hermit's life in the Himalayas?
Yeah.
He also made tea and swept floors.
I'd be happy if you did either.
He left his wife, for the sake of the nation.
You're welcome to do that, too. That'll give me peace of mind.
What is your problem with Modi?
Modi isn't my problem. You are, Sushant!
The scenes at the bank are killing me.
The yelling, the crying...
I work for hours and then come home to this mess.
I don't have time to think about the Prime Minister!
And you have nothing but time!
Here, clean this mess. Become the Prime Minister!
Sushant!
Sushant!
Sushant!
Sushant!
Sushant!
Sushant!
Hurry up.
-Wait at the gate, and I'll come. -What if the bus arrives?
Then get in and go, like you usually do. Be a little independent!
Tai?
Tai...
Sarita!
The wedding planner called. He wants payment in the new bank notes.
The same with the caterer and the band.
-I'm scrambling to find the cash. Help me! -Tai...
Sameer is at the bus stop.
-The wedding must go on. -Call me after four o'clock.
I will lose face if the wedding is called off!
Sarita!
Okay, I'll call at 4:00 p.m.
Turn off the stove.
Got rid of all your dirty money?
Bro,
I'm not rich enough to qualify for dirty money.
Demonetization is for corrupt assholes who usurp our share.
Now they are shit scared,
queuing outside the banks, begging for money.
Are you okay, bro?
What do you mean?
I mean, with you and your wife?
Why wouldn't I be?
What is it?
It's all drama.
-She was watching the clock. -What are they talking about?
-Something else is going on with her. -She's just worried about work.
I'll show you what she's thinking about. Look.
-I'll show you. -What is it?
I've forwarded it to Mrs. Joshi and Anju.
-Look. -What is it?
Watch. You won't believe it.
What video is Aunty showing them?
I couldn't sneak up behind them.
Remember I told you?
Go ask Aunty.
Aunty's gone away. She'll return in a week.
Move.
Shall I show you what's on her mind? Shall I?
What?
What is it?
I've forwarded it to Mrs. Joshi and Anju.
-Look at this. -What is it?
Neeta Aunty!
-Did you just call me "Aunty"? -Sorry.
-I wanted to ask you something. -Go ahead.
At Niru's henna ceremony, you showed everyone a video, right?
Huh?
Right after Sarita left.
I didn't see anything.
And I don't meddle in other people's business.
Please, ma'am. I live alone.
I can't walk to the bank every day.
Aunty, the daily limit is 4,000.
Watch the news. All banks have the same rule.
Please, don't do this to me.
What am I to do?
Come back tomorrow.
Banks dole out cash, not sympathy.
Get help from the people you elected.
Next.
Lunchtime.
Let me eat at least.
-Let's go. -Yes.
What are you looking for?
What?
I think I forgot my lunch at home.
I must have forgotten it in a huff.
-Don't worry, we can share. -Okay.
This sari keeps bunching up.
Sushant?
You forgot your lunch this morning.
My husband would never bring my lunch to work! He'd eat it himself.
He wouldn't bring it to me.
He must have had some work in the area, so he brought it here.
-But at least he brought it here. -Exactly.
Wives never appreciate their husbands.
Mr. Sahni, this is Sushant. Sushant, Mr. Sahni.
-Hi, sir. -Hello.
So, you are the lucky man.
How did you land our gold-star employee?
I came to fetch a plumber that Gopal recommended.
I came to fetch him.
But he's closed his shop to go join the queue outside his bank.
I spoke to Mr. Joshi.
I found a cheaper plumber.
I'm trying to help. Please just let me...
-Do you hate me? -No.
Will you be late tonight?
Yes.
Shall I make dinner?
Is there something you want to tell me?
Like what?
Anything...
Let's wrap up.
There's a long queue outside the bank.
You can tell me anything.
Is there something you want to tell me?
Why do you talk to me in that way?
I take it, but...
It's your job, your plumber, your bank, your money.
-Everything revolves around you. -Okay.
Don't blame me for anything later on.
Okay.
You won't find another man like me.
All good?
Yeah, let's go.
I'll be late.
Are you okay?
My throat is a little sore.
-My throat is-- -You seem unwell.
What's up?
Carry on. I'll catch up.
The lines at the bank are impossible.
A guy I know has been waiting four days to get in.
You work at a bank.
So, we can help each other.
I'll forgive Sushant's loan.
What do you want from me?
I'll tell you.
I have an exchange scheme at my hotel.
I charge a 40% commission to exchange old currency.
300 for  500.  600 for  1,000.
I can source the new notes. No problem.
I need a way to deposit the old currency.
We can share the profits. 60-40.
I will give you 40% of my profits.
-There she is. -There she is.
-You open the door. I'll wait inside. -Okay.
Sarita?
Yeah?
Tai...
What's wrong?
-Sarita. -Yeah?
I called you. You didn't answer.
The bridegroom's family wants to postpone the wedding.
The invites have gone out, the contracts are in...
I don't know how I can postpone.
What are you looking at?
The daily limit keeps changing.
I don't understand.
What should I do?
Should I fight the decorator,
pacify the in-laws,
or queue up at the banks hoping against hope?
I have 80,000 in cash, in the old currency.
Just help me get 50,000 in the new currency,
and I can make some payments.
I know someone...
He'll give you 300 for 500,
and 600 for 1,000.
That will work.
Dinesh!
Open up! I know you're in there.
Dinesh!
-Sushant? -Where's the money?
Money?
Where's my money? Thought you could run away?
You're the one who takes off with people's money.
I have your money. It's safe. Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Give me the money.
It's all there. Count it.
Where's Anju?
She stayed in Nasik. She's unwell.
I need to speak with her.
About what?
It's private.
Anju and I have no secrets.
-Don't taunt me again! -Get off me.
Anju has a video of Sarita.
What video?
Sarita, with another man--
Are you nuts?
You're talking about Sarita in this way?
-Just tell her to send-- -An idle mind is the Devil's workshop.
-Get a job. -I need to see that video.
-You're crazy. Just count the money. -You've given me the old notes.
Sarita.
Dinesh gave me my money.
But they're old notes. I need to exchange them.
I'll do it.
Thank you.
I have a job interview at Amit Trivedi's studio tomorrow.
What kind of job?
Whatever he wants me to do.
You want me to work, right?
What I want to do is irrelevant.
If he wants tea, I'll make it. If he needs his floors swept, I'll do it.
Stay calm. Everyone will be served.
I respect women.
I can't help you.
It wasn't a request.
I was telling you it's your duty.
You don't have a choice.
For now...
deposit 50,000 in your account.
I don't have an account at this branch.
I said, deposit the money in your account, not at this branch.
This is the chance of a lifetime.
Demonetization...
only happens once every 50 years.
People are launching new companies.
So many new companies.
I might not have a lot of clout,
but I'm not standing in long queues like a nobody.
Just a small transaction. Take it.
Here, take it.
For today, 50,000.
See you tomorrow.
Same time, same place.
It's secluded enough.
Okay?
Thank you so much, everyone.
HAPPY RETIREMENT
But especially...
Sarita.
Sarita, you are supposed to be here.
With me. Come.
Please come.
Sarita, you must sing along with me.
Who are you?
Dad!
Mom wants you home.
They are Tai's guests.
From Kolhapur.
She asked if they could stay here. I agreed.
They're in the living room. It's not a problem.
I'll do it.
Feeling alright?
She's exhausted.
Maybe they are trying for another child.
What happened?
Feeling sick again?
Why are you sleeping in the kitchen?
The fan was on high-speed in there.
I couldn't handle it.
I'll go.
Just a minute.
Sarita, why did you turn off the fan?
Sarita!
I want tea.
Some tea.
What?
Tea.
Stay put.
Sameer's lunch. Your food.
Tea. Tai's guests can eat at her place.
Here are your snacks. Move.
Why are you locking the door?
Why are you sitting in the dark?
Sameer has gotten heavy. It's hard to carry him.
You could have carried him.
Your accounts don't mention your mom's money,
or the bingo money.
You went through my purse?
Money is flowing like water here.
There are new things around the house.
New flower pots, cushion covers, curtains...
Where is this money coming from?
Who's giving you the money?
The Phillips food processor you gifted today...
It costs  5,599!
Why isn't it accounted for?
-I've been busy. Don't overreact! -Oh, really?
So, you're that busy?
Yeah, I'm busy.
My workload has increased since demonetization was introduced.
This is from yesterday.
You've accounted for a packet of salt!
From the other day: Rickshaw fare -  25.
Chocolate for Sameer -  10.
Wait. There's more...
You've even written...
lemons -  5, and the vendor has a  2 balance.
A woman who accounts for  2,
cannot possibly forget to write down a gift worth  5,599!
Pick him up. I can't do it.
-Answer me, Sarita. -Get away from me, Sushant!
A gift worth  5,599!
Where is the money coming from?
Have you had it lying around?
You wouldn't understand, Sushant.
This dump finally looks like a home.
Okay, fine. But explain something to me.
When you knew I had a loan to repay,
you spent  5,599 on a gift instead?
I'd much rather do that!
If I paid off all your debts, we would starve.
When you start contributing to this household,
you'll have the right to question me.
So, only you care about our situation?
Don't I worry about money?
My parents might not be rich like yours,
but I give you a portion to put towards the expenses every month.
That's nothing. You give me  2,000.
The same amount for the last ten years!
Sameer is older and the rent has doubled!
Your  2,000 doesn't even cover the groceries, Sushant.
You fool!
-And don't drag my parents into this! -What did you say?
At least they don't beg for train fare when they visit, like your parents.
-My parents don't beg, they borrow! -Move!
-They're poor, but honest. -Get lost!
Not like your dad!
A junior officer in the Water Department,
who can afford to drive such a fancy car.
He's taken bribes from under and over the table!
So what? Why are you jealous?
At least he doesn't blame others for his failures.
Idiot!
Open the door!
If you're still doubting me, just call Mom!
Ask her all your questions.
At least that way, you'll talk to her.
She won't bite!
Why are you up, Sameer?
Go to sleep! We were talking!
The government has announced
all old demonetized currency has to be exchanged by tomorrow.
The deadline will not be extended beyond midnight.
No exceptions will be made for medical bills, water...
Rutu said you left early.
I called the bank.
You weren't there.
Where were you?
Someone has to actually buy the food you eat.
Why do you always snap at me?
I know you're lying.
I know everything.
Yes!
Go out and finish your homework, Sameer.
-Mom... -Hurry up. You have school tomorrow.
-Please, Mom! -Go do your homework outside.
Sarita, the laundry guy is here.
I've left the laundry pile on the chair.
And remind him that he still has a balance of  10.
Yes, madam. I have to pay him now.
Yeah, pay him.
Please repay Reddy as soon as you can.
I can report you to the cops.
That's okay, madam.
I won't do what you want.
I didn't even deposit the money you gave me earlier.
Sarita,
I don't think
you love your husband enough.
You're right.
Sort it out with him.
You don't know what I'm capable of doing--
Hey! Hang on. Let go of me!
Stay away from her!
You don't know what I'm capable of.
You want your money, right?
Here...
Two, four, six, eight, ten!
With interest!
I don't want to work for you and I don't want your money!
Sir, he bypassed the queue.
He was threatening a bank employee. Sarita, you go in.
I'll take care of it. Go.
What happened back there?
Was it a fight? What happened?
Why aren't you answering me?
Saru, say something.
No, not that.
Why are you crying?
What's the matter?
I just can't win.
Why do you say that?
I couldn't become a singer.
I choked on stage.
I lost the competition.
And the money.
Why do I always lose?
Think of it as a rehearsal.
Okay?
When it's time for the real show, you'll win!
Listen.
Sarita.
You will win. You're a winner.
Please don't cry.
I promise...
It'll be alright.
Another private assistant of this politician has been arrested.
They found suitcases full of new notes at his house.
Was this on the news?
Not on TV. I have my own sources.
The police are after the politician.
Check the news.
He has a total of six personal assistants!
Think of all the cash he's stashing!
Sarita Pillai?
I think he panicked and got caught.
I'm glad you told me about it. I withdrew some extra money.
Good thing you did.
Tai.
-Dinesh? -Yes, it's me.
-Anju? -Open up!
What's going on?
-Come to the balcony, I'll show you. -What?
The police are here!
Speak softly.
They went to Sushant and Sarita's.
-Why? -What do you...
Where do you think Sarita got all that money from?
Those notes that were stolen from her bank account...
Oh, God!
Are you sure?
Softly.
I had no idea it was the same money.
The bank robbers were caught.
They posted a selfie which went viral on WhatsApp.
And the police traced them.
It went viral. Right.
Right.
The notes stolen from you...
were from the first batch of minting.
According to the Reserve Bank's records,
they were delivered to the local politician's constituency.
Maybe someone from that constituency deposited them at my branch.
Listen, you're in the clear.
We're not arresting you.
Some politicians and their associates are on our radar.
They knew that the demonetization announcement was coming.
They colluded with bankers and exchanged their money beforehand.
What are you looking for?
Tai...
We've arrested the banker in Kolhapur. We have the serial numbers of the notes.
We just need to know if he deposited the money himself,
or if he sent one of his men.
How did you get hold of this money?
-Sir-- -I found those notes, sir.
Sorry?
In these pouches.
Is this all or is there more?
That's all I have right now.
Where did you find the pouches?
Downstairs.
What do you mean?
There's a drain downstairs. There may be more pouches now.
Can you show us?
There's one more pouch.
Put it in there.
Let's not be greedy. We'll get caught.
We're needy.
They're greedy!
-Yeah, but... -Here, take this...
Is that your house?
No, sir. That's Ms. Sharvari Tai's house.
I live above her.
Dinesh and Anju stay on the ground floor.
Mr. Rajendra lives on the top floor.
He's the politician's P.A.
Fine.
Take us to his house.
Sure.
Sarita.
Hey!
This way, sir.
How are you?
Hey!
This is his house.
When was the last time you saw him?
-Before the demonetization announcement. -Okay.
Fine, you may go.
Take his details.
Sushant,
where were you?
-Okay, we're leaving now. -See you.
Is someone here?
They're from the Tax department.
Why were they here?
They are searching Rajendra's house.
I see.
Anyway, take care of Sarita.
If you need help, let me know.
That's what good neighbors do.
I'm here for you too, okay?
Okay?
-Let's go. -Okay.
It was meant to be a surprise.
Sameer, careful.
Sarita!
Sarita!
You won!
What do you mean?
The income tax department sent a letter.
We helped them trace that dirty money last year, remember?
-We received a reward for that! -Seriously?
-Read it. -Let me read it.
"Ten percent of the confiscated sum is bestowed upon Sushant Pillai."
Sushant!
-They took down my details back then. -Right.
Well, hello, Mabel. What a lovely house.
Shall we go read together in the garden?
[woman] Mabel!
[Mabel] Coming, Mama!
When will they be here, Papa?
Any minute now, Mabel.
Are they nice people?
No, they're not.
-[chickens chittering] -[horse snorting]
How dis…
[Papa] Penny, they're here.
-[glass shattering] -Damn it!
Raymond, it's very muddy out here. My feet are getting wet.
Another girl.
Her name's Isobel.
Well, I can't see a thing.
Wait your turn, Georgie. We're packed in here like cattle.
How old are you?
[Mabel] I'll be nine in June.
Hmm, you look very small for your age.
Would you like to hold her?
No.
I'm cold.
Care for a sandwich?
[gasps] No.
[Mabel] Sandwich?
[man] Uh, no.
Did you make those curtains behind you?
Yes. Yes, I did.
She made my quilt too. And Isobel's shawl.
Poor children. [chuckling]
[snorts] Why, isn't that the Mayhew commode?
[woman] So it is.
Well, from the lofty splendor of the winter salon
to this gloomy corner of the world.
How we've fallen.
It belonged to my father.
Ha! Your father, worthless drunk!
Always whimpering. Whimpering about money.
Whimpering about debts. He was a whimperer.
Gambled away everything.
Oh, not the Mayhew commode!
And you, Raymond, with your education and opportunities.
It shocks me
that you still haven't managed to lift yourself out of this squalor.
I see your father in you, Raymond. It's a weakness.
Night night, Isobel.
They're very strange people, aren't they, Mama?
They have their ways, but they are family.
-[thumping, glass shattering] -[Raymond] Ow! [grunts]
-[door slamming shut] -[sighs]
There goes your father.
Is he sad, Mama?
He should be fine in the morning. He just needs some fresh air.
Damn it!
-[urine splashing] -[Raymond] You pathetic pig!
Look at you.
Eleanor was right. [murmuring]
Huh?
Huh?
-[Raymond] Penny! -[gasps]
I'm hungry.
Something amazing just happened.
A miracle!
What is? What are you saying, Raymond?
What happened?
Everything's changed. [chuckling]
Everything. [grunting, chomping]
Fantastic. Mmm.
Wine. Penny, wine!
Wine?
Honestly, Raymond, I wish you would just tell me--
-[thuds] -[gasps]
-[plates clattering] -[snoring softly]
Shouldn't we wake Papa?
[Penny] No, Mabel. Let him sleep it off.
Ah!
Good day, madam. My name is Thomas.
I'm here on behalf of my employer, Mr. Van Schoonbeek.
I'm here to discuss the terms of the agreement.
Agreement?
[Thomas] Um, your husband spoke with my employer last night, madam.
There was an agreement.
An agreement with who?
Mr. Van Schoonbeek. He's an architect of great renown.
He's graciously offered his services to build a house for you and your family.
Sorry, we're not in a financial position for anything like that.
[inhales] My husband must have gotten carried away.
You misunderstand, madam. It is a gift.
My employer has acquired the land surrounding your cottage.
It is here that the house will be built.
You will come into possession of the land as well as the estate upon its completion.
There is one condition.
The family must relinquish these premises and take up residence in the house.
And that is all? He doesn't want anything in return?
Money is no object to my employer, madam.
He is a great artist.
He desires nothing more than creative satisfaction.
This Van Schoonbeek was a friend of my father's.
He said we would be the envy for miles around.
A beacon of light on the hill, Penny.
Regrettably, Mr. Van Schoonbeek is a rather impatient man.
As such, we'll need your permission in writing today.
Yes, I'll…
[Thomas] Well, that's excellent.
So, when do you expect the work to begin?
Oh, I expect they've already started, sir.
Mr. Van Schoonbeek doesn't like to dillydally.
[Raymond] Well,
here we are.
Come on.
[Penny] Unbelievable.
[Raymond] Magnificent.
-[gasps] Oh! -[bushes rustling]
Ah! Good morning, Mr. Thomas.
You've brought some of your possessions.
[Raymond] Yes, just a few things.
The house is fully furnished, sir.
Mr. Van Schoonbeek specifically designed every piece himself.
Oh, but I have pieces here that have been in my family for generations.
[inhales] Of course. I understand completely.
I'll have the men store them somewhere secure.
-[door unlocking] -[keys jangling]
[Thomas] Through here, please. If you'd care to follow me.
[Raymond gasps] Look at those ceilings.
That's an interesting color.
This corridor leads to the sitting room, library, various closets,
the billiard room, guest rooms.
[Thomas] The west wing staircase.
And here we have the withdrawing room.
You can settle down here for the day if it pleases you.
Oh my. Look at that fireplace.
Look at this sofa!
[Penny] No curtains?
[gasps] A sewing machine!
[Raymond] Isn't it amazing?
Such fine material.
In the room opposite, you'll find the dining room.
A selection of dishes will be provided on a daily basis.
I shall take my leave now. Good day, sir, madams.
[Penny] Thank you, Mr. Thomas.
[Raymond] Oh, delicious!
Mmm, isn't it?
I'll never have to cook again.
[Raymond] Cooking? It's a bloody waste of time.
Who makes all this food?
Our servants, I suppose.
Ha.
Now, look at that.
How beautiful.
Mama. Isobel, she's getting tired.
Hmm?
That's nice, Mabel.
Come on, Isobel.
Good night, Mama.
Good night, Papa.
Good night, Mabel.
[Penny] Night night.
Look at that!
Our house.
[Raymond] Huh.
-[matchbox shuffling] -[ominous music playing]
-[spooky laughing continues] -[ominous music intensifies]
Come on, Isobel. Let's go.
[Thomas] Mr. Van Schoon…
It's… it is someone… someone… someone…
It's not just me. Not just me.
-Mr. Thomas! -[frightened gasp]
What happened to the stairs?
[clears throat] Good morning, madam.
Uh, Mr. Van Schoonbeek is making some minor adjustments.
You'll find a provisional passage in the billiard room.
Thank you, Mr. Thomas.
[Mabel] Oh.
Morning, Mama.
Mama?
Mama? Mama.
[Penny] Oh!
I… [sighs]
…must have fallen asleep.
Come here, Isobel.
There was a man outside my window. We can't see outside anymore.
Um, Mabel, I've got so much work to do.
Go find your father. I'll see what there is for breakfast.
But, Mama!
-[Isobel cooing] -[Penny] No, Isobel, don't touch that.
Morning.
We've just moved in.
-[spooky laughing continues] -[panting]
-[laughing] -[Mabel] Papa!
Mabel! Look at this.
[Mabel] Our home!
-[thudding] -[men yelling]
What are they doing?
[gasps] Well, I suppose they need the material.
[Raymond] Ah! Mr. Thomas.
[Thomas] Good evening. Mr. Van Schoonbeek has a request to make.
[Raymond] Oh! What's that?
[Thomas] He would very much like for you to accept these as a gift.
[Raymond] Oh my!
[Thomas] Please, take your time.
I'll wait here.
[Raymond] These are extraordinary.
[Thomas] Ah yes. Very good.
It's not too bold, do you think?
Oh, no, sir. No, no, no. Not at all. Why don't you see for yourself?
They're wonderful.
Yes, and so modern.
I'm glad you like them.
Mr. Van Schoonbeek has specifically created these garments
to complement his architectural vision.
You look foolish.
Both of you.
Mabel!
Why on earth would you say such a thing?
I'd like you to apologize.
Now, Mabel!
I'm sorry.
I hate this house! I hate it!
I wish we'd never left our home.
Isobel! Why aren't you asleep?
[Mabel] Wait, where are you going?
Isobel, come back!
Let's go back home. We… we shouldn't be here.
-[Isobel laughing] -[gasps]
Isobel!
[Mabel] Careful!
Wait right there. I'm coming.
You want to go in there?
Our home.
My books.
My doll's house!
"One day, Princess Esme woke up
to find everyone in the kingdom had fallen asleep."
"She sometimes wondered whether it was she who was actually asleep
while everyone else was awake."
-[stomach rumbling] -[Mabel groaning]
You're hungry, aren't you?
Little bit.
[Mabel] What's happened here?
[Thomas] Uh, madam. Um, Mr. Van Schoonbeek is very pleased with your fine work.
-Say, Mr. Thomas? -[Thomas] Sir?
You wouldn't happen to know what's wrong with this fireplace?
I just can't seem to get it going.
[sighs] I understand, sir.
Um, as it happens, I have something here you might find useful.
That's my old chair.
Indeed, it was stored away.
We were wondering whether it might still be of use to you?
I'm not sure I actually need it anymore, to be honest.
We have so many beautiful chairs now.
Uh, y… yes, indeed, sir.
I know what to do with it.
If you find yourself running low, there's plenty more in the basement.
The basement.
Yes.
Thank you, Mr. Thomas.
[Mabel] Listen.
Someone's there.
-[Isobel] Papa! -[gasps] Oh, it's Papa!
Papa! Help! We don't know where to go!
We're getting hungry!
Papa!
-We have to find a way downstairs. -Right away.
Mr. Thomas! We're lost. We can't find the stairs.
Mabel, Isobel, there aren't any stairs!
[sniffling] He's changed everything again!
I don't want this anymore.
I'm just… I'm just an actor.
He gives me a script!
I have to say things to you and do things!
And I just can't anymore! I just can't! I just--
I don't know where to go, Isobel.
I'm lost.
Mama?
[Mabel] My doll's house.
-[Raymond] Mabel. -[gasps]
My little girl.
-[gasping] -[cooing]
Papa!
Mama!
Leave, Mabel.
Get away from here.
-[fire crackling] -[gasps]
[breathing heavily] Ah!
Ah! Oh! Ah! [breathing heavily]
Leave, Mabel!
Please!
[Penny] Mabel…
[Mabel] Ah!
…save Isobel.
Ah!
[male] Derek, can you hear me?
Yes. Hmm.
Listen, Derek.
Because of the erratic nature of redevelopment and budgetary pressures,
I've had to let the construction guys go.
So, just deliver the kitchen ASAP.
Let me install it myself, all right?
But let me say this. I will be expecting some reimbursement.
If not on this job, then on my next refurb.
I mean, it's the least that you can do.
-[car engine starting outdoors] -Hmm. Yeah. Yeah.
Yes.
It would be a shame to ruin this relationship.
Now let's leave it at that, shall we, Derek? [grunts]
Excellent.
Fine. Sure. Yeah.
Difficult phone call. I'll talk to you soon, Derek.
Yes.
No.
I would like to talk to Erica Stephens in Business Loans.
Erica Stephens.
Business…
Well, I have 20 to 25 very eager cash buyers.
And while I'd always say that there are no certainties in life,
in this case, Erica, I'm pretty bloody certain
I'll be calling you with good news directly after the viewing.
I will call.
I promise.
[woman on radio]…Sarah Arnold, the senior economist
at the Economics Foundation.
Hi, Sarah, good morning to you.
[Sarah] Good morning.
[woman] You might say, "It's not a good morning, Vanessa."
"It's a horrible morning."
You just announced there's a recession on top of everything else.
How significant is it
when it's officially designated a recession?
What does it mean essentially? What do they have to base such a thing on?
[Sarah] So, um, a technical recession, which is what this is,
-is based on two quarters of falls in GDP. -[beetles chittering]
So this… this record falling GDP of 20%… uh, just over 20%,
which is the largest quarterly contraction in the UK economy
-since records began in 1955… -[grunts]
…with the Office of National Statistics--
[Vanessa] That's made it much worse. You realize that, right? Terrible.
-[dog barking outdoors] -[exhales, sighs]
Right. [exhales]
-Love you. -[camera shutter clicks]
Yes!
Oh yeah.
Ooh!
Oh yeah!
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
[contractor] Woo! Woo, woo! Woo!
[slurping] Ah.
Hey, did you get the photo?
Isn't it incredible?
I told Derek I just saved myself £3,000.
Yeah, piss off. That's what I told him.
And you know, yesterday,
I had three new potential buyers register online for the viewing.
Hey, I wanna send you some hotel ideas for the Maldives.
We deserve it, right?
Yeah, of course we do, sweetheart.
Yeah, of course. Sorry. Bye, sweetie. Miss you.
-Oh! -[chittering]
[AI voice] …wasp and bee nest removal.
Squirrel control. Bedbug. Flea and mite control.
Mole and rabbit removal. Ants, cockroaches, and other insects.
What do fur beetles look like?
-What types of fur beetles are there? -[grunting]
So, what actually are fur beetles?
What damage do fur beetles cause?
How do you get rid of fur beetles?
Fur beetles are persistent pests
that can eat at your carpets, clothing, and, in fact, all fabrics.
Getting rid of fur beetles is a real challenge.
On seeing signs of infestation, including larvae and brown fecal pellets,
take immediate action.
The larvae of the fur beetle do the biggest--
Right!
-[grunts] -[beetles chittering]
-[contractor] Yeah. Come on then! Come on! -[machine whirring]
Yeah. Yeah. You like it?
You like it, do you? You like it. Come on then.
[contractor] You're going down. You're going down. You're going down!
[grunts] You're going down. Yeah?
Take it! Take it!
Ooh, ooh! [straining]
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Shit!
Oof! Ooh!
You bast-- You fu--
-[bell tower ringing in distance] -[snorting]
[contractor] Hi, darling. It's me.
It's the biggest day of my life today.
If you could be thinking of me, you know, maybe say a little prayer,
I'd really appreciate it.
Uh…
Hello?
Come on.
Whoa!
-Come on! -[doorbell buzzing]
What?
No.
What is that… What?
No! Listen to me!
I got someone else's food. Don't you understand?
I'm hosting an event where people are expecting canapés and champagne.
All I've got is instant noodles and energy drinks!
Oh Christ!
Welcome. Welcome.
Hi.
Wha…
What? God!
-[doorbell buzzing] -[gasps]
[female] Chamonix has become terribly plebeian now.
[male] Yeah. It's like a supermarket.
The size is okay, but the layout is just confusing.
-Don't you think? -[whining]
Daddy, Daddy, look at me. [laughing]
Oh! Oh dear.
[inhales] Hmm. Oh.
-[crying] -[female 2] Oh, Isobel. Shh.
Right.
Now, for me, the sitting/dining room
is the beating heart of the house.
It's a place to rewind after a long, stressful day.
Comforting, luxurious. A family room, you could call it.
Just to reiterate,
fittings and furnishings are negotiable in the price.
But I think, like me, you appreciate excellence,
and that is what is being presented to you this afternoon.
I think we can all imagine ourselves stepping out onto the patio
and having a chilled glass of wine in the evening.
Maybe some snacks in a bowl.
[female 2 sighs] Would you please shut the door?
-[scoffs] -Canapé?
Uh, no, thanks.
Oh.
[male 2] Come on, darling. Let's go.
Get yourself… get yourself together.
Come on. Come on.
Right.
-Yeah. Oh… Okay. Okay! -[upbeat funk music playing]
-Carry on. Carry on. Enjoy yourselves. -[squeals, giggles]
I call this kitchen "The World's Kitchen"
because of the participation of so many countries
in its design and inception.
You'll all have noticed the gray veining in the central island.
The very last marble to be quarried from the Carrara region in Italy.
Pretty special.
We're walking upon Galala marble from Egypt.
You can feel that ancient history, can't you?
You can almost hear the Egyptians.
The sleek cabinets are Scandinavian but manufactured in Germany.
So, finesse but also durability.
As in all the rooms, lighting can be operated
through your smartphone or a virtual assistant of your choice,
whereupon you can access any number of tonal colors.
But really, the pièce de résistance of not just the kitchen
but the entire house, in my opinion,
is that one thing that none of us can live without these days.
Now, you all probably noticed that we had a situation with the catering,
which I do apologize for.
But even without a chicken
and as a statement of the person you are or the person that you want to be,
I think we can all see the majesty of this,
this exquisite kitchen appliance.
The Châteaux Rotisserie Oven.
[gasps] Mmm. Ah!
-[sighs] -[music skipping]
Um, the… the Wi-Fi seems to be acting up.
Ow!
[elderly male] We love what you have done to the house.
[contractor] You do?
Very, very much.
Is the furniture included in the higher price?
[contractor] Yes.
Wonderful.
Can we ask you some specific questions?
[contractor] Yes, of course. Uh, ask me anything at all.
[inhales] Is that a crepe weave fabric on the couches?
[contractor] I have the brochure in my office. I can check.
What building insulation have you used in the house?
Natural fibrous materials?
[contractor] It's a mixture of wool, paper, and cotton, actually.
Oh. Nice.
Oh. Uh…
Can you excuse me for a second, please?
Yes, bye. Bye. I'll be here if you, uh…
[elderly male] Delectable rugs.
[elderly female] So insulated
and… and comfortable.
All good?
What funny shoes.
You should take them off. No need for them now.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Can we have a look at the show bedroom?
Yeah, it's just through there. Feel free.
I'll be downstairs if you need anything at all. Just call.
We're very interested in your house.
That's great news.
Extremely interested.
Yes!
Now where is that little shit?
Come on. Come to…
Oh Christ!
Come on then.
Just bounce.
[contractor] Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
[contractor] Oh.
What are you doing?
We thought we'd turn in.
What? You mean sleep here?
Well, it is a bedroom.
We're extremely interested in the house.
Right. Uh--
Could we trouble you for two cups of tea?
[clicks tongue] Well,
good night then.
Sleep well.
[contractor] Jesus, Erica.
-[indistinct chattering in distance] -[exhales]
-[beetles chittering] -[gasps, whimpering]
[contractor] Tell the others at the bank I have buyers secured.
Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I know. It's fantastic.
I'm in the city, walking into a meeting
with their solicitors right at this moment.
Sorry, what? The name of the solicitors?
Mmm, let me check that. I'll get back to you.
[elderly male] Mmm, our television is very difficult to work.
[spluttering] I… I can take a look--
Do you have any more canapés?
No, I'm afraid not.
What, with the viewing being officially over.
[elderly male] We are extremely interested in the house.
Yes, but exactly how interested are you?
Perhaps we should start negotiating with your representatives?
Yes, we should, really.
Really?
Well, maybe you could get your solicitor on the phone? Invite him over.
We should invite them over for some food, straightaway.
Good.
If you could find any food, that is.
[host on TV] A perfect example of what we call black mold on the wall.
Now, this is an outside wall,
and you can see the spots growing up here on the surface of the wall…
[host] …and even the ceiling.
The mold's, generally speaking, black, but sometimes white--
They are going absolutely nowhere.
It's insane.
Because I had no one else to call but you!
Please don't put the phone down. I've invested my whole life in this house.
You know that, darling.
Okay. Okay, I'm sorry.
I will never ever call you darling again, sweetheart.
-[line hangs up] -Oh! Damn it! Damn it!
-[printer whirring] -[panting]
-[squealing] -[music ends abruptly]
-[music ends abruptly] -[blow-dryer whirring]
All right. It's pretty obvious you have no intention of buying this house.
You think you can just lounge around like this forever?
Eating my food, drinking my drinks?
No!
I'm ringing the police. I'm ringing the police right now!
The phone is ringing.
Yes. I'd like to report a… Well, I'm not too sure what it is.
A breaking and entering situation without the breaking.
An entering and then a refusal to leave, let's call it.
A hostage-taking,
in which the house I'm trying to sell is being held hostage. It's…
-[doorbell buzzing] -It's confusing, yeah.
I just need you to send a couple of police officers over quickly
to Van Schoonbeek Lane.
Christ, that was quick. They're upstairs in the bath.
[male officer] Do you have a dentist called Dr. Jafri, sir?
Yeah, has… has something happened to him?
My God! Is he all right? I… I…
[male officer] We've heard from Dr. Jafri
that you've been telephoning him at all times of the day, sir.
Yeah. So, what?
[female officer] You're sharing with him personal details about your life,
which he, as your dentist, has absolutely no interest in.
Right. Uh--
[male officer] You're overfamiliar with him,
and occasionally, you call him "darling" or even "sweetheart."
All of that is true, but none of it's important.
I've two guests upstairs in a bath who are refusing to leave my house.
[male officer] You call Dr. Jafri again, and he will take you to court.
Do you understand, sir?
Take me to court? Come back here!
I've done absolutely nothing wrong. What are you talking about?
And who might you all be?
Oh, don't… don't mind me. Yeah. Oh.
They've been looking forward to seeing our house.
-Your house? -They are our family, visiting.
Your family?!
They're actually very nice people.
They lived here before, you know.
[splutters] Fuck!
-[elderly female chuckles] -I've had enough! Enough! Do you hear me?
Where's that… where… where…
[elderly female] Now fix us a cup of tea, like a good man.
I'll give you tea, you bloody vermin. Yeah. Yeah. Are you ready? Are you ready?
A nice cup of tea? Nice cup… nice cup… nice cup of…
Time to get you home.
-[slow dramatic music playing] -[water gently crashing]
Wallpaper, apartment 3. Hmm.
Uh…
Not again!
Hmm.
Ooh!
Ooh. [sighs]
Ah. [chuckles]
Ooh!
[sighs] Oh!
Whoa! [exhales]
Huh?
Oh! No!
[gasps] Oh no. No. No!
No, no. N… n… n… no. No, no, no, no.
[yelling, grunting] Ah!
Ah. G… good morning, Rosa.
It's the afternoon.
Oh. [chuckling]
-Okay. -You know what day it is today?
Um, is it… Wednesday?
[sighs] It's rent day.
Oh, uh, are we still doing that?
Yes, we're still doing that!
Um, when was the last time I… I paid rent?
With actual money?
Twelve weeks ago.
Ah. So, long time. [chuckling]
Yeah.
Well… [sighs]
…just so you know, the shower water is brown again.
Okay.
I didn't wanna say, but it just has this really weird slippery texture.
Yeah, I know. It affected my paste.
Yeah, it would do. You can feel it on my arm.
You know, if you paid me in money, I'd have the resources
to get the proper equipment to fix the plumbing.
Uh… [sighs]
-I can pay you with fish? -[Rosa] No. No more fish.
You have to eat, and fish are an important source of--
Elias! For God's sake, just find me my rent. Okay?
Okay.
Uh, I think I'll go and dry my fur.
Yeah, go on, then.
-[beetle scuttling] -[exhales deeply]
Affix floorboard to the other floorboards.
Uh…
Hey.
[Rosa] Jen.
Jen!
-[Jen vocalizes] -[music abruptly stops]
Morning!
It's three o'clock.
Hmm.
And soon it'll be four and then five!
Yeah, that's how it works.
Oh, I gave up on time years ago. [chuckles]
Right. Who needs it?
[gasps] But today is rent day. Am I right?
Yeah. I'm really looking forward to being paid my rent.
Here it is. The obsidian crystal.
A reliever of emotional blockage
and promoter of compassion
to help you find your true sense of self.
You've given me ten of these already and still no money.
Let's eat.
Of course I knew it was going to be difficult.
I mean, the scale alone is enormous,
but every day, I can see the real potential of this house.
And if only I had tenants.
Well, they all left.
-Yeah, I know they left. -Because of the flooding.
There's still me and Elias, of course.
Yeah, but I'm talking about good tenants.
Proper ones, who would pay me with actual money,
instead of fish and stones.
Crystals.
I can't buy supplies with crystals.
You can realign your energy chakras.
Yeah, but it won't fix the electrics or whatever else needs doing.
You could try.
It wouldn't hurt.
I've always loved this house, you know.
Hmm.
It's devotion, really.
How wonderful it could be.
Right.
I'd smarten it up
and then get residents in to pay for further restoration.
Then, over time, you move everyone out.
And then the house will be finished. It will be… [inhales deeply]
…stunning.
-The house deserves it. -[Jen humming mantra]
Right now, I just need the, um, right… support.
Yeah, yeah. I… I just don't have the right support.
Ah. Oh!
Um…
Have I spoken to you about my spirit partner?
What do you mean? A boyfriend?
That term doesn't describe what he is, really.
Okay. What about him?
-He's arriving tomorrow! -Does he have any money?
We met eight years ago at a Tibetan throat music workshop.
We've been communing ever since on the astral plane.
No money then.
I wouldn't think so, no.
But he's a wonder, Rosa.
-A celestial force. Truly. -Yeah, well, I'm not running a charity.
I'll be telling him that and making myself clear.
I'm sure he'll have his uses.
Yeah, sure. Right.
Oh, I was wondering about, um, the shower in my bathroom.
What about it?
It's been making some terrible noises, and the water's brown again.
Hmm.
Oh.
There we go.
Oh.
Hey.
-[scoffs] -[Jen continues chuckling]
Hmm? [grunts]
What… what the…
What the…
-[clapping] -[Elias] Whoa!
[Jen] How wonderful!
[Elias] That was amazing!
Oh, that's just a little something I picked up in Tibet.
[chuckling] No, no. No applause, please.
I am merely a conduit to the melody.
A portal to a different music.
Another dance.
A messenger, basically.
How long have you been traveling?
Always. Always traveling, my child.
And yet, with each second, the journey shortens
as I get a little bit closer to this…
…synthesis of celestial grace.
[gasps] He's talking about me.
I brought you some earthly gifts, angel.
For purification, the banishment of discord,
and a rebalancing of one's physical dwelling.
-Mmm. -[coughing]
I didn't get your name.
Hmm? [gasps]
How rude of me.
Rosa, this is Cosmos.
And how long are you planning to stay, Cosmos?
Ah, there are never any plans with me.
There's only moments snatched from the wind.
-What are you talking about? -It's not like we're short of room.
The house is huge.
A traveler cannot be bound by earthly walls, Jen.
I sleep in the open.
Oh.
-Whoa! Wow! Jeez Louise! -[exhales]
-Mm-hmm. -What a day!
Let me prepare some food from my garden.
Go on, you can go in if you like. Have a look around.
Yes, please. [chuckling]
-Whoa. It's really cool in here. -[sniffing] I'm sensing a negative energy.
Yeah, it's coming from me.
Mmm, you're protective of Jen, and for that, you have my gratitude.
Actually, I'm protective of my property.
So, um, when will you be getting off it?
I will move on when the mist has lifted.
Probably. But only time will tell.
Yeah, well, I should be charging you for pitching that tent.
[chuckling] Charging.
What is money
but some physical denomination of coin and note?
That's exactly what it is.
I move in an ocean of bartering myself.
Oh yeah? And what is it that you barter with?
My skills.
So, what you're looking at right now is the finish, obviously, the dream.
Everybody left when the rains came, so I need to get some new paying tenants.
Then I'll have some real money to play with.
I already have a ton of paint and wallpaper.
Hmm.
You must begin with the roots.
Right, exactly!
The… the heating, electrics.
I've got some problems with this brown water from the taps.
You have to nourish the soul of the house to unleash its potential.
Right!
Enliven its chakra.
Ye… Mmm.
Maybe you can start with the plumbing?
Mmm.
Plumbing is a little invasive.
I would like to get to know the house first,
possibly through some gentle carpentry.
I… I have a floorboard
that needs replacing in the upstairs corridor?
Perfect. I'll make a start tomorrow.
Yes! [squealing]
Um…
I mean, um, thank you. Uh…
This is going to be great.
Oh, the reawakening will be beautiful, Rosa.
Beautiful.
[sniffing] Uh…
-[Cosmos chanting] -[Elias] Yes.
Yeah.
Chika-chika-chika-chika.
-Come on, your turn! -Oh, no. No. I… I don't.
-Come on! -Ooh!
-[Elias] There you go. -Come on, Rosa!
-[humming] -[chuckling]
Woo!
-[laughing] -[humming]
-[wind whooshing] -[crickets chirping]
-[wood clattering] -[banging]
-[sighs] -[wood clattering]
What the… [sighs]
What the hell's going on?
Ha! Someone had a bit too much to drink. It's the middle of the day!
-What are you doing up there? -Seize it! Embrace it!
-[scoffs] -[Cosmos laughing]
Oh yeah, man. That's banging.
No!
[whimpering] No.
Oh! The water's still brown, Rosa!
[Rosa] Oh.
Oh! No! Oh no!
-This isn't the plan! My plan! -[drum beating]
Have you forgotten everything we were talking about?
I'm sensing that negative energy again.
You've destroyed the corridor!
Realigned it.
You've pulled up every floorboard!
Yes, but for a boat, Rosa. A boat.
You have a boat! You have a boat outside!
-Well, the boat's for me! -Right. The boat's for Elias.
Ugh! Oh God! What was in that wine, Jen?
Take it in one go. It's a bit pungent.
Oh! I've got a nonaggressive solution to the plumbing.
[gasps] That's great news.
I need some mint, a cabbage, two vials,
this drum to signify a heartbeat, and a tambourine for affectation.
Get out of my house! Get out! Get out!
Oh! Yes, Rosa! Harness that strength!
-[Tibetan chanting] -[humming]
Oh Christ!
Take that boat apart, you!
I want every one of those floorboards back inside the house where they belong.
-Seriously? -Yes, seriously.
You're ruining everything I'm trying to fix!
It's… it's only a few floorboards.
It's a whole corridor.
How is anyone supposed to access their rooms
if I don't have a corridor, Elias?
What are you even doing?
Wha… [sighs]
Cosmos said he'd help me leave.
Wh… what?
You… you're living here for free. Why would you want to leave?
Because everyone does.
By tomorrow, the water will be in the house.
Oh, go then! Here, take them!
I'll… I'll rip up your room and fix the corridor myself.
You can't stay here, Rosa. Why can't you see it?
[Rosa] I should've got rid of you months ago. Paying with fish!
I'm going to get better people than you and Jen
and finish this house myself!
[sighs] Go on then! Leave!
Uh…
Ugh.
Hmm.
Thank you.
Bye!
Why didn't he say goodbye to me?
Didn't you say your goodbyes already?
No, not really.
I didn't think he'd go.
He just needed a little guidance. That's all.
There's nothing better out there anyway.
For those who decide not to find it, there can be nothing.
If he dies, it's your fault, you know.
He wanted to leave a long time ago, Rosa.
Well, he never told me that.
He didn't want to hurt your feelings.
Oh, whatever!
He was never any use to me anyway.
Bloody fool.
What the… What is that?
Oh, that.
Yes. I thought you might need it once the mist has come and gone.
What? What are you talking about?
It's a lever. You can push it.
For your emancipation, Rosa, should you choose it.
You just give it a bit of body weight, and you'll be good to go.
Ooh!
Stop talking, you lunatic!
Just take it down!
You're destroying everything!
[Elias] Goodbye, Rosa.
Thank you for giving me my first real home.
Here are two presents.
Your friend, Elias.
-[Jen] Are you all right? -[quietly] Huh?
I didn't know he could draw.
Didn't you?
Do you want to have some lunch?
One last time, before I go.
When are you leaving?
We'll leave later, Cosmos said.
The morning, maybe.
I don't want to see him.
Just us then? Final meal together?
What do you think?
Fine.
It's not much, I'm afraid.
The water took the whole garden.
Why don't you ever talk about the flood?
[Rosa] There's nothing to talk about.
[Jen] I know you've been busy with your project.
So you're just leaving with no plan. Is that it?
That's right.
You'll never find a house like this again.
There'll be something else.
-It's time to move on. -Where to?
We don't know. We have to try.
Look, what is it you want?
To fix this house.
To make a home with good memories for myself,
but I've been fighting this place for bloody years.
Don't be frightened about being someone else.
Oh, for God's sake.
Try to see the good things that you did make.
Love your past but travel on.
[sighs] You're sounding like that lunatic.
He's only here to help you move on, Rosa.
Yeah, well, he doesn't know me.
None of you do.
Now.
Don't be afraid.
What?
What do you mean, "don't be afraid"?
Jen?
Jen, where are you?
Wh… what's happening?
Jen?
Hello?
Jen? Anyone? Je… [whimpering]
Where are you?
[whimpers] Wait!
Uh, don't go!
Hello?
Hello?
[shrieks] No! No! No!
[whimpering] No, no, no, no!
Oh!
No!
-[exhales, gasps] -[Elias and Jen laughing]
Jen?
Stop! Stop! No!
No!
Wh…
Elias?
Goodbye, Rosa.
What?
-[grunts] -[floorboards creaking]
-[shrieks] -[water splashing]
Wh…
[Jen] Rosa!
Jen?
Jen!
[Cosmos] Come on! Join us, Rosa!
[Rosa] I can't! I can't!
[Jen] Come on, Rosa!
I can't get to you!
Just come back!
Please!
I want to go.
Please.
Let me leave.
Huh?
-[Cosmos] You can do it! -[Jen] Come on, Rosa!
Yes! [laughing]
[Elias] Yay, Rosa!
Woo! [chuckling]

COURT OF NAPLES
WE HATE ROMA!
SASÀ LIVES
You made it at last!
Guys, I've been callin' you for three hours!
It's Ciro's fault. Three hours to get that Little Tony quiff.
It's not even in, now!
It's about style. You're a pair of Gypsies!
Style? You're more of a Gypsy than we are!
Chabbù, what do we need to do?
Get that dickhead out the way!
Come on, Angelo!
Let me up!
Fat bastard!
Come on, Fiore!
From below, you need to push. From below!
Go! Go!
-You can do it! -Go! Come on! Help Lardarse up!
Come on! Help Lardarse up!
Cool it!
I'll let you open it, calm down.
Your rucksack.
It's the banners.
Gabbiano!
Hands up! Come on, fuck!
Apache!
This girl calls me... "Come on, let's go out." I was totally out of it. I sent Reggio instead.
I was totally out of it. I sent Reggio instead.
And all the time, guys, she was calling me by his name, "Roby!"
And all the time, guys, she was calling me by his name, "Roby!" I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, love!"
I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, love!"
Ever shagged a girl like this?
We shag 'em in the family!
Guys...
How you doin'? Fine. You?
You bring the bombs?
Yeah, we're loaded.
Can I set one off now?
You speak too much! Learn to shut up.
Well done. I'll tell you when you can set them off.
When will you take us to an away game? -When? -Take us!
-If you're good, I'll take you. -But we're not good, you know that.
Teach your brother as well. See you later, lads.
See ya, Pechegno.
This is our fucking terrace!
-So cool! -He's a beast.
We're the Apache!
Fucking move!
Honour our friends!
Let's hear it for our friends who aren't here today!
Honour to the banned!

POLICE STATION
Everything OK?
Good afternoon.
Napoli playing at home. Trying to extend this run of victories...
May we?
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
ID.
Still with the ID, Officer? Are we still at this stage? Damn it!
Here you are.
All the time we spend here, we might as well work with you.
Alessandro Russo...
The visitors are fighting to stay up, a situation that seemed unlikely at New Year.
a situation that seemed unlikely at New Year. While the Azzurri want to fulfil the dream of winning...
DAY 34 OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP
No problem for the home side in these last few minutes...
No problem for the home side in these last few minutes... The Blues winning 3-0, and controlling the game without any difficulty...
and controlling the game without any difficulty...
Ist das mayonnaise?
No, it's salmon, cheese and salmon...
America'! You wanna get rid of these two?
Go away, oh!
Come on, move! Raus! Raus!
Eins zwei Polizei!
-What's wrong with you? -Oh, Michelone, what did I do?
Played the arsehole you are.
-One more goal, I've won my bet. -A nice present, Michelone!
-I'll take you to dinner. -Dinner and then a present!
You're not just taking us to dinner and saving on the present.
I should kick you all out! You lost me those two customers.
I didn't do anything.
It was you two.
We saved their lives!
So it's our fault you couldn't sell your shit sandwiches?
You still goin' on?
I'll give you the money, America', but lemme hear the game.
-If I win this bet...! -No!
Can we not watch it on TV once in a while?
On the radio! Not on TV!
Now it's a corner, as well!
...Looking to the last four games, and preparing for the meeting in Rome,
the last match which will decide this championship...
How come you've got the keys?
My uncle got a rebuilding job here.
Get in, quick.
Fuck off, you shitty Neapolitans!
Oi, Sandro! Hey, Angelo.
-Open up. -Yeah.
-Oh, bloody hell! -I'm destroyin' you.
-Where are you going? -Did you fucking see that?
-Fuck off, you thumped him. -You don't know how to play!
Don't piss me off...!
That's enough. I'm not playing. Let's eat.
-Finish the game! -I don't want to play any more.
-Come on, finish the game. -Enough!
I don't want to play!
Let's eat, Angelo, come on!
-Come on, Sandro, finish the game! -No!
-Sandro! -No!
-Come here and finish... -Finish what? It's 6-0!
Come on!
Sandro!
Don't get pissed off. Come here.
Always with a joystick in your hand. Have you not got a girl?
I can't move for women. Half the school's after me.
While you never get laid!
Half the school? What, are you going to school now as well?
Doobie school, you not know?
Shut up!
What are you doing?
-Spaghetti, oil and garlic. Ready! -Damn...
Spaghetti, oil and garlic?
What are you feeding me now?
What are you talking about? Come and see this spag I've made!
It's really something.
At least put some cheese on it.  Angelo, you don't put cheese on spaghetti with garlic and oil!
Who ever heard of such a thing?
Cheese with garlic and oil! No way!
I refuse even to give you it.
At most I could do you "runaway clams".
What's that?
When you sprinkle it with a load of parsley.
It ends up tasting like spaghetti with clams.
They used to make it when people were short of money.
-Mum made it for us. -Enjoy your meal.
You too, Angelo.
It was really cool today at the game.
A bunch of us got beneath the Brescia end,
and we launched a load of bombs, you should have seen them.
Running in all directions they were, like ants.
Bombs, Angelo?
You've got bombs in your head!
What are you doing?
Nothing, I wanted a sip.
So ask.
Sandro, can I have a sip?
-Now you can have a sip. -Thank you, Sandro.
-Now you can have a sip. -Thank you, Sandro. You're welcome.
Where did you get this? At a party? -Someone gave it to me. -That explains it.
-Someone gave it to me. -That explains it.
Two puffs and he's out of it.
-Fuck you, Angelo. -He's totally out of it!
Watch for the lines.
Oi, Lardarse!
What the fuck have you done here, you dick?
-Maestro. -You OK?
D'you want me to kick you out?
What are they doin'? You deserve a slap in the face!
You deserve a slap in the face!
I just told you to watch the lines.
Did you understand?
Oi! Yes or no?
Gabbiano... Hey.
You're such a dick!
Cool it a bit, will you?
-He's getting on my nerves. -Go and smoke a doobie.
Fiorelli'...
we explained this to you. D'you wanna learn, yes or no?
The lines need to be straight.
Guys, is there a can of white?
Sure, here.
Sort that mess.
See?
Easy.
Look how good Angelo is.
You see this hand?
Tomorrow you can come to mine and do the bathroom!
Fiore', handsome!
You need to chill and keep calm!
They're getting to me!
They're kids, they're learning. Come on.
Hey, Mohica'.
Let me have a shot on that bike, I'll fly from here to Ponticelli!
Do you not have a home to go?
You wanna take us to your house?
Always in the fucking way!
"Let's burn the capital"?
What's this?
Pechegno, have you turned stupid or what?
It's the banner. What's the problem?
You're doing a banner without the authorisation of the group?
-It's done now. -Oi, you shut up!
We decided the banner in the stadium.
-You? -Yeah. And who the fuck are you?
We founded this group.
We've got the stadium bans. We're the ones who decide.
Bara', if we wait for you for every decision, we'll be old men.
Here's another one!
Yeah, but decisions are made in meetings with everyone.
And you know that.
And then away fans are sure to be banned for Rome.
So? What do we care? We need to go anyway.
You taught us that!
It's our last chance. Are we meant to hang about here like dicks?
Maybe you didn't understand, bro'.
Listen to me... nobody's going to Rome!
Nobody's to go anywhere near Rome!
The debate ends here, full stop!
Now get rid of this fucking thing off the wall!
Come here, you!
Mcinto', you really are a dickhead as well, though!
-Let's get this down! -How was I meant to know?
What were you doing here?
Why are you getting mixed up in this shit?
Sandro, where are we going?
-It's a surprise, don't worry. -We've been walking for three hours.
What is this place, Sandro?
Angelo!
Angelo, where are you?
I'm here, Sandro.
What the fuck are you doing there? Come down and help me.
Coming.
Angelo, get that sheeting and put it here.
If we get the banner dirty, Barabba will kill us.
That year with Atalanta we beat the shit out each other.
I even got stabbed. I've still got the scar.
That's gross.
A few months later I got a message from one of their leaders,
inviting us to this Atalanta party.
They have this party every year,
and this message said,
"We'd be honoured to welcome our Neapolitan rivals".
We had a laugh at this. It made no sense. We're enemies. They're inviting us to a party. Are they mad?
They're inviting us to a party. Are they mad?
But about ten of us got together and went.
But about ten of us got together and went. Barabba, Mcintosh, O'Nan and your brother Sasà as well.
Barabba, Mcintosh, O'Nan and your brother Sasà as well.
We set off in two cars and arrive there.
Angelo, when we got there, it was total madness.
Angelo, when we got there, it was total madness. Thousands of people, singing, tear gas, smoke bombs, a tank, even!
Thousands of people, singing, tear gas, smoke bombs, a tank, even!
A tank?
Angelo, a tank. They're madder than us!
Anyway, we took up position in a corner, all of us suspicious and unsure,
ready to kick off at the first sign of trouble,
also because we'd gone ready for anything.
We had bars, bats, chains...
These two guys from Bergamo appeared in front of me, and go,
"Hey, Napoli, come on, relax a little! Have a beer, it's cool!"
in that weird accent they have.
We look at each other,
what do we do? We decide to have a beer.
what do we do? We decide to have a beer. We have the first, the second, the third... Fifteen minutes later, Angelo, we're all drunk.
Fifteen minutes later, Angelo, we're all drunk.
Barabba was dancing and pouring beer on his head.
O'Nan was acting cool, like a dancing instructor... Mcintosh hitting on anything in a skirt...
They decide to take us to a disco. We get to the disco, we keep drinking,
We get to the disco, we keep drinking,
all of us drunk, we all ended up hugging like a big gang of poofs...
In the end I realised that between Naples and Bergamo, North and South,
In the end I realised that between Naples and Bergamo, North and South, deep down, we're still us...
WILD SPIRIT
I see this guy, I'm, like, "Fuck, I know him!" Where from?
Boom!
I realise who he is... -Who? -The guy that stabbed me.
-Who? -The guy that stabbed me. -No! What did you do? -I swear!
I gave him a Glasgow kiss and he hit the ground.
Soon as the others saw me, Barabba started hitting them, and he drew blood every time.
Barabba started hitting them, and he drew blood every time.
-Michelone, he's a giant... -I can imagine...
He was picking them up like rag dolls, banging them on the ground...
And your brother was like an eel when he fought,
cos he was skinny...
Bang, bang, bang and away... But then in the end...
Sorry, I have to go.
You need to go?
Where are you going?
I need to go.
You really are a slut!
Drop dead!
You can't leave me like this...
You wanna watch the game?
-No, sorry, I'm working on Sunday. -Take a day off...
Get into the house.
-Ma, what d'you want? -Get in, I said!
What d'you want? I'm talking, can't you see?
What d'you want? I'm talking, can't you see? No, I can't. Move!
Angelo, go home.
-Bye, Sandro. -Bye, Angelo.
You're still hanging about with my son?
Stefania, I'm just watching he doesn't fuck up.
Have you seen yourself?
Seriously, you think you have anything to teach him?
You already got one of my sons killed.
I never want to see you again. Get out of here.
Move!
Take it easy, you're gonna wreck the bed.
Hang on, I'm coming.
But you didn't come... I'm sorry.
Yes, I did, before, didn't you notice?
Yeah, maybe I know when.
What's this tattoo thing here?
Nah, nothing... It's a retro gecko.
It's kind of out of style.
Well, you wanna talk about mine?
Which one?
Look at this...
What is it?
It was supposed to be two dolphins, but they look like salted anchovies!
You under a spell?
Sorry, I'm not used to it...
To what? Seeing an arse?
Silly...
No, it's cos you did everything.
Well, every now and then you just have to follow your instinct!
What are you doing? You leaving?
Yeah...
Stay a while, we'll have another joint.
No, look... you don't have to say that.
No, I mean...
Look, I'd stay, if it was up to me...
but...
My son's at home. I can't go back with dilated pupils, you know how it is.
I can't go back with dilated pupils, you know how it is.
Ah, OK.
What'll we do? Can I call you?
All right...
I'll see you.
Yeah?
I've got a membership at the Stufe.
-All right... -Bye.
Bye.
-Hey, Peppe. -Hey, you OK?
-Cool. -Hey, Mcintosh.
The pen doesn't work! Some police station, this.
Do they give you toilet paper at least?
No...we bring our own.
I should have known.
DAY 35 OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP
Batman, Perastor,
Barrilbisukseir...
This isn't going to be five minutes! What are we doing here?
Play this over.
Over? OK.
Blusbaispor, Diablaispor, under...
-Aispor? With a T at the end? -No T at the end.
Is it possible we couldn't scrape together 50 euros to go to Florence?
Next time, we'll rob someplace.
Yeah, you!
The most you could rob is the deli!
You'll grab two mozzarellas and four slices of smoked ham.
Shut it or I'll batter you! You're pissing me off!
Oi, guys, keep it down! What's he want? Get out of here!
What's he want? Get out of here!
Come on, keep playing.
-Oh, he's a total loony! -He's got a cue!
A quick move from the right... Straight across... dribbling... Two men on him...
Shoot! Shoot...!
An incredible goal, two minutes from the end. The visiting fans go wild!
...Out to the corner flag, a small advantage for the Azzurri...
There's a banger that took everyone by surprise, including us...
That came from the visiting fan's end. There are smoke bombs as well. And there's another banger.
Naples risking a game behind closed doors.
Which is a shame, as they have an easy run-in to deal with.
Which is a shame, as they have an easy run-in to deal with. There's also a very unpleasant banner declaring "Let's burn the capital"...
There's also a very unpleasant banner declaring "Let's burn the capital"... A stupid banner, this one, not the most sensible thing to do...
A stupid banner, this one, not the most sensible thing to do...
Makes no sense for the team at the top...
Terry!
I'm sorry... You're here?
So are you! Yeah, but I work here.
I know.
I'm gonna go and wash this off me.
Are you leaving already?
What else have I got to do?
What else have I got to do? I wanted to ask you... I mean, invite you...
To yours?
No! Out someplace. To dinner.
There's a place near here where they do really good fish...
-Yeah? -Yeah. I go a lot, they've become friends.
It's fresh stuff.
What do you say? Later maybe, I finish up here soon...
Later maybe, I finish up here soon... if you've nothing on and you fancy it...
All right, but now I'm going for a shower.
I'll wait for you, then? See you later?
I'm warnin' you, they only use plastic plates.
All right, I understand!
-But it's really good. -It's really good. OK...
They've got razor clams to die for.
You like razor clams?
Do I like razor clams? Get out of here, you daftie!
Terry, excuse me a moment.
-What's up? -Just a moment.
Sure.
What the fuck are you lot doing here?
What the fuck are we doing here? We need to go now!
Go where, Barabba?
Did you not hear what happened in Florence?
Yeah, I did.
So we need to go now and kick the shit out of them.
All right, I'll speak to Pechegno.
Talk to Pechegno? What the fuck are you gonna say to Pechegno?
-Tell me what's going on. -Nothing.
-Everything's OK. -Nothing?
You've lost interest in the group, your head's elsewhere, what is it?
I'm fine, Barabba, don't worry.
Right, if you're OK we need to go to these guys now.
We'll go together like we always have done.
Tell me something...me, these guys,
Tell me something...me, these guys, without you, where would we be going?
Are you Mohicano, or not?
OK, wait...
What...?
-Nothing. -Another time?
Yeah, we need to put it off.
All right.
-I'm sorry. -Don't worry.
-You cool? -Yeah. Have fun.
-You cool? -Yeah. Have fun. Yeah, well...
-Bye. -Bye.
Let's go, then, come on.
Oi, wake up!
Wake up, we're here.
My head's sore.
Come on, move, Gabbiano. Look, they're all asleep.
Wake up, guys! Come on!
Come on! We're in Naples, come on!
Come on!
Come on, wake up! Wake the fuck! Come on!
The colour of my heart is white and blue...
God, this guy...
I was born to support you Against the law, stadium bans and repression...
Look at this, what a pussy!
Who is it? NancyB2003, that's old stuff now.
D'you know why she's called Nancy B? You know what B means?
Blowjob!
I'll ask her, is B for blowjob?
Go on, ask her...
Does B...
stand...for...blowjob?
Roma fan, you piece of shit!
Guys, calm down.
You see what we did in Florence?
Yeah?
In Rome we have to be a hundred times worse!
The capital!
Let's burn the capital!
The capital!
Let's burn the capital!
The capital!
Let's burn the capital!
The capital!
Let's burn the capital!
Cool it, guys.
Keep calm.
Hey, Sandro.
Keep calm!  Keep it down, guys! Keep calm.
Relax...
Hey, Barabba.
Get down from there.
Down!
Dickhead, get down.
Hang on...
Get down.
I see you're celebrating.
Well done.
So you do have some fucking balls.
What the fuck is this?
You even have the nerve to come here and celebrate?
After what you did in Florence?
What? You got nothing to say now?
The banner, smokes bombs on the pitch...
And the group knew fuck-all about it.
-Come on, Sandro! -Oi!
Shut it, Gabbiano, you just shut up!
There are people here who've given their all for 30 years!
They've given their whole lives...
body and soul.
Because they believe in this like they believe in God!
We had meeting after meeting to decide...
to avoid being used...
to avoid being labelled...
So what do you lot do today? What?
You chuck it all down the pan!
What the fuck? Have you got any brains at all?
Think!
Decisions are taken together.
Because an ultra on his own isn't worth a fuckin' thing!
You're not worth a fuckin' thing!
You're a nobody!
I'm a nobody.
When I'm on my own, I'm a nobody!
It's when I'm with you, when I'm together with all of you,
It's when I'm with you, when I'm together with all of you, that I feel like a real Apache!
And that's the difference!
It's the group!
Have you understood? Yes or no?
The cat got your tongues, eh?
Go, Mcintosh.
I wanna see those hands, guys!
I went to Mozambique
I went to Mozambique
And I peeled a finger
And I peeled a finger
It got infected
It got infected
I had to get it amputated
I had to get it amputated
Finger!
Finger!
-Leg! -Leg!
You wanna dance a samba? You wanna dance a samba?
You wanna dance a samba?
-Waiter... -Eh?
-Waiter... -What a dick you are!
Here.
Let's try this thing.
Ah, what the fuck! My sweatshirt. Look at this.
What can I do? I've made a mess of myself!
What can I do? I've made a mess of myself! 50 years old and you can't even eat a kebab!
But it'll clean up. Yeah, but I've made a total mess of it.
You were a beast.
Yeah, a beast.
Once upon a time... 20 years ago, maybe.
Look at the mess I made!
Yeah, and I'm the one who can't eat a kebab.
...And the wind howls
On the old terrace, facing the Gulf of Sorrento...
He's got the lighter.
...A man embraces a girl... You all need to chill a bit. I've got my own.
You all need to chill a bit. I've got my own.
When are we goin' for another swim?
Did you eat your sandwich, sonny?
Here you go, Barabba. Cook yourself some mussels tonight.
-Why don't you? -I'm out for dinner tonight.
With her from the baths?
Mohicano's in love!
I really love you...
I really love you... I really love you...
Shut up!
So very much, you know
It's a bond now
Look at your brother!
How's it possible? You're identical. He gets a shag and you don't!
What do you know about shagging? Eat your chips.
-Guys! -Hey, bro'!
Angelo?
He still hasn't appeared.
Angelo!
Angelo! Angelo...!
My pals are calling me, hang on.
Hang on, love, my pals are calling me.
Angelo!
What the fuck d'you want?
Get a move on! You having a wank?
Come on!
-What are you doin'? -Go with your idiot friends!
-Come on... -Get lost!
Gimme five minutes and I'll be down.
Make sure you wipe yourself clean!
Well, guys?
Mum, I'm going out.
Don't be late.
Hey, Chabbù.
You made it.
Quiet, guys. Come here.
Come on, line up here.
First of all I want to thank you all...
because if you're here it means you think the same way as us.
because if you're here it means you think the same way as us. We have the same mentality.
I want to propose a toast...
to the Apache.
Who, unfortunately, are due to retire.
To the Apache, guys! To the Apache!
This isn't a happy day for me.
Because I grew up with the Apache.
They taught me everything, they were like a family to me.
But as happens in every family,
there comes a time when the child has to leave home.
We can't miss the away games, guys...
especially this year when we might win the league.
We're ultras!
We're like an army that defends its standard,
its faith, its city.
We've never been scared of anyone or anything.
And nobody can tell us what we're meant to do.
Because we don't give a fuck!
Today we found out the game will be behind closed doors.
-You know what that means? -That they're scared.
Exactly! They're shitting themselves.
We're going to Rome...
and we're going with our new group which is born today!
Come on, guys!
Listen to me now.
Come over here. I wanna see you all.
The State passed a law
And this is what it tells the cop...
As soon as...
As soon as you meet a fan
Arrest him and bring him here
As soon as he arrives at the station
The cop should be trembling
The law doesn't frighten us
The State won't stop us
In fact we won't stop
The life of an ultra, everyone knows
Only knows two laws...
Consistency and mentality!
-You've never been to Ischia? -No, I haven't.
-That's impossible, it's beautiful. -I've never been!
-That's impossible, it's beautiful. -I've never been! I always went to Procida.
A Neapolitan who doesn't know Ischia...! I just don't...
I just don't... Sorry, are you Mohicano?
Sorry, are you Mohicano?
No, you've got the wrong man.
What d'you mean? Can you take our picture? You too, come.
We're eating, no photos. Take this phone back.
Come on, it's only a photo. What'll it cost you? Two minutes.
Take this back. No photos, I said.
Oi, bro', what did I ask for? A shitty photo!
Take this fucking phone and go. Be good.
Who the fuck do you think you are?
You're a nobody. You're history. You're just an old shit!
You want me to crack your skull, you shit?
You want me to crack your skull, you shit? -I'll make you eat this gun! -Look at this, acting big with a gun!
-I'll make you eat this gun! -Look at this, acting big with a gun!
There are children here.
You're asking for it!
Get out of here! -You got balls? -I'll show you!
-You got balls? -I'll show you! I'll take both of you any time!
You piece of shit!
Get out of here, we're trying to work.
Terry, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.
I used to go to the stadium...
I was part of a group and my past is a bit unusual.
And...?
I really don't care.
Did I ask you who you were?
Did I ask what you do?
-I don't think so. -No.
I don't know if you noticed, but we fucked before we introduced ourselves.
So it's not like we have to go for dinner together.
Why don't you keep all this hassle for yourself?
I promise I'll make it up to you.
Fuck off!
Don't be angry, you're not as pretty.
Give me a smile.
You love me?
You love me...?
No?
You love me?
No...?
I could eat you up.
Why do you have this effect on me?
Get out of here!
I'm totally out of it. Enough.
Who's gonna drive a scooter after this?
They'll take us back.
Look who's here, guys.
Lardarse, we'd lost you! He's totally gone!
That's why we couldn't find him.
He's totally gone...
What is that?
-Give me a drink. -Don't...
What's all this racket?
Bloody hell!
What have you done?
-You want...? -Nah, I'm done in.
-Everything OK, guys? -Yeah...
You ready?
But before we go to Rome we need to do a banner.
Of course.
But that's OK, we've got Giotto here.
Let's be serious, guys, listen to me a minute.
Rome's not a day out.
They need to know the ultras are back.
They need to be scared. They need to be really scared.
And we need to do it for your brother.
Cos I haven't forgotten Sasà.
Fuck do you know about my brother?
Oi, what's wrong?
You offended?
You talk about banners and stuff... Who says we have to go with you?
So you'd rather stay with those four old shits?
The Apache are the history of the ultras.
Without them you wouldn't exist, you know that?
Yeah? The history...
I thought you had balls. Them as well.
-But you're just kids. -Pechegno...
Get out of here!
Bloody kids! Get ou!
Out!
Let's go that way.
-Where are you going? -Come on.
Fiore, hurry up. What are you doing?
Come here!
Can't see dick-all.
Guys, you got another joint? A joint? We're all wrecked.
A joint? We're all wrecked. Look at Lardarse! He looks like Barry White!
Look at Lardarse! He looks like Barry White!
Lardarse, you taking photos as well? You're a mess!
-Bastard! -Shut it!
Are you pregnant? How many months?
Guys, this banner's beautiful.
If we take this banner to Rome, we'll really piss in those bastards' beer!
And they'll tear our heads off if they see the banner.
The problem is we can't go to Rome. -But we need to go... -But why can't we go?
-But we need to go... -But why can't we go?
If the group doesn't come, we can't go on our own.
We need to show Gabbiano and everyone what we're worth!
We need to show Gabbiano and everyone what we're worth! Did you see how they treated us in the gym?
Guys, the banner!
Lardarse, what have you done? Stupid fat bastard!
I wanted to get a photo...
A photo?
Officer, can I say something stupid?
For a game behind closed doors, why do we need to come and sign?
Come on, sign. Bureaucracy, eh?
2-0 for the home side who wanted it over and done with...
DAY 36 OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP
Reggio, it's all wrong.
What are you saying? It's just right.  The colours are wrong.
I'll show you now.
See?
Angelo, come and look, bro'. I think he's right.
Come here and see.
Look at this, at the colours.
It's wrong.
It's blue on the outside and white inside.
Guys, what have we done?
Guys, I told you this was a waste of time!
You bastard! I'm chucking you over!
Oi, cool it!
Hang on, chill!
What are you hitting me for?
I think it might be time to talk to Sandro, no?
So why doesn't this shit go?
You're Sandro's pal, you can sort this out.
I've to look like a dick for this moron?
You're worried about that?
We're fannying about here cos you won't grow a pair!
Angelo, be a man.
Drop dead!
Guys, today we're here again
to show the banned are always here,
even if we have to go and sign at the police station,
we're still here!
Even if the game's behind closed doors cos of some dick!
The real Apache are here, us!
The diehards!
Those who abandoned us along the way can get to fuck!
We don't follow fashions,
We don't follow the masses.
Apache means this as well...
being ultras out of love.
Americà, open this thing, go. Put the banner on the ground.
You not coming? Nah, I'm busy, Mcintosh.
What's this? What have they done?
Who burnt the banner?
Pieces of shit!
Who the fuck...?
Damn you!
What the fuck are you banging for...?
What the fuck d'you want?
I've been looking for you all day.
-I'm busy. -Let me come in.
Come in. Do what the fuck you like, but do it quickly!
Sandro, we need to decide what to do about them.
Mohicano...
we need to decide what to do about them.
I've got people coming to dinner, please.
You're preparing clams?
You're preparing clams? This is what you've got to do?
Let me get this clear. I've to tell you what the fuck I'm doing? Get real!
Sandro, I need to go and smash Pechegno's head in.
He's taking over the group. Come on, Barabba!
They burnt our banner!
You're worrying about hanging up a picture?
Are you serious?
Do you really not get it? What am I meant to get?
At his age did we go to away games? Yes or no?
Did we get into fights? Yes or no?
Did they ban us? So what do you want now? Here it is.
So they can do what the fuck they like?
Sandro, you need to get this woman out your head.
We need to think about counterattacking.
Do you understand? We need to put them back in their place.
Can I tell you something? From the bottom of my heart...
Fighting, counterattacks...
at the age of 50 with that belly, you're still doing this shit?
We're old now. Look at yourself, we're ridiculous.
What have you become? Tell me...
Barabba, you should go. What'll you do if I don't?
-I told you to go! -What'll you do if I don't?
I'm fucking sick of it, do you understand?
-I'll tear your head off! -Hands off!
D'you understand? I'm fucking sick of it!
D'you understand? I'm fucking sick of it! You, the group...
Pechegno and those four kids... all you do is fuck up!
Pechegno and those four kids... all you do is fuck up! And Mohicano has to clean up the mess. I'm fucking sick of it!
Get out of my face! Don't look at me like that! I'm fucking sick of it!
Do you understand? What is it, Barabba?
-Don't touch me. -Bye, Mohicano.
-Love, what's wrong? -Nothing.
It's nice here, ain't it?
You wanna feel me up?
Yeah?
Will you give me a puff? Yeah, you're right.
What's up? Nothing, everything's cool.
It's good shit, this. Where'd you get it?
-You like it? -Yeah.
I'll give you a couple of doobies.
So...you're beautiful, you're nice...
you give me dope... This means you can't cook!
Sure I can! What, you wanna marry me?
You're mad!
-You can answer it. -No...
-Who is it? -How do I know? I'm here.
Who is it? Tell me.
A friend from the gym, I think.
A friend from the gym at 3 in the morning?
You think I came down with the last shower?
Hey, rainman...
we've only just started going out. Did you think I was a virgin?
I'd no doubts there!
-You wanna know who it is? -Yeah.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
He's someone I see occasionally, all right?
"Someone I see occasionally"?
All right... On you go, then. Go!
Go and screw whoever the fuck you like, but get out of here!
-Are you serious? -What the fuck are you laughing at?
Yes, I'm serious! You think I'm mucking about?
You're not normal.
Listen to this! I'm not normal? Cos you are?
You're going out with me and seeing someone else? Fuck off, Terry!
You fuck off! What am I doin' with this troglodyte?
Go and play football with your pals!
I'd do better to be doing that!
Definitely! On you go!
-What a moron! -Get out!
You really did come down with the last shower!
I'm the moron, wasting my time!
Get the fuck out of here!
Dickhead!
On you go, get out of here!
Go and do whatever the fuck you like!
Unbelievable...
Sandro!
Sandro...
You seen Sandro? I've been looking for him all day.
Me too. Tell him not to show his face.
What happened? He just better not show up.
Hey, guys. Angelo.
I've been looking for Sandro all day. I called and he doesn't answer,
I went to his house, he's not there. He's not at Americà's either.
And? Nothing...they were all at Americano's, totally pissed off.
Nothing...they were all at Americano's, totally pissed off.
What? Are we busted? No, no way. But they were armed.
No, no way. But they were armed.
They must think it was Pechegno.
What do we do now?
I think we're still in time. We need to go there.
-Where? -To Pechegno.
Are you mad? They'll kill us.
Angelo, it's done now. You should have thought of this sooner.
All right, you stay here. I'll go on my own.
Where are you going? Come here!
Gabbiano's the hardest.
I'll deal with Gabbiano, don't worry.
I mean it...everyone in front, me and Nano at the back!
Stop Pechegno, but don't touch him. I wanna split his skull.
I'll hold him.
Let's hurt them and not ourselves. So be careful!
There he is. Guys...
Hey, Barabba. Mohicano.
Finish this.
-You came on the bike? -Yeah.
Put a scarf on, it'll be chilly on the bike.
Guys, let's go.
Well, dickhead?
Why did you set fire to the banner?
What banner?
Why did you set fire to the banner?
You piece of shit! I didn't set fire to any banner.
What did you want to prove? That you've got balls?
Yeah? Did you want to prove you've got balls? Yeah...? Arsehole!
Yeah...? Arsehole!
Don't move!
Sandro!
Arsehole! Arsehole...!
Sandro!
Stop, Barabba! Let's go! Go! Boys, out!
Let's go! Go! Boys, out!
Let's go! Go! Boys, out! Come on, guys, out of here!
Sandro!
-Sandro! -What d'you want?
-Sandro! -What the fuck d'you want?
-Stop! -What d'you want?
We set fire to the banner.
And you think I hadn't realised that? Eh?
I wanted to tell you...
What the fuck did you want tell me? That you're a little shit?
Just like your dickhead of a brother!
-Oh, Angiolè! -What happened?
-What did they do to you? -Nothing.
Oi, Sandro!
Sandro!
Oi, what the fuck happened?
It's over, Barà!
If this voice
Wakes you up at night
While you're holding
Your husband tight
Stay awake
If you want to stay awake
But pretend You're sound asleep
You're sound asleep
Don't go to the window
Don't go to the window To take a peek
That voice is mine You're right, it's no mistake
You're right, it's no mistake
The same voice I had back in the days
I had back in the days
When we were strangers
And spoke nice and polite
If this voice
Crying in the night
Wakes your husband
Don't be afraid
Because there are no names
In my serenade
Tell him to sleep
And hat everything's all right
Tell him "Whoever's singing down below
"Whoever's singing down below
Is dying of jealousy
Or totally loco
He'll be crying Over a betrayal or something
Over a betrayal or something
He's singing alone
But who knows why he's singing?"
If this voice Sings to your heart, sweet dove
Sings to your heart, sweet dove
The things I never sought from you
Or told you
All the torment
All the torment Of a lost love
Of a lost love
All the love
Of a past torment...
What have you done? I don't know. It's like a book they've sent me. I don't even know what I'm supposed to have done, now we'll see.
I don't even know what I'm supposed to have done, now we'll see.
-Officer. -Good morning.
And where's your pal this morning? Dunno.
The risk is undervaluing today's game, thinking of next week...
DAY 37 OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP
-Where have you been? -At the stadium.
-I called you six times. -My phone was dead.
When I call, you need to answer me! Who's this dick?
You need to answer.
-What d'you want? -You're fuckin' selfish!
What, now you give a shit about me?
Angelo...
love, what's happenin' to you?
Are you not well?
If you've got problems...
anything at all...
it's just me and you, OK?
You wanna know what the problem is?
The problem is my father doesn't exist.
My brother's dead...
and you've decided to be a mother, but you're not able.
I'm sorry...
Angelo...
Angelo!
-Stay... -Get out of my face!
Angelo... Look, calm down...
Get out of the way, you prick!
Turkey breast, cured ham's good as well.
Ah, OK, I prefer that, let's say...
Yeah, you have to alternate, you can't always eat the same thing.
Yeah, you have to alternate, you can't always eat the same thing. Then for lunch, 50g of rice with a bit of chicken...
Then for lunch, 50g of rice with a bit of chicken...
...banana shake, pomegranate.
-Do you like pomegranate? -Hi, Terry.
It's very good.
Terry, stop, I need to talk to you. D'you know this guy?
Come on, I need to tell you something.
What?
I wanted to apologise.
-Are you done? -Yes.
Fuck off, then.
Here, Fiore.
One game, guys.
Just one more.
And what happens if we win...? God!
Naples'll come tumbling down.
The world'll come tumbling down.
Guys, we have to go to Rome.
Chabbù, oi!
Let's go, what are we doing here?
Oi, guys, you go away! What d'you want?
Chabbù, open up!
We have to take the Via Cassia.
It has to be.
There's no checkpoints there.
OK, Gabbiano, but have you seen how many we are?
OK, Gabbiano, but have you seen how many we are? How can we go to Rome like this?
Bro', if you're scared, stay home!
Angelo, what's this racket?
I need to talk to Gabbiano. Let me in.
Talk to Gabbiano? No one can get in here, guys!
-Let's go. -I have to tell him something!
Do you realise what happened?
So what? I have to talk to him, it's personal.
Angelo, I don't want to hear a pin drop, nobody's to breathe.
-Got it? -Don't worry.
Otherwise you'll drop me in it with him! Get in, move!
And if any of you don't want to come, go now.
Get up and leave.
Because I don't give a damn. But you have to tell me now!
You have to get up and leave if you don't want to come.
I've no problem, I'll go there alone.
-Oh, Gabbiano... -What...?
Look at this.
Chabbù...
who the fuck let these brats in here?
Who? Come on, bro', they're on our side.
Whose side, Chabbù?
Whose?
Get out of here, Chabbù.
What?
We wanna come to Rome. -What? -We wanna come to Rome.
-What? -We wanna come to Rome.
-Why d'you wanna come to Rome? -To avenge my brother.
And how d'you wanna do that?
We'll take blades and knives.
-You got the balls to stab them? -Sure.
Yeah?
Yes, you got them?
Yes.
Is the fat guy coming as well?
Come on...
I can't believe it, come here.
Can you imagine Lardarse in Rome stabbing people?
What is it, Lardarse, you wanna fight with me? Yeah?
Loser!
Oh, what are you mad at?
OK, you can come.
But go away for now. Bye, Gabbiano, thanks.
Idiot!
You see? These kids have more balls than you!
No?
Terry, please, listen to me!
I have to tell you something important!
Shall we go to Ischia? No.
You said you'd never been.
These fuckin' keys, I can never find them...
-Look, I've got the tickets! -No, Sandro, I don't wanna go.
Come on, just a day trip!
I said no. What the hell...?
That's so sore...
You're really stupid putting your foot there!
I thought you saw it!
That I saw it? Why don't you just leave?
Bloody hell, I think it's broken.
But how can it be broken for so little?
I think it is.
What is it?
You're not stupid, you're an arsehole!
Ouch! What...?
What the fuck's that? What is it? What happened?
What's this?
-Pee. -What are you doing?
It's to disinfect.
Don't worry, it contains ammoniac!
Get rid of this, it stinks!
If I had a house here... Yes?
...what life would I have?
At the beach till eight or nine at night.
That's not another life.
This is someone renting a house on Ischia.
Another life...? What would I like?
I'd like to be an astronaut.
I'd go into space, the universe, to discover other worlds...
It's another life! -What a pain! -A pain?
-What a pain! -A pain?
I don't know, Terry, what other life I'd like.
Definitely a quieter one.
I want to risk it... A life beside you, OK?
-A quiet life? -If you say so...!
Come on! -Jump! -Go!
Come here!
-Where are we going, Terry? -This is abandoned.
It's not opening, come on!
What a view!
Since I was a kid I've always wanted a house with a sea view.
Don't! Gross!  What are you doing? You not kissing me?
You won't even kiss me?
Now you kiss me.
-Hi, Sandro. -Hey, Stefania.
-Is Angelo here? -No.
He hasn't been home for two days.
Did he go to Rome?
Stefania, I don't know if he went to Rome.
And to be honest, I don't even wanna know.
OK, I get it, forget it. Goodbye.
Stefà...
I tried my best with Angelo.
He's all I have, Sandro.
Bye.
LAST DAY
Let's burn the capital!
Let's burn the capital...!
Let's burn the capital!
Oi, the cops are here! All together! Come on!
Move!
Come on, move!
Come on, let's get to the Roma fans!
Angelo, you OK?
Let's get out of here! Come with me!
Come with me. Let's get out of here.
This way.
Angelo!
Oi, what the fuck are you doing here?
Come here! Get him!
Stop!
Piece of shit!
Angelo!
Shitty little Neapolitan!
Let's see if you come back to Rome!
Oi, Sandro! Come on, let's go! Move!
Run, Fiore!
It's been such a long time, so long We'll never leave you alone
We'll never leave you alone
We're sons of Vesuvius, the lord
And maybe one day it's gonna explode
A life with you on Sunday at three
I couldn't manage without you, you see
When one day I have to go I'll look down from the sky
I want so many chants at my funeral when I die

Excuse me...
Have you got a light?
Thanks.
It's been such a long time, so long
We'll never leave you alone
We're sons of Vesuvius, the lord

When one day I have to go I'll look down from the sky
I want so many chants at my funeral when I die
It's been such a long time, so long
in Jerusalem on September 30th, 2016.
An event unlike any other since the Jewish state's founding in 1948.
It included presidents and prime ministers, kings and queens,
religious leaders and international dignitaries.
They had all come to attend the funeral of Shimon Peres,
Israel's ninth president, a three-time prime minister,
a Nobel Peace Prize laureate,
and one of the most respected and beloved elder statesmen in the world.
The day before, thousands upon thousands of Israelis young and old,
The day before, thousands upon thousands of Israelis young and old, from all walks of life and backgrounds, also paid their respects.
from all walks of life and backgrounds, also paid their respects.
They had gathered to honor a man
born in a place that few, if any, had ever heard of in Central Europe,
assembled together in a country that did not formally exist
when Shimon Peres arrived on its shores  in 1934.
He was a young firebrand whose visions of the future startled his mentor,
Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion.
A sometimes controversial figure on the political scene,
he was a hawk who built Israel's military and then
he negotiated a peace treaty and became a dove.
Active well into his 90s, Shimon Peres worked not for personal gain,
but to benefit the country he helped to found
and loved until the day he passed away.
Shimon Peres was called a dreamer.
There were times when that description was more of a criticism than a compliment,
but his detractors never stopped him from continuing to dream.
People said that I'm a dreamer.
It's true.
But ask me this: What's wrong?
Who said people who don't dream are right?
[woman 1] The way he lived his life and the choices that he made
based on a notion that dreams are where it starts, you know,
dreams and not fantasies.
[man 1] I think a lot of people sometimes found the scale of the vision too utopian,
but he never meant it to be something that existed only in theory.
For him, it was always about
uniting the theory with a very practical implementation.
[man 2] Shimon was a man of action.
He did not waste time.
In his vision and as a statesman, he did tremendous things.
His original approach to things,
his different approach to things,
he was not like all the others.
He had his own way of thinking.
[man 3] People were always amazed that no matter how old he got,
first, he looked good,
and he stayed young in mind.
Made him young at heart. That's how he kept going.
He was able to just let go  of the most unimaginable disappointments
and the deepest frustrations...
and he never gave up on anybody.
[man 4] I think this is the kind of man that teaches that leadership
[man 4] I think this is the kind of man that teaches that leadership must be optimistic
and think about how to forge a better tomorrow together.
He was constantly
working on ways to improve the life of a lot of people.
There were discouraging moments,
but never to allow the discouraging moments to...
cause him to retreat from doing what he loved to do.
[man 5] I think that fundamental optimism in him
was something that was why, unlike many people
who seem to fade as they get older,
he seemed to constantly draw more energy and...
become more of a magnet.
Including among young people,
as he got older,
because he never lost that quality.
[woman 2] He was gifted with the ability to listen to others
[woman 2] He was gifted with the ability to listen to others who did not share his views,
and still remain determined to find a path forward.
President Peres was all about love and compassion.
He was a giver, not a taker.
[man 6] My father's life was a journey from an old land to a new land.
From an old era to a new era.
Inspired by our prophets, he was a harmony of contradictions.
On one hand, very realistic.
On the other hand, a dreamer.
Being an optimist, being positive, using your imagination,
Being an optimist, being positive, using your imagination, never giving up, always look at the future,
is part of the DNA of his vision.
I don't have patience to sit and watch.
I want to be a participant,
and clearly, in the march to the future.
I don't like to sit on my chair
and wait ten years until something new will arrive.
I prefer to run, to move, to think, to be surprised.
Always be optimistic, but never be satisfied.
Go ahead.
Dream.
[narrator] Shimon Peres was born Shimon Perski
on August 2nd, 1923, in the town of Vishneva,
then in Poland, now a part of Belarus, close to Lithuania.
I was an exceptionally large baby.
I was a sensation, if you want.
I almost killed my mother.
And to this very day, I feel apologetic about it.
But once I was born, the doctor checked me and he said:
But once I was born, the doctor checked me and he said: "This boy doesn't need anything, no vaccination."
I didn't get a vaccination in my life, you know?
Where I was born...
It was a small shtetl, they called it. Small Jewish village.
Something like a thousand souls, probably.
All of them, without exception, Zionist.
And for us, Israel was a dream.
When a package of oranges came from Israel to Vishneva...
it was the greatest event for all of us.
They were beautifully packed
in a sort of a silky Jaffa packing.
And their smell was fantastic.
[narrator] Throughout his childhood in Vishneva,
one of Shimon Peres' biggest influences
was his maternal grandfather, Zvi Meltzer.
A disciple of the legendary rabbinical figure, the Vilna Gaon,
he studied and taught at the famed Volozhin Yeshiva.
[Peres] He was a rabbi.
He knew by heart the Bible, the Talmud, all the others,
but he was also playing the violin.
He took me under his wings.
I think I was the preferred grandchild he has had.
He started to teach me, at the age, probably, of three or four,
every day a page of the Talmud.
He suggested to me to read even Russian literature.
He told me to read The Brothers Karamazov of Dostoyevsky.
There were weeks I couldn't fall asleep,  you know?
Imagine a child reading this terrible book.
[man 2] The second person who very much influenced his early life
was his mother Sara.
She was a librarian and she actually instilled into him
the love for books, for literature.
[Peres] She read in three languages:
Russian, Yiddish and Hebrew.
And she taught us the classics of Yiddish and the classics of Hebrew.
And it was our bread and butter.
[narrator] Following in his grandfather's footsteps,
young Shimon was devoutly religious, far more than his own father.
You know, in the shtetl,
there wasn't electricity.
My father was well-to-do,
so he brought a radio working on batteries.
[narrator] One Saturday, Shimon returned from the Sabbath prayers
to find his father listening to the radio.
I became outraged and I broke the radio.
"How dare do you play on a Saturday?"
[Michael Bar-Zohar] If you want to understand Shimon's character,
you have to go back to when he was four, five.
He came once to his grandmother's home with another child.
The boy was stocky, strong, much stronger than he was.
And they played a game,
one was going to throw the other on the ground.
And the other was stronger, so he threw Shimon on the ground.
Shimon got up and said in Yiddish: "An andere mal,"
"another time."
So they do the second time.
"An andere mal."
Third time, fourth time.
Finally, the grandmother said, "Shimon, that's enough.
He's stronger than you."
And Shimon said, "No, perhaps next time I'll win."
And that's Shimon Peres from then until this very day.
"Perhaps next time I'll win."
[narrator] Shimon Perski had a carefree childhood,
swimming in the Olshansky River that ran behind his house
with his friends and his younger brother Gershon or Gigi, as he became known...
The forests surrounding Vishneva
provided their father, Yitzhak, with a good living as a lumber merchant.
But in the early 1930s, Polish authorities began to levy special taxes
against Yitzhak Perski's lumber business because he was Jewish.
It became almost impossible for him to make a living.
In 1932, he decided he had no choice
but to leave Vishneva for Palestine, Eretz Israel,
where his brother and other family members had already moved.
He would set up a new lumber business there
and send for his wife Sara and his sons once he was making enough money.
Not long after Yitzhak's departure,
a member of the Jewish community was brutally murdered
by an anti-Semitic gang in one of the nearby forests.
And there was a picture of him in the papers.
All of us were alarmed.
[narrator] So alarmed that they decided to leave for Palestine as soon as they could.
A few months later, Shimon, Gigi, and Sara
gathered at the train station outside of Vishneva.
Among those who came to the station to say goodbye
was his grandfather, Zvi Meltzer.
[Peres] He stood aside quietly.
When the locomotive arrived, he came close to me, embraced me,
and told me: "My son, I have just one request from you.
Remain Jewish."
He embraced me, and that was the last time I saw him.
[narrator] Sara, Shimon, and Gigi arrived in Jaffa Harbor
via Istanbul in British Mandatory Palestine
in the summer of 1934.
[Peres] It was like arriving in a different planet, you know?
Nothing was alike in Jaffa and Vishneva.
My father came with a boat, because there wasn't a port, with Arab sailors.
because there wasn't a port, with Arab sailors.
But the first sensation was the sky.
I never saw in my life a blue sky, blue, totally blue,
and the sun, so warming,
and the smell of the oranges, which is like perfume.
People were not dressed as heavily as we were.
They were lightly dressed.
They were sunburned.
They were strong.
And for the first time,
I came to a place where everything was written in Hebrew.
Imagine coming from a place
that you didn't see any Hebrew language
to a place there is only Hebrew languages.
It's like, you know, I was jumping from one world to another world.
I couldn't believe it.
I was reborn.
And I was happy.
That I don't have the words to describe it.
My dream came true,
and the dream was by far more beautiful,
and the dream was by far more beautiful, more fascinating, more optimistic, more than I ever had dreamed.
more fascinating, more optimistic, more than I ever had dreamed.
[narrator] Shimon enrolls in sixth grade at the Balfour School in Tel Aviv.
He immediately stands out among other students,
but for the wrong reasons.
I knew Hebrew perfectly,
but with the Ashkenazi accent.
So a little bit at the beginning, the students were laughing at me.
[Bar-Zohar] He wanted to be a sabra.
He had an accent from which he didn't get rid until today, actually.
And that was the one thing which he didn't like about my biography.
He called me once and he said, "Who told you I have a Polish accent?"
I said, "Shimon, nobody has to tell me that. I hear it."
"You hear it! Who told you?"
Then he met a friend whose father convinced him
Then he met a friend whose father convinced him to go to the agricultural school in Ben Shemen.
And then he saw his life, his future, in agriculture.
He says once he wanted to be a farmer
or a poet to the stars.
[narrator] "The most important service to the people of Israel
is building the country by working the land,"
writes then 15-year-old Shimon Perski in an essay,
"Why I Aspire to Study and Live in Ben Shemen."
"My place is not in the city," he insists,
"but in the village behind the plow, in the field."
He also becomes a leader in one of the most popular Zionist youth movements in the country,
HaNoar HaOved, "The Working Youth."
Shimon's activism soon brings him to the attention
of the chairman of the Jewish Agency, the leader of the Haganah,
and perhaps  the most important figure in labor Zionism, David Ben-Gurion.
[Peres] So, one day I got a message from Ben-Gurion
that he would like to meet me.
He was my hero, but I didn't dream to meet him.
And he suggested that I should join him in his car
And he suggested that I should join him in his car from Tel Aviv to Haifa.
I was very excited.
It was a winterly day.
I came to his place, and I came in the car.
He fell asleep.
There was no end to my disappointment,
because there was no end to my expectations.
Well, when we came near Haifa,
all of a sudden he opened his eyes, looked at me.
all of a sudden he opened his eyes, looked at me. I'm not sure he knew who I am.
He tried to think, "Who is that young boy here?"
And all of a sudden he says:
"You know,  Trotsky was not a great leader."
How did Trotsky enter the car at the last part of our voyage?  I don't know.
[narrator] Ben-Gurion then proceeded to lecture Shimon
on why Trotsky was not as effective a leader as Lenin
because he was unable to make decisions.
At the end of the sentence, he fell asleep,
and that was the end of our trip.
During the evening and night,
the Arabs used to shoot at our village.
We were surrounded all around by Arab villages.
So during the night, I was on the watch.
And that happened to be very near the home of Sonya.
[narrator] Sonya is the daughter of Ben Shemen's carpentry teacher,  Yakov Gelman.
[Bar-Zohar] He saw this girl coming out of the house  with one of the teachers,
and she had this gorgeous Greek profile,
and she was with short pants,
and he looked at her and he fell in love.
And that was total. He was very much in love.
[narrator] October 1939.
The Nazis invade Poland, and World War II begins.
The British government issues a decree known as the White Paper,
strictly limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine,
making it impossible for Jews to flee Nazi-occupied Europe.
David Ben-Gurion proclaims,
"We will help the British as if there were no White Paper,
and fight the White Paper as if there were no war."
For this reason, thousands of Jews in Palestine
soon enlist in the British Army to fight the Nazis.
Among them, Shimon's father Yitzhak, who is soon captured by the Germans.
For most of the war, the family has no idea if he's dead or alive.
While some join the Haganah
and its elite fighting division, the Palmach,
to continue resisting the British mandatory authority,
Shimon and many others choose a different path.
[Bar-Zohar] He didn't want to enlist in the British Army.
There was a slogan in Palestine at that time among the Jews.
"Some to the arms and some to the land."
And he preferred to build the kibbutz they were creating at the time.
Kibbutz Alumot in Galilee.
And that's the time when Sonya, his girlfriend, left him.
She went to British Army.
And he stayed and they separated.
[narrator] January 20th, 1942.
A top secret meeting of high-ranking Nazis is taking place in a villa
a few thousand miles away on picturesque Lake Wannsee, outside of Berlin.
The topic of their discussion: the implementation of what will soon be called
the implementation of what will soon be called The Final Solution of the Jewish Question.
In just a little over an hour and a half, these Nazi officials
formalize the procedures that set up death camps such as
Auschwitz, Treblinka,  Sobibor, and Majdanek
in the systematic murder of millions of European Jews.
Four days later on January 24th,
Shimon leads an expedition of the working youth, which he's organized,
to the ancient fortress of Masada,
the site of the famous First Century Jewish rebellion against the Romans.
The British Mandatory Authority does not want Jews
making pilgrimages to Masada
and has banned Jews from traveling to this area.
So the group is risking arrest.
Their mission is to rebuild the paths going to the top of Masada,
1,500 feet above sea level,
that had been destroyed in an earthquake.
[Peres] We saw some parts of the roads,
and I said: "Look, I think this is the way to the top."
I started going. I made one curve.
I found a connection to the other curve.
When I came to the fourth curve, the curve disappeared.
So I was hanging in the middle.
And stones began to fall, and there was a danger to my life.
[narrator] His friends go into action.
They climb to the top of Masada and make a human ladder,
each person holding the legs of the other
until the last is able to offer his legs to Shimon.
And they started to carry me up to the top.
Needless to say that for a day or two I couldn't walk.
But there we were sitting and learning what happened in Masada.
[narrator] At the very end of their expedition,
the group leaves a parchment scroll for future visitors to see.
It proclaims, "Masada will never fall again."
Eight months later,
Shimon's beloved grandfather, Reb Zvi Meltzer,
along with his grandmother, his uncle, and the remaining Jews of Vishneva,
are rounded up and locked inside the shtetl synagogue,
which is then set on fire.
They're all burned alive.
The Perski family will not learn of their fate until after the war's end.
Shimon quickly becomes a leader at Alumot,
the kibbutz he and his friends are building
on a mountain overlooking the Galilee.
He is elected general secretary and then treasurer.
Shimon Perski also becomes a rising star in the youth movement of Mapai,
the labor party faction under Ben-Gurion's leadership.
He's given an old Triumph motorcycle so he can travel in the Jezreel Valley, recruiting new members,
and spend two days a week in Tel Aviv conferring with party leaders.
At the beginning of 1945,
David Ben-Gurion gives him a special assignment:
mapping and exploring the Negev Desert all the way down to Eilat,
looking ahead to it becoming part of a future Jewish state.
And when we were going, we saw in a very high tree an eagle.
I saw it and immediately climbed the tree.
Its Hebrew name is "Peres."
It was there where I changed my name.
[narrator] Not long after the now Shimon Peres returns to Alumot,
a special guest arrives at the kibbutz.
Sonya, who has finished her British Army service.
He remained in touch with her over the years,
writing letters about Alumot
and the life they were building in the Galilee.
He never gave up hope that they might reunite
and invited her to visit.
The two fall deeply in love once again and resume their relationship.
[Peres] May the 1st... supposed  to be the last day of war, 1945.
And Sonya and myself decided to get married.
In the kibbutz, it was in the open air.
There were hundreds of people coming over from the vicinity.
Kibbutzim and moshavim.
And we were happy.
[narrator] Their honeymoon consists of a few nights  down the hill from Alumot,
on the banks of the Jordan River
in a tent set up as a gift by their fellow kibbutzniks.
Missing from the wedding party is Shimon's father Yitzhak,
who's been found alive in Europe  at the war's end
after escaping several German POW camps.
He is stuck in England
and would return as Sonya and Shimon's  honeymoon was ending.
In the summer of 1946, Shimon becomes a new father
as Sonya gives birth to their daughter Zvia,
who they nickname Zviki.
A few months later,
David Ben-Gurion summons Shimon to Haganah headquarters in Tel Aviv.
The Jewish agency head wants a young man with his leadership skills on staff.
[Peres] And they promised it will be for a year's time.
And I had my... still, my Triumph.
And I was Triumphing on Fridays back home.
But this year lasted 20 years.
[narrator] May 14th, 1948.
Great Britain ends  its mandate in Palestine,
six months after the United Nations passes a resolution
declaring two states in the territory, one Jewish and one Arab.
It also withdraws its troops.
The Jews accept the resolution, the Arabs do not.
Later that day, the Jewish People's Council assembles
and declares the establishment of a Jewish state to be called Israel,
with its capital in Jerusalem.
In the days leading up to these events,
David Ben-Gurion summons Shimon Peres to his office.
[Peres] Ben-Gurion said:
"We are going to have a  war."
And then he took out a piece of paper from his jacket, from his pocket,
and he gave me a list, how many rifles we have, how many...
He says: "With that, we shall lose the war.
Go and do everything you can.
Smuggle, steal, produce, buy.
Everything is permitted."
[narrator] May 15th the following day, as Ben-Gurion has predicted,
the Arab League declares war and attacks the new Jewish state.
[Peres] To our great surprise,
the United States, Great Britain and France
decided to put an embargo on arms against the Middle East,
but the Russians weren't part of it,
so the Arabs continued to get arms, and we were alone.
[narrator] As the war rages,
Shimon Peres becomes one of the key people responsible for ensuring
that the Israel Defense Forces have the weaponry it needs.
[Bar-Zohar] They went all over the world to buy weapons,
to buy planes, even junk,
but everything which could shoot or could be used as a weapon.
They bought in South America,
they bought in Africa, they bought all over in Europe.
And they concentrated all these weapons in secret bases
in France, in Corsica, Italy, and Greece.
[narrator] Despite the arms embargo,
and Israel's numerical disadvantage fighting its Arab neighbors,
the Jewish state emerges victorious
by the time a truce is negotiated to end the war in 1949.
Shimon has been promoted to the position of
assistant secretary of defense for naval affairs.
He's only 26 years old.
Yet despite everything he has done to obtain arms
to ensure Israel's existence,
he finds himself being criticized  by many of his peers.
Unlike them, he has never become a soldier,
although he did decline a commission as a colonel
directly from the Army's chief of staff.
I told him: "Look.
Today, I'm a private. You'll make me a colonel,
I have to salute this... And he will salute me,
and I shall spend time on ceremonies,
and I don't need it."
[Bar-Zohar] Shimon was actually much more important than a soldier and even than a colonel.
He worked with Ben-Gurion, Eshkol, and bought weapons,
and planned the conquest of the Negev,
and was the deputy chief of the Navy.
Because he was doing such an important job,
he didn't think it was important to wear a uniform.
The fact is that if he had just worn  a uniform during the war,
his political career would have been ten-fold easier.
[narrator] In the months following the war's end,
as Shimon Peres continues the search for weapons in the face of the international arms embargo,
he finds himself very frustrated.
He feels constrained by his lack of education.
He has a high rank in the Defense Ministry,
yet he doesn't even have a high school diploma.
[Peres] I came to Ben-Gurion and I said: "Look.
I am ashamed to tell you, but you should know.
I don't know a single word in English."
[Bar-Zohar] And Ben-Gurion said, "Very well. I'll send you to New York
where we have our special mission of producing weapons for Israel.
Most of them illegal, by the way.
And you're going to be deputy director of this mission
and later you'll take over."
[narrator] Sonya, Shimon, and Zviki move into an apartment
on the corner of 95th Street  and Riverside Drive on the Upper West side of New York City.
While he takes classes at The New School for social research
and a special course at Harvard University in advanced management,
his main focus at the Israeli mission offices in Midtown Manhattan
is trying to obtain arms for the Jewish state.
One of Peres' biggest challenges
is trying to bring in desperately needed aircraft in defiance of the embargo.
Working with an aeronautics engineer named Al Schwimmer,
he organizes a group of volunteer mechanics and pilots
to bring these planes to Israel.
They set up shop in Burbank, California,
where they buy fighter planes completely unassembled as surplus parts
to avoid raising suspicion with embargo authorities.
Then the team reassembles the planes and flies them secretly to Israel.
[Bar-Zohar] And Shimon said to Al Schwimmer,
"I hope that one day
we should not have to smuggle old planes from any country,
but to build them alone, to build jets."
[Peres] And Ben-Gurion was visiting America at that time.
We went to Burbank, where the place was,
and he saw small buildings, totally unimpressive,
preparing the planes.
He says: "Impossible."
So, I told him: "Look, if it's possible in Burbank,
it's possible in Israel."
[Bar-Zohar] And he brought Al Schwimmer to Israel and they build jets.
The Israeli Aircraft Industry is what Shimon built together with this guy.
[narrator] 1952.
Prime Minister Ben-Gurion calls Shimon Peres back to Israel.
The director of the Defense Ministry has just resigned
and he wants Shimon to take his place.
Prime Minister Ben-Gurion also chooses Moshe Dayan
as the IDF's new chief of staff.
Peres is delighted.
He has looked up to Dayan since he was a teenager.
During this same period, the Peres family grows by one more
as Yonatan, or Yoni, is born.
But very quickly, Sonya and Shimon are facing a tremendous challenge
when Yoni contracts polio.
It is an especially difficult time for Sonya,
who's not only coping with her son's illness
but very much missing the life she gave up on kibbutz Alumot.
[Bar-Zohar] She was not very happy about his career.
Not at all.
But as long as he was in security, in the Defense establishment,
or working for Ben-Gurion,
that was the holy sacrosanct,
that was important for the country.
[narrator] November 1952.
World War II hero Dwight Eisenhower  is elected president of the United States
World War II hero Dwight Eisenhower  is elected president of the United States in a landslide.
He appoints John Foster Dulles as his secretary of state.
They strengthen the embargo policy against Israel
and focus on closer ties with the Jewish state's oil-rich Arab neighbors.
Shimon Peres' job to find arms becomes that much more difficult.
At the same time, the Soviet Union has become
openly anti-Jewish and anti-Israel,
increasing the quantities of sophisticated arms that's been sent into the Arab world.
Its favorite client state is Egypt, led by Gamal Abdel Nasser,
Its favorite client state is Egypt, led by Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had recently taken power during a military coup
who had recently taken power during a military coup overthrowing King Farouk.
His main passion is to destroy the Jewish state.
He creates units of Palestinian terrorists called Fedayeen, which infiltrate Israel,
attacking both civilian and military targets.
Nasser is also fueling the flames of Arab nationalists
in the French colony of Algeria.
By 1954, with his help,
France and Algeria are headed for an all-out war.
At this moment, Shimon Peres recognizes an opportunity
for Israel's Defense needs that no one else is seeing.
The fact that France and the Jewish state are fighting a common foe.
[Peres] I went to Ben-Gurion.
I said: "I don't know a word in French.
I don't know anybody in France. Let me try my hand."
[narrator] Labor Minister Golda Meir, Foreign Minister Moshe Sharett,
and Israel's UN Ambassador Abba Eban
are convinced that Peres was wasting his time.
[Bar-Zohar] Shimon went to France in spite of all his colleagues,
all the cabinet ministers just laughed at him.
In France, the governments were very weak.
Governments were falling every couple of weeks.
He found out that no matter what the government was,
personal relationships were very, very important.
So he started working very, very... I would say methodically,
meeting members of parliament, journalists,
political figures, generals, Jewish leaders.
[narrator] Early on, Peres befriends France's Interior Minister,
a conservative named Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury,
who's one of the leaders of the movement to fight Nasser
as a means of defeating the Algerian nationalists.
Bourgès then negotiates with Shimon Peres, the first of several agreements
for the purchase of advanced French fighter jets,  cargo planes, light tanks, radar equipment, and cannons.
cargo planes, light tanks, radar equipment, and cannons.
But Shimon Peres does not restrict his contacts to the conservatives.
Another political leader he cultivates
is on the other end of the political spectrum,
Guy Mollet, the secretary general of France's Socialist Party.
The two become fast friends.
As their relationship is developing,
Mollet calls Peres, explaining he has a dilemma.
[Peres] Guy Mollet says:
"Did you hear that I'm an anti-Semite?
There was a fight in the party.
The other candidate was Jewish, so they say I'm anti-Semitic.
Look, the French press is totally against me.
You know, many of them are Jewish people.
Please help me."
I said: "Guy, I don't know anybody among the papers.
I'm a stranger in town."
He says: "Try."
Next week at the greatest magazine of France,
Guy Mollet appeared on the front with a very complimentary portrait.
And he decided that I did it.
He called me up. He says: "Thank you."
I said: "Guy, I don't know anything about it."
Then what happened? Elections arrived.
And who became the prime minister?
Guy Mollet.
[narrator] Joining Mollet's new government as defense minister
is Shimon's other good friend Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury.
[Bar-Zohar] This coalition was marked very strongly
by the will to end the Algerian war, to beat the Algerians,
and Guy Mollet started sending his views on this work.
That was the breakthrough.
[narrator] July 1956.
Nasser seizes the Suez Canal,
jointly built and owned by France and Great Britain.
He also closes the Straits of Tiran,
one of Israel's most important maritime passageways to the world.
French Defense Minister Bourgès-Maunoury
approaches Shimon Peres
to discuss how they can take back the canal and the Straits of Tiran.
Soon, Great Britain becomes involved in the talks,
as does Israeli Army Chief of Staff Moshe Dayan,
who comes up with a plan that France, England,
and Prime Minister Ben-Gurion all support.
Israeli troops will invade the Sinai peninsula,
provoking the Egyptians into battle.
This will give the French and the British a pretext to intervene,
stop the fighting,
and in the process, take back the canal and the Straits of Tiran.
October 29th, 1956.
The campaign that becomes known as the Sinai War begins.
[Peres] It lasted a hundred hours.
That's all.
The Egyptians started to surrender in masses,
thousands and thousands of them.
The victory was brilliant, brilliant.
We achieved all the things.
And from 1956 up to 1967...
no single act of terror.
The Straits of Tiran were open.
It gave us a prestige we never enjoyed before.
[in Hebrew] The dangers to Israel's security have not yet passed.
We must continue the effort of preparing the country to new possibilities.
The Arabs are still holding
sophisticated technology of modern weaponry.
And we need to furnish the Israeli military
with the tools of tomorrow.
[narrator] Shimon Peres knows that Israel has much to gain
by joining with France and England in the Sinai campaign,
but, at the same time, he's also very cognizant
of the great risk the Jewish state is taking.
[Bar-Zohar] He said, "We're going to be hated,  ostracized, and attacked by the entire Arab world.
We need deterrent power."
And they immediately understood what he's talking about.
He had already made some hints before
that he wants to build a nuclear reactor.
[narrator] The French are pioneers in nuclear weapons development.
They are, along with the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union,
one of the world's four nuclear powers at the time.
But they are also spearheading efforts
to harness nuclear energy for peaceful uses,
already supplying France with a significant amount of its electricity
through nuclear power plants they're building throughout the country.
[Peres] Both Ben-Gurion and myself,
we were fascinated by it.
We knew that we are condemned to have a small piece of land,
that we are condemned to have many enemies.
We have nothing of value, neither land, nor water, nor oil,
and here, in our eyes of imagination,
we thought maybe we found a solution to it.
We can be small in land, but great in knowledge.
[narrator] While French Defense Minister Bourgès-Maunoury
and Foreign Minister Christian Pineau
know very well what Shimon is asking for,
there's a huge obstacle in the way of granting him his request.
European atomic energy regulations will not allow France
to sell a non-European country uranium.
So I went to them and I said:  "You know what?
Don't sell us uranium.
Rent us uranium for a while,
and whenever you want, we shall send it back."
Pineau said, "Yeah,that's a good idea. I can live with that."
And that was the very moment
when the nuclear reactor, nuclear power of Israel was born.
[narrator] The idea may have been born,
but Shimon Peres now had to find a way to finance it.
He needs the equivalent today of a half a billion dollars.
A sum that's almost unimaginable in Israel at the time.
Prime Minister Ben-Gurion tells him to see Defense Minister Levi Eshkol.
I went to Eshkol.
He called me "yunger" man,  young man.
"Tell me what you want to do."
I spread before him the map, the plan, the budget.
Then he says:  "Yunger man, so nice of you.
Take my word:
You will never see a penny from me.
Forget it."
He had nobody supporting him. Nobody.
The army said that's crazy.
The head of the Mossad was against him  'cause he was afraid of the Russians.
Yitzhak Rabin said, "With the money
I can create two new armored divisions."
Golda Meir was virulently opposed.
Well, I went to tell Ben-Gurion.
And he says: "What are we going to do?"
So, I suggested to him, "You know what?
Let's try to collect the money outside of the government."
Peres and Ben-Gurion met secretly
with quite a few Jewish millionaires throughout the world.
In Israel, in the States, and other places,
and they were warned:
"If you help us and contribute,
there will be no plaques with your name on the walls of the nuclear reactor.
That's something we should do for the future  of the Jewish people and Israel,
but nobody will say thank you. It's going to be a secret."
And these people agreed and did it.
[narrator] It is decided to build the reactor in Dimona near Beersheba,
an undeveloped area of the Negev Desert.
Far away from population centers and water sources
in case of an emergency.
But towards the end of 1957,
Israel's nuclear program is in danger of being completely shut down.
Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury has been elected France's prime minister
and final approval from his government is needed
to allow the transfer of French uranium to Israel.
Foreign Minister Pineau is now objecting to the deal,
concerned that Israel will use the reactor for defense purposes.
Peres rushes to France
and not only demonstrates that Israel is not developing a nuclear bomb,
he goes a step further, promising to get France's approval
before any weaponizing can take place at Dimona.
[Bar-Zohar] And Pineau says to him: "You convinced me. I agree."
And he writes a letter to the prime minister.
Pineau gives the letter to Shimon,
outlining that he no longer objects to Israel's reactor
and has been assured of its peaceful purposes.
But now time is of the essence in getting the letter to Prime Minister Bourgès.
At that very moment, he's in Parliament,
debating about the future of his government,
which is danger of being brought down by a vote of no confidence.
Peres runs to the Parliament building.
Shimon is waiting outside. It's 4:00 p.m.
And the one of the assistants of Bourgès-Manoury comes to Shimon,
And the one of the assistants of Bourgès-Manoury comes to Shimon, brings him a glass of whiskey.
"The Prime Minister will be here in half an hour now."
So Shimon takes it.
Five p.m., another glass of whiskey.
Six p.m., 8:00 p.m., 9:00 p.m.
Shimon realizes there is no chance
for him to see Bourgès-Maunoury that night,
and a couple of hours later,
a vote in the Parliament, the government falls.
Bourgès-Maunoury is not a prime minister anymore.
Ben-Gurion hears that on the BBC and he writes in his diary:
"Such a pity that Shimon went for nothing to Paris."
The following day, Peres meets with Bourgès-Maunoury  and says: "Why don't we backdate the agreement?
and says: "Why don't we backdate the agreement?
As if it was signed between you and me yesterday when you were still prime minister."
And Bourgès said: "Why not?"
And they faked the document.
I said: "Shimon, how could you do that?"
Oh, he said: "Come on, Michael."
He said: "Between friends, 24 hours. What's the big deal?"
We never take a formal decision to make a bomb.
But I thought for sure that even if we shall not have a bomb,
the image of deterrent was born...
and will serve the purpose.
And it started to have an effect upon the Arabs.
[narrator] In 1958, a new member joins the Peres household.
A brother to Zviki and Yoni,
who Sonya and Shimon name Nehemia, or Chemi,
who Sonya and Shimon name Nehemia, or Chemi, as he is soon to be called by the family.
During this same period of time,
Peres quietly accomplishes another victory for Israel's defense establishment.
He negotiates a top secret deal with West Germany
to supply sophisticated weapon systems at no cost,
as part of its ongoing war reparations program for the Jewish state.
That is the kind of side result, not that pleasant.
Golda Meir, she was the minister of foreign affairs,
she cried: "Why does he do that to me?"
Because she felt that he was taking her job.
But that was Shimon.
He was creative. He was thinking all the time.
"Who can help?"
Golda did not very much understand Europe, and Shimon did.
Shimon did.
[narrator] In the summer of 1963,
77-year-old David Ben-Gurion resigns as prime minister
and retires to his kibbutz, Sde-Boker.
Levi Eshkol takes his place.
Shimon is asked to stay on in his role as deputy defense minister.
May 1967.
Nasser shocks the world
by sending a massive number of armored divisions into the Sinai,
and orders UN peacekeeping forces to leave.
He also closes the Straits of Tiran.
For some eleven years, Israel's southern border has been quiet.
But it is becoming increasingly apparent that war is on the horizon.
Tensions increase after a national radio address by Prime Minister Eshkol,
in which he comes off as weak and indecisive.
A group in the Knesset led by opposition leader Menachem Begin
demands that Eshkol resign
so that a stronger war leader can step in as prime minister.
But Eshkol refuses to heed their call.
So Shimon Peres and others
push him to relinquish his other position as defense minister
in favor of former Army Chief of Staff Moshe Dayan.
Realizing he's fighting a losing battle, Eshkol reluctantly gives in.
Peres is asked to deliver the news to Ben-Gurion,
who's still insisting that Eshkol resign as prime minister.
[Peres] I came in.
I told Ben-Gurion the whole story.
Ben-Gurion became angry and he says: "I thought you are my friend.
You are not.
I thought you are a great statesman.
You are not.
I thought I can rely upon you.
I can't."
But what can I tell you?
The nature of the crisis I went through and the nerves.
And it looks like I lost everything.
[narrator] At this point, Shimon feels he has no choice
but to stand up to Ben-Gurion.
He tells his mentor that continuing to criticize Eshkol
is not in Israel's best interest at such a crucial time.
The old man is taken aback by Shimon's challenge,
but then he thinks for a few moments.
"You know what?" he replies. "You're right."
That evening, Ben-Gurion calls a meeting of his supporters and addresses them.
And he says: "I knew many people
that never think of themselves."
And he came, embraced me,
and then he says:
"But there is nobody like Shimon."
[narrator] June 5th,1967. The Six-Day War breaks out.
When the fighting is over, the West Bank of the Jordan River,
the Golan Heights, the Sinai, the Gaza Strip,
as well as the old city of Jerusalem, are all in Israel's hands.
After the sudden death in 1969 of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol,
who forged a new relationship with the United States
as Israel's strategic partner and arms supplier,
Golda Meir is chosen as Israel's fourth prime minister.
She leads the newly formed Labor Party to victory in national elections later that year.
Despite a long, rancorous relationship with Shimon Peres,
Prime Minister Meir selects him to be a minister without portfolio in her new cabinet.
It is not out of a newfound sense of appreciation for him.
Rather, Moshe Dayan,  Israel's most popular political figure,
makes it clear that if he's going to remain as minister of defense,
he wants Peres in the cabinet as well.
But "minister without portfolio" is a misnomer for Shimon Peres.
Moshe Dayan put him in charge of developing the West Bank in Gaza.
And then Golda, impressed with what he accomplishes,
gives him the ministries of absorption, transportation, and the post office.
Soon, Peres is at work building an international university, new housing,
an international university, new housing, and settling immigrants in Israel's growing capital city of Jerusalem.
He pioneers the country's freeway system
and modernizes its aging train service.
And while he oversees the construction of new Jewish settlements in the territories,
he also initiates projects in the West Bank, in Gaza,
to improve living conditions in the refugee camps,
and builds industrial parks to provide work for the Palestinians.
Summer 1973. Moshe Dayan and the IDF's high command
begin receiving intelligence reports about Egyptian and Syrian troop movements
begin receiving intelligence reports about Egyptian and Syrian troop movements on its borders,
but the defense minister and the generals do not believe an attack is imminent.
It's a fatal miscalculation.
On Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year,
a coalition of Arab armies led by Egypt and Syria
take Israel by surprise, assaulting it from all sides.
Despite heavy early losses
by the Yom Kippur War's end some three weeks later,
Israel has completely turned the situation around.
The Egyptian Third Army is surrounded.
The IDF has moved deep into Egypt and Syria,
approaching both Cairo and Damascus.
President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
insist that Israel halt its advance and a ceasefire is called.
But unlike 1967,
when people were celebrating Israel's victories in the streets,
this time the mood of the country is glum.
Almost everyone knows a family whose son has been killed or injured.
The national psyche is damaged, and Israelis are angry at their leaders.
[Peres] I think Dayan was a great soldier.
He made a terrible mistake.
We went together to visit the tombs of the soldiers.
It was one of my worst days in life.
The families of the fallen soldiers spit at him.
They called him "Traitor! Shame on you."
[narrator] A few weeks later, on December 1, 1973,
David Ben-Gurion dies at the age of 87.
Shimon Peres is summoned to the hospital when he's dying.
I saw this lion...
lying like a dead person.
Look, for me you can imagine what it meant.
All my life I admired him.
I thought the man is innocent.
He's not cynical.
He can shout. He can fight.
Never bluff, never lie.
My relations with him were lonely.
I never participated in big parties, in big occasions.
Just when I have had something, I came to him.
He would listen to me carefully,
say yes or say no, usually yes.
And I would go and do it.
He trusted me.
[narrator] On April 10, 1974,
after months of protest  by thousands of Israelis over who was to blame
after months of protest  by thousands of Israelis over who was to blame for the surprise attack on Yom Kippur,
Prime Minister Meir makes the following statement:
"I am resigning.
I cannot carry the burden anymore.
I've reached the end of the road."
An unexpected candidate emerges to replace Mrs. Meir.
Former IDF Chief of Staff and Israeli Ambassador to the United States,
Yitzhak Rabin.
Having not served in Golda's cabinet,
he's considered free of the taint of the Yom Kippur War debacle.
She and others in the Labor Party establishment
decide to support his candidacy.
But then Shimon Peres shocks everyone when he makes the surprise announcement
that he too is going to run for the premiership.
Yitzhak Rabin, who's never forgiven Shimon  for not wearing an Army uniform in 1948,
is furious and questions his right to run.
The Labor Party election takes place less than two weeks  after Golda's resignation.
Shimon is expected to get no more than 30 percent of the vote,
but then he astonishes everyone and wins almost 47 percent,
losing to Rabin by only 44 ballots.
As the number two in the party,
Peres insists upon being given the Defense Ministry,
something which Rabin resists.
But when it's made clear to him
that his chances of forming a ruling coalition
and becoming prime minister
depend on Shimon being given his cabinet position,
he reluctantly gives in.
Shimon Peres, who's been one of the key people responsible for building Israel's security establishment,
is finally at its helm.
[Peres] It was a Sunday,
and I got a note that a French plane was hijacked
and among the passengers
are over a hundred Jewish people.
[narrator] The hijackers, two Palestinians and two Germans,
force the pilots to fly to Entebbe Airport in Uganda.
The plane is greeted by the country's leader, Idi Amin,
who is more than happy to allow it to land at Entebbe
and do the terrorists' bidding.
He stood before us with his Army uniform.
He had the Israeli paratrooper wings
and he said to us in English: "Maybe you know me.
I am Field Marshal Doctor Idi Amin Dada,
the president of the Republic of Uganda."
[narrator] Amin is wearing those wings
because he had done military training in Israel in the 1960s,
but he's turned against the Jewish state
and is now allied with the Palestinian cause.
[Peres] The hijackers, the terrorists--
Two of them were Germans--
went through all the passengers, asked them if they are Jewish or not.
Non-Jewish? Go out. Jewish? Stay.
You know, for me, it was a terrible shock.
It was a small holocaust.
They are going to decide whom to kill and whom not.
And I thought:  "We have to do whatever we can."
[narrator] First the hijackers release a list of terrorists
being held in Kenya, Germany, France and Israel,
demanding that they be released.
Then they order that the prisoners be freed within 36 hours,
otherwise they'll start executing the hostages.
In Jerusalem, the Rabin government begins weighing its options.
The prime minister thought since we don't have any other option
and the families of the persons that were hijacked started to call upon him to save their lives,
so he tended to accept the conditions.
I came to him and said:  "Yitzhak, it's a mistake."
[narrator] The prime minister angrily challenges Peres,
asking if he has a better plan.
Shimon and the IDF Chief of Staff Motta Gur,
have been looking at Israel's military options almost since the crisis began,
but their initial ideas have been quickly rejected by Rabin as not feasible.
In the meantime, a group of young officers organized themselves,
In the meantime, a group of young officers organized themselves, said they had an idea of their own.
I saw the boys.
Unbelievable. Courageous. Wise. Experienced.
And they say it's possible.
I went to the prime minister.
I said: "I would like to try to work with this group of people
and see if we can find a solution."
[narrator] But Rabin is still skeptical.
Shimon Peres, Motta Gur, and their special team
go into high gear to finalize a military plan
that will meet with Prime Minister Rabin's approval.
Twenty-four hours later, a viable course of action  is coming together.
That Sunday, July 4,
the IDF will fly in an elite force of commandos to Uganda,
as Idi Amin will be out of the country at a conference of African states.
Hercules troop carriers will fly from Israel and land in Entebbe
will fly from Israel and land in Entebbe
as if Idi Amin is returning home from the conference he's been attending.
A black Mercedes limousine exactly like Amin's
will then drive out of one of the Hercules
with an Israeli soldier inside disguised to look like the dictator,
surrounded by elite Israeli commandos,
also made up to look like Ugandan soldiers.
The commandos will then take the hijackers by surprise, overpower them,
and rescue the hostages,
getting them on the Hercules and spiriting them back to Israel.
On Saturday morning, July 3,
Chief of Staff Gur phones Peres to report that
an airborne run-through with the Hercules planes has succeeded.
[Peres] That impressed Rabin.
And we decided we do it.
[narrator] Peres and Gur make their way to the airfield in Tel Aviv,
where the planes and soldiers are getting ready for the mission.
The lead commando, 30-year-old Yonatan Netanyahu,
approaches Peres and shakes his hand,
stating that the plan is 100 percent.
Shimon embraces him.
And then he, along with the rest of the commandos,
board the planes and leave on their mission.
[reporter] It was one week almost to the minute
after they'd taken off on their ill-fated flight to Paris,
that the crew and remaining passengers landed back on Israeli soil.
It was, coincidentally, at the exact hour
at which the hijackers' ultimatum to the Israeli government  was due to run out,
and the hostages had been warned by their captors that they would die.
[reporter 2] What made you think that Israel  could pull off an operation like this?
The alternative.
[Peres] People attribute much to luck.
Luck is important.
But what we call luck is actually courage.
You have to take risks,
and you cannot say,
"The risk I'm taking is to have luck."
You have to prepare very carefully
that you will not depend  upon the luck.
[narrator] While the Hercules are in the air
and the commandos are on the ground in Entebbie,
the entire operation unfolds in complete radio silence.
[Peres] And on Saturday night,
the silence was broken.
The Chief of Staff Motta, called me up and said:
"We lost one of our fighters."
And that was Yoni Netanyahu.
I almost cried.
But what can I do?
The father of Yoni came to me and he said:
"I have one request.
I want that you will eulogize him."
[Peres in Hebrew] Thanks to the few, many have been saved.
And thanks to the one fallen,
new stature has been revived.
And about him, and them,
it can be said in the words of King David:
"Swifter than eagles, stronger than lions, Yonatan on the altar has fallen."
I am sorry for you, my brother Yonatan.
You were to me very pleasant. Your love was wonderful.
[man 7] I first met Shimon at my brother's funeral,
at my brother's grave, when he delivered this inspiring eulogy.
He spoke about him in such... moving terms and also in historical terms that...
it just mesmerized me and my family.
And that created a bond that lasted throughout the rest of Shimon's life
and which I never forgot. Never.
[Bar-Zohar] All the credit for the Entebbe operation goes to Shimon,  not anybody else.
And that were the words of the Chief of Staff of the Army Motta Gur.
The night of the raid, said: "All the credit must go to somebody,
to one man who pushed up and pushed down, and did not rest,
to one man who pushed up and pushed down, and did not rest, and did not stop until he achieved this operation,
and this is the Minister of Defense, and we owe him all the credit for that."
[narrator] April 1977.
Prime Minister Rabin shocks the nation, resigning after the news of a financial scandal
involving an illegal foreign bank account belonging to his wife Leah.
Shimon Peres becomes acting prime minister
and is selected as the Labor Party's candidate
for the election scheduled five weeks later.
Running against him is the perennial leader of the opposition,
Likud Party head, Menachem Begin,
who many initially give little chance of defeating Peres.
However, a series of other corruption scandals within the Labor Party
also begin dominating the news.
Shimon soon finds himself fighting an uphill battle.
[in Hebrew] Well... it seems... No less than an upheaval.
[narrator] Begin outpolls Peres by almost nine percent of the electorate,
ending three decades of Labor Party rule in the Knesset,
and the Prime Minister's Office.
It is a humiliating defeat for Shimon.
Shimon Peres buries his disappointment over losing the Prime Minister's Office
Shimon Peres buries his disappointment over losing the Prime Minister's Office to Menachem Begin
by becoming a vociferous leader of the opposition in the Knesset.
This is especially the case during the 1982 Lebanon War,
which becomes one of the most controversial in Israel's history.
[Peres] We were attacked from Lebanon
by the PLO and Hezbollah.
Most of the attacks were done by mortars at the range of 40 kilometers.
Begin told me that we will not go further than 40 kilometers,
the range of the mortars.
It won't take more than four days.
I told him: "Look, if it's four days, 40 kilometers,
and if the purpose is to bring an end to the attacks upon us, I'm for it."
[narrator] Peres travels to the battle zone as a show of support for the troops and the aims of the mission.
He visits his son Chemi, a helicopter pilot
flying in some  of the heaviest battles of the war in Damour,
one of the main terrorist bases in Lebanon.
But as Operation Peace for Galilee expands to bombing Beirut,
Peres' views begin to change.
He becomes one of its most vocal opponents,
even clashing with Yitzhak Rabin,
who supported the siege against the PLO in Beirut.
Public opinion also begins turning against the war
after Israel is blamed for a Christian militias' massacre
at two Palestinian refugee camps  outside of Beirut.
This leads to an Israeli government inquiry
and the resignation of Ariel Sharon as defense minister.
Emotionally and physically drained by what has become a disaster in Lebanon,
and then the death of his wife Aliza,
Menachem Begin resigns as prime minister in September of 1983.
His successor is the new head of the Likud, Yitzhak Shamir.
The former leader of the Stern Gang,
one of the most extreme pre-Israel underground movements,
he also opposed the Camp David Accords
from the time of Anwar Sadat's historic visit to Jerusalem in 1977.
Known for being a man of few words,
Shamir is not a skilled politician like his predecessor,
and he soon finds himself overwhelmed
by the myriad of problems Israel is facing:
the continuing war in Lebanon,
the deepening tensions with the Palestinians,
and an out-of-control inflation rate
that's threatening to destroy the economy.
July 1984. New elections are called,  Labor emerges the victor.
[Peres] I got 44 mandates.
The Likud, headed by Shamir, had 41.
I had a majority.
But I didn't have a majority to build a government without him.
So we suggested: "Let's have a government based on rotation."
For the first 25 months of this national unity government,
Shimon Peres will serve as prime minister,
and Yitzhak Shamir will be deputy prime minister and foreign minister.
The subsequent 25 months, the positions will be reversed.
[in Hebrew] All the best. Go get some rest. It's time, after all.
Well, I have two years for that.
[narrator] Shimon Peres is formally sworn in as prime minister  on September 13, 1984.
After fulfilling his first campaign promise,
to withdraw Israel's troops from Lebanon,
Prime Minister Peres takes on Israel's disastrous economy.
The country's inflation rate is one of the highest in the world
with some economists warning Peres that it could surpass 1,000 percent.
Investors are fleeing the country's industries.
Prices in Israeli stores are being raised every day.
I'd like to see how you're able to provide for a family of four or six people!
Peres brings together a task force of scholars and economists
which devises a plan that involves severe cutbacks
which devises a plan that involves severe cutbacks from every sector of society.
[Peres] I called in a Cabinet session
that lasted for 36 hours.
And I cut from everybody.
And I cut 500 million dollars from Defense.
That was the largest cut in the history of Israel.
Then I cut from Education.
The minister of Education was my best friend.
It was the end of the friendship.
All ministers agreed to the cuts of other ministries.
None of them agreed to cut his own ministry.
But I said: "Gentlemen, either you take it or I leave you."
In 36 hours, whoever closed his eyes for a moment, I cut his budget.
I was criticized from one end to the other end.
But to my great surprise, the tougher I was,
the more insistent I became,
I noticed there is a change in the public opinion.
Day to day, my polls went up,
contrary to all of the predictions.
In a matter of six weeks, the inflation started to go down.
[narrator] Israel's inflation rate drops from almost 500% a year to 16%.
Prime Minister Peres' approval rating surpasses 70%,
the highest ever recorded.
He's due to swap roles in October 1986 with Deputy Prime Minister Shamir.
[Bar-Zohar] And there were some people, including yours truly,
would try to influence him to break the rotation,
to go for new elections.
He was so popular. It was 80% popularity.
Stop it! Go to elections!
I told them:  "Gentlemen, I gave my word.
I'm not going to change."
I knew, from experience and otherwise,
if you don't keep your promises, you will never be a leader.
[narrator] On October 20, 1986,
Yitzhak Shamir is sworn in as prime minister.
Shimon Peres becomes deputy prime minister and foreign minister,
and he quickly focuses on a new goal,
a peace treaty with Jordan,
and with King Hussein's assistance,
a solution to the ongoing conflict with the Palestinians.
[Peres] What was the idea?
That we shall have three entities:
The Jordanian Kingdom, the State of Israel,
and the West Bank that was under the Jordanian rule.
The West Bank will be not really completely independent,
The Jordanian king and our government
will manage together the West Bank.
Whoever lives in all those places,
if he's Israeli, he will vote for the Israeli Parliament.
If he's a Jordanian, he'll vote for the Jordanian Kingdom.
Everybody can move to wherever he wants.
There wouldn't be any problem  of settlements,
there wouldn't be any problem about holy places,
because it's open.
[narrator] In a historic speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations,
Shimon Peres offers to enter into direct negotiations with the Hashemite Kingdom.
The speech is received positively and initiates a secret dialogue
between King Hussein and Peres, supported by the United States.
April 1987.
The king and Shimon Peres are on their way  to a clandestine meeting in London.
Prime Minister Shamir refuses to take the meeting seriously.
"Why is Shimon doing this?" he remarks. "Nothing will come of it."
The meeting is facilitated by a prominent member of London's Jewish community, Victor Mishcon,
who is friendly with King Hussein
because their children are going to school together.
[Peres] We met on a Saturday morning
at the home of Mishcon.
Lady Mishcon sent all the staff out.
She prepared herself the lunch,
the dinner, the breakfast,
without any servants.
[narrator] The talks go on throughout the day.
After Mrs. Mishcon prepares dinner for the group,
the king and Peres take an unusual break from the talks.
The king said:
"Mrs. Mishcon is working so hard.
Let's the two of us go and wash the dishes,"
to which I agreed quickly.
[narrator] After another two hours of discussion,
the king and Shimon are in full agreement on the major points of what will soon be called
on the major points of what will soon be called The London Agreement.
Peres immediately returns to Israel so he can meet with Prime Minister Shamir
and apprise him of the historic agreement.
[Peres] When we met on Sunday,
I read the agreement in the ears of Shamir.
Quiet. He didn't answer.
But the next day, without my knowledge,
he sent one of his ministers to George Shultz,
the secretary of state of the United States,
and said that he's against the agreement.
Shultz was under the impression
that this was an agreement so comfortable for Israel,
the best we could have.
All of a sudden he says:
"Well, I can't split  the Israeli government."
And I lost.
[narrator] King Hussein is so angry about the collapse of the London Agreement
that he tells the Israelis:
"If you want to make peace, go to the Palestinians.
I'm washing my hands of this."
It was the best agreement Israel has had.
Even the Likud party members said
that the London Agreement was the best we ever had,
that the London Agreement was the best we ever had, we ever could have.
[Bar-Zohar] If this London Agreement had been carried out,
no Hamas, no Fatah, no Palestinian Authority.
We could have a different world.
[narrator] The final 18 months of the National Unity government
are painful for Shimon.
He and Shamir are constantly at odds.
Eventually the two men stop speaking.
[Peres] And he, by definition,
was a very intransigent gentleman.
He looked upon us-- We were younger than him--
as people in a hurry.
"You, the people with impatience,  always in a hurry."
[narrator] November 1988.
Yitzhak Shamir becomes prime minister in a new National Unity government.
Peres is given a minor Cabinet position.
By 1990, he is out of the government after a failed attempt
to bring a no-confidence motion against Shamir.
As the Palestinian uprising, which became known as the Intifada,
rages throughout the West Bank,
Peres is sitting as an opposition back-bencher in the Knesset.
He places the blame for the violence on Yitzhak Shamir's rejection
of the London Agreement in 1987.
February 1992.
The bitter rivalry between Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres once again erupts.
Rabin challenges Peres for the leadership of the Labor Party.
He ends up garnering almost 41% of the vote to Shimon's 35%.
That June, Yitzhak Rabin,
who'd resigned in disgrace as prime minister in 1977,
wins overwhelmingly in his return to the office.
[in Hebrew] I will be leading.
I will determine who will be ministers. [narrator] Rabin and his supporters have very little interest
[narrator] Rabin and his supporters have very little interest
in giving Shimon any sort of prominent role in the government.
However, since Peres has won more than a third of the Labor vote,
Party leaders pressure Rabin into giving him his former post as foreign minister,
but the prime minister curtails or diminishes many of his responsibilities.
At the beginning, Shimon Peres was nothing in the Cabinet.
They tried to stop him.
To besiege him from all sides.
Another one of the entourage of Rabin said:
"He's going to be minister for cocktails."
[narrator] But Peres, once the little boy who kept getting back up
after being knocked down, saying: "Perhaps next time I shall win,"
remains determined.
Quietly, he starts down a path
that will alter Israel's relationship with the Palestinians
and shake up Middle East politics forever.
Since the failure of the London Agreement,
Shimon has never given up on the dream
Shimon has never given up on the dream of peaceful co-existence with the Palestinians.
US-sponsored talks between Israel and Palestinian groups,
which excluded the PLO, had fallen apart.
Seeing that no one in the Palestinian world
is willing to make a move without first getting permission from Yasser Arafat,
Peres concludes that Israel has no choice but to negotiate directly with the PLO
if it's going to make peace.
All of my friends in the government said:
"Not Arafat. He is a terrorist."
And I said: "You have somebody better?
You have somebody else?"
Members of Peres' inner circle reach out to Abu Ala,
the PLO's finance minister,
a close associate of Yasser Arafat and a moderate.
With the help of a Norwegian diplomat friendly to both sides,
they begin a series of secret peace talks in Oslo, Norway.
[Peres] So, I went to Rabin and I told him, "Look, here is a man
who can make decisions.
I want to continue."
[narrator] While he is skeptical about the chances of the talks succeeding,
Rabin allows them to continue.
He also permits Peres to send Uri Savir,
the director general of the Foreign Ministry,
to join the talks.
Abu Ala and Uri Savir begin to make progress
on a declaration of principles that calls for Israel and the PLO
on a declaration of principles that calls for Israel and the PLO to mutually recognize one another.
Give the PLO control of Gaza and Jericho
and set benchmarks for the final status of East Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees,
but there's a big obstacle complicating their work.
[Peres] Arafat is not a simple personality, so to speak.
Without him, we couldn't start,
but with him, it was almost impossible to conclude.
Whenever Abu Ala informed him
that they achieved everything,
Arafat said: "No, no, no."
He wanted to show that he is the man that decides.
[narrator] In mid-August, at a celebration marking his 70th birthday,
Shimon reveals to a small circle of friends
what has been taking place in Oslo.
He explains to the surprised group,
"I've devoted most of my life to Defense.
What is left for me now, after we've built a strong Israel,
is to bring peace to our young generation."
[Bar-Zohar] The moment the nuclear reactor was built and Israel became strong,
and actually invincible because of that,
we felt that we can today become much more generous toward our neighbors,
find a way to make peace with them.
[narrator] Shimon is about to start a long-planned diplomatic tour of Scandinavia.
He decides to use this opportunity
to personally try concluding the negotiations,
which he worries are becoming hopelessly delayed by petty arguments and trivial details.
[man 8] We reached Oslo, and we called the Norwegian foreign minister
to spend the night with us,
and we used that night actually negotiating through the telephone
and we used that night actually negotiating through the telephone with the mediation of the Norwegians,
on the other side was Tunis,
in order to overcome the very last disagreements.
[Peres] Some of them were overwhelmed.
Some of them were angry.
I could hear it on the phone.
I could hear the voice of Yasser Arafat.
I mean, they were so excited.
[narrator] Peres immediately phones Prime Minister Rabin
and informs him that an agreement has been reached on the declaration of principles.
At 2:30 that morning,
the two delegations arrive at the royal guesthouse in Oslo,
greeted by the Norwegian foreign minister and Shimon Peres.
It is the first time that Shimon and Abu Ala are meeting in person.
[Peres] He asked to see me privately,
and he burst in tears.
He said: "You must understand
we are the only people that don't have anything.
For us, this is the first time to be recognized.
And not by Arabs but by Jews."
[narrator] Peres then flies to the United States
to meet with US Secretary of State Warren Christopher
to outline what has been accomplished in Oslo.
After President Bill Clinton is briefed,
it is decided that a signing ceremony will take place in Washington, DC.
But first, Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres
have to sell the Cabinet on approving  the agreement.
Despite being stunned by what they are hearing about Oslo for the first time,
all the ministers, except for one, vote to approve the accords.
[Bar-Zohar] Rabin went all the way to stand behind  and support Shimon in this move.
What these two men finally found out
was that even though they would fight between them,
the moment there was a question  of national importance,
these two guys will sit together and all of a sudden,
a kind of metamorphosis.
They would work together, understand each other, help each other.
There was a, I would say, a cooperation, a harmony between them,
which was unbelievable.
[narrator] The focus is now on the September 13th signing ceremony on the White House lawn.
However, behind the scenes, leading up to the event,
drama is once again unfolding.
[Peres] Rabin refused to shake the hand of Arafat,
"I don't want to shake his hand. He's a terrorist."
Then Clinton intervened.
He said: "How can you come
and not shake the hand of your partner?"
And then he took the two of them, almost forced them,
and Rabin shook the hand of Arafat.
Then he called me and he said:
"Now it's your turn."
[man 3] The thing that struck me was, when we got to the end,
it was clear to me that Rabin trusted Peres
and what he was trying to do at Oslo.
Peres was just so comfortable and confident...
that he tended to calm things down,
tended to make people believe that,
yes, there are all these unanswered questions
and yes, we used to fight, and yes, we used to argue,
but we have decided for peace.
Now we have to decide the details.
It seems so simple now.
It wasn't. I mean, they both knew
that the extreme opponents of this agreement
would try to, at a minimum, hurt them politically
and maybe more.
[narrator] Almost immediately after returning home from Washington,
Peres suggested to Prime Minister Rabin
that the time is now ripe to forge a treaty with King Hussein.
[Avi Gil] He told Rabin: "We have to storm into Jordan...
in a peaceful way."
And we spent a day and a half in Amman secretly.
We crossed the river disguised.
Peres with a wig and a mustache.
After a day and a half of discussions with the king,
his brother Crown Prince Hassan, and the Prime Minister Majali,
we've reached four or five pages  of detailed agreement,
which is the basis of the later on peace agreement
which is the basis of the later on peace agreement with Israel and Jordan,
and the King and Peres initialed this document.
[narrator] The king asks that the agreement  be kept completely secret for the time being.
Elections are upcoming in Jordan,
and the popularity of the Muslim Brotherhood is on the rise.
Hussein has concerns that news of the treaty might sway the outcome.
But when Shimon is seen crossing back into Israel,
no longer wearing his disguise,
the speculation starts about why he was in Jordan.
Then he makes a careless remark in front of journalists before a radio interview.
They put two and two together and report that he and the king have met.
Hussein is furious and refuses to meet with Peres any longer.
Yitzhak Rabin is more than happy to exclude his foreign minister from the final talks.
Taking center stage and finishing the work Shimon Peres initiated
as the treaty is formally signed in July 1994.
There was a time when war was fought for lack of choice.
Today, it is peace, is the "no-choice" option for all of us.
[narrator] Whatever tensions there might have been between the two men
over the Jordanian peace talks,
they were all smiles in December 1994,
as they, along with Yasser Arafat,
traveled to Oslo to accept the Nobel Prize for Peace.
The dream of peace represented by the Oslo Accords
is soon facing serious challenges.
Many were hoping that Arafat would grow into a similar kind of peace partner
as Anwar Sadat or King Hussein,
but less than a year after Oslo was signed,
growing numbers of Israelis are becoming convinced that he is unable or unwilling
growing numbers of Israelis are becoming convinced that he is unable or unwilling to give up terrorism.
After signing the May 1994 Gaza/Jericho Agreement,
that is part of the Oslo Accords,
Yasser Arafat arrives in Gaza  to start the process of governing,
but hidden in the vehicles of his motorcade
are weapons and terrorists he's allowed to be smuggled
into the newly proclaimed Palestinian Authority.
Throughout the fall of 1994 and well into 1995,
terrorist attacks erupt against Israelis by Hamas,
an Islamic fundamentalist Palestinian group founded in the late 1980s,
and another group, the Islamic Jihad.
Israelis now take to the streets to protest against the Oslo Accords,
aiming much of their fury at Prime Minister Rabin.
[Peres] They painted him in the uniform of Hitler.
I got my portion too.
I was also attacked and threatened.
[narrator] A peace rally at Kings of Israel Square,  the largest in Tel Aviv,
is held to mobilize support for the government.
Rabin is not optimistic about what it will achieve.
[Peres] When the rally opened, it was the greatest surprise.
They say it was the largest gathering...
and young people,
and enthusiastic.
And they shouted: "Rabin! Rabin! Rabin!"
We knew each other a very long time.
He never embraced me.
I never heard him sing.
And there he was embracing, happy, singing.
That was his happiest day in his life.
[narrator] When the rally ends, Rabin and Peres leave for their cars.
The prime minister returning to his Tel Aviv home,
and Peres for business in Jerusalem.
[Peres] And I arrived at the door of my car
and I heard the shots.
And all of a sudden, the security people
pushed me in the car.
I said: "What happened to Yitzhak?"
They wouldn't tell me.
I said, "What do you mean, you don't tell me?"
So, one of them says: "He was taken to the hospital."
I said: "Go to the hospital."
He says: "No.
We have orders not to let you move."
So, I said: "I'm my own boss, so I'm going to walk."
It wasn't far away.
They saw that I am serious,
so they decided to take the car
and they brought me to the hospital.
The head of the hospital
asked to see me aside...
and then he whispered,
he says:
"He's no longer alive."
We found Leah.
I told her, "Unfortunately, Yitzhak is no longer alive."
He was lying on a bed,
half the body covered.
She embraced him and kissed him.
And then I embraced him and kissed him.
[reporter 3 in Hebrew] The government of Israel announces in shock,
with great sorrow and deep grief,
the death of Prime Minister and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
who was murdered by an assassin tonight in Tel Aviv.
[Peres] Everybody was so shocked.
It didn't take a few moments.
The whole place was full with young girls and boys,
crying like babies,
and the whole nation was crying.
[narrator] Shimon is unanimously named by the Cabinet to replace Yitzhak Rabin
as Israel's prime minister.
Many around him insist he call for early elections,
predicting he would win by a landslide
against his likely opponent, the Likud Party's Benjamin Netanyahu,
but Peres refuses.
[Peres] I told myself: "No.
I'm not going to take advantage of such a tragedy."
[Bar-Zohar] Peres took it much more to the heart than people realized.
Peres was very deeply wounded and hurt by the death of Rabin,
and when he spoke about him as "my elder brother," he meant it.
[Peres] I felt like I was cut in half, you know.
Our relations at the last days were really brilliant.
It was such a heavy load.
And, you know, in those moments
you really don't know whom to ask for advice.
Those are the most lonely moments  in your life.
[narrator] A new series of terrorist attacks  starting in February 1996
soon overshadows everything Shimon Peres has been trying to accomplish
to heal the nation.
In less than ten days,
in five separate incidents in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv,
over 60 people are killed and almost 300 wounded
in bombing attacks on buses.
The worst is a suicide bombing  on crowded Dizengoff Street
in central Tel Aviv, killing 14 and wounding 157.
[Peres] I called in Arafat.
I said: "What are you doing?"
He said: "I shall stop it."
He arrested hundreds of the heads of Hamas.
A little bit too late and too slow.
I knew in my heart that I lost the elections.
[narrator] Benjamin Netanyahu defeats Shimon Peres by just one percentage point.
At 47 years of age,
he becomes the youngest prime minister  in Israel's history.
Shimon Peres is now back in the Knesset as leader of the opposition.
Speaking forcefully against the policies of the new prime minister.
[in Hebrew] It is necessary to keep up with the momentum of peacemaking.
[narrator] But in the evening, a curious development is taking place.
[Bar-Zohar] Shimon was the head of the opposition.
He was fighting Bibi everyday in Parliament,
and at night, Bibi would send him a car and take him to his home in Jerusalem.
And they spent night after night together,
Shimon instructing Bibi how to deal with the Palestinians,
how to speak with Arafat.
With all his experience, with the peace talks with the Palestinians.
For Shimon, it was only normal  to help Bibi because that was for the state of Israel,
and for Bibi it was only normal to turn to this older statesman
who knew what he was talking about.
[narrator] A year after his defeat,
Shimon Peres steps down  as the chairman of the Labor Party.
In 1999, Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition collapses
and the Labor Party's new leader, Ehud Barak,
wins the Prime Minister's Office in a landslide.
A few months later, a financial scandal forces
President Ezer Weizman to resign before the end of his term.
Shimon Peres emerges as the leading candidate  to take his place.
Plans are being made for an inauguration celebration.
They're premature.
When the vote takes place in the Knesset,
several lawmakers who pledged their support for Peres
switch their allegiance to his opponent,
a little known political figure outside of Israel named Moshe Katsav.
Shimon loses by six votes.
He's humiliated,
not only before the Knesset, but in front of his family and the nation.
March 2001, Ariel Sharon defeats Ehud Barak almost two to one,
March 2001, Ariel Sharon defeats Ehud Barak almost two to one, becoming Israel's eleventh prime minister.
Despite his hardliner reputation,
two years later, he announces a proposal to evacuate all Jewish settlements
and unilaterally withdraw the IDF from the Gaza Strip,
handing it over completely  to the Palestinian Authority by 2005.
The Likud and its right wing coalition partners go into open revolt.
Shimon Peres expresses his support for the disengagement.
[Peres] We didn't agree on many things,
but we kept our friendly relations.
He trusted me. I liked him.
He said: "Shimon, I want a favor.
Ask Sonya to prepare a dinner that I like."
Usually her dish was chicken in honey.
"But I am not coming just to enjoy the dinner.
I'm going to tell you
that I'm contemplating to make a revolution."
[narrator] The revolution is a new political party called Kadima or "Forward" in English.
He would run in the upcoming elections and he wanted Shimon to join him.
[Peres] The greatest builder of settlements,
all of a sudden
took a different direction.
On one hand, he was a great warrior.
On the other hand, he understood that we need peace.
[narrator] But Ariel Sharon would never see
[narrator] But Ariel Sharon would never see  Kadima come to fruition in the March 2006 elections.
He suffers a massive stroke in early January,
entering into a coma from which he will never recover.
Kadima wins handily with Ehud Olmert at its head,
and Shimon agrees to serve as deputy prime minister
in the new coalition.
At almost 83 years of age,
he's back at the highest ranks of government.
Although he's praised for joining Kadima,
others, including some old friends, criticize him for abandoning Labor.
June 2007.
President Katsav resigns after being accused  of rape and sexual harassment.
Almost immediately, Shimon Peres is being discussed as the most logical and best replacement.
While he's willing to run,
there are strong reservations within the Peres family.
[woman 1] We were having a family Shabbat dinner at my parents' house,
and he said: "Let's have a vote."
And I must confess that I voted against.
And my vote was a vote of love
because I still had a very strong memory of what happened the first time around.
[narrator] Sonya is the most strongly opposed.
She wants him to turn down the position and retire.
[Peres] Sonya told me: "My dear, enough is enough.
You are working day and night, years after years.
The time has come. You'll take a rest."
[narrator] Despite Sonya's feelings,
Peres consents to be put up once again as a candidate for the presidency.
In June 2007, he wins overwhelmingly,
becoming Israel's ninth president.
It is just two months before his 84th birthday.
[Bar-Zohar] And I went to Shimon, said: "Shimon, Sonya says
she's not coming with you to Jerusalem."
He said, "She will."
I told her: "Sonya, I don't do it for pleasure.
As long as the country calls me,
as long as I can serve, you must understand."
She didn't want to come with me to the Presidency.
She herself remained in Tel Aviv,
and I came to Jerusalem.
[Bar-Zohar] She asked him to take his affairs out of the house,  his books, and he wanted to very much to get her back.
his books, and he wanted to very much to get her back.
He sent her all kind of messages in interviews he gave to the papers.
That was very, very sad.
They were two people who really loved each other very deeply,
even when they were separated.
[narrator] The Presidency, since Israel's founding, has largely been a ceremonial position.
Shimon Peres decides to revitalize and redefine the office.
[Bar-Zohar] He went all over the world and he was the symbol of Israel
and the symbol of maturity, of moderation, of vision,
of fighting for peace.
He became the president of everybody.
The most dramatic thing was when he went to Germany,
when he went to Berlin and he spoke at the Reichstag.
Hitler's place.
And Shimon walks in and puts his skullcap,
and speaks about his grandfather who was burned alive by the Nazis  and then he says Kaddish.
who was burned alive by the Nazis  and then he says Kaddish.
[Bar-Zohar] That was a very dramatic and very symbolic moment.
[Peres in Hebrew] I am proud of the revival of Israel,
the moral and historic answer
to the attempt to erase the Jewish people from the face of the earth.
Jewish history continues to move forward on two parallel tracks:
The moral track, encapsulated in the Ten Commandments.
The document which was written some three thousand years ago.
And the scientific track, which unravels hidden secrets
concealed in the past from the eyes of men,
and which, unraveled, change our lives.
I started with the memorial prayer
and will end with Israel's national anthem.
Our hope is not lost. The hope of 2,000 years...
to be free people in our land, land of Zion and Jerusalem.
Thank you all.
[Bar-Zohar] Only Shimon could do it. Nobody else.
[narrator] President Shimon Peres also becomes
one of the most trusted statesmen on the international arena.
Leaders from all around the world make it their business to seek him out for advice and counsel.
[man 4] My view of leadership is you got to lead for a better tomorrow,
but leaders should also look beyond the horizon
and think strategically on behalf of people.
Shimon Peres certainly did.
And I spent a lot of time talking to him about his view
of how to help the region grow peacefully,
and I believe ultimately that'll happen.
[man 1] Shimon was a model for me in many ways,
but most particularly, because of  the spirit that he brought to politics,
which was always and enduringly the spirit of the optimist.
When I left office and became involved in the politics of the Middle East and the peace process,
Shimon was someone I consulted a lot,
and someone who also gave me hope that
something can be achieved because he himself never lost hope,
never gave up believing that in the end
there would be a peace between Israel and its neighbors.
[man 5] I was still a senator.
At that point, I wasn't a sure thing, to be president.
When I was visiting Israel  after I had won the nomination,
Shimon asked if we could have a little bit of time together.
The genuine interest he had taken in my campaign,
the degree to which he expressed hope
that the kind of optimistic politics that I was trying to represent
was something that could be duplicated and captured in the Middle East.
It was, I think, a great...
and flattering moment for me.
[Barack Obama] One of our strongest allies and one of our closest friends
is the State of Israel.
And no individual has done so much over so many years
to build our alliance and to bring our two nations closer
as our friend, Shimon Peres.
[narrator] On January 20, 2011,
Shimon Peres received word that Sonya died peacefully in her sleep
in the Tel Aviv apartment they once shared.
Deeply in grief, he rushes to Tel Aviv to be with his children and grandchildren.
Sonya's funeral is held the following day.
Her wish is to be buried at Ben Shemen,
a place she always loved and where she met Shimon in 1940.
When her gravestone is unveiled 30 days later,
a second monument is also uncovered.
On it is a message from her husband,
"I loved you from the first moment I saw you.
I will love you until the last. Shimon."
[Peres] Sonya was an unusual person.
No ceremony.
She never appeared in the press.
She never appeared publicly.
Many organizations asked her to chair them.
She agreed to sweep the floors.
After her death, I discovered she took half of our salaries
and sent it,
without writing who is the sender,
to people who asked for help.
Our home was very modest.
But she also educated the children to be honest,
to serve the people,
not to try and make an impression.
And to this very day, I have tears in my eyes...
thank her for what she did for the children.
[man 9] Happy birthday!
As Shimon Peres enters the final year of his presidency,
a gala celebration is held at Jerusalem's International Convention Center
on the occasion of his 90th birthday.
Among the 3,000 invited guests are family and friends,
movie stars and entertainers, dignitaries and world leaders.
The highlight of the evening
is a special performance by Barbra Streisand.
The Oscar and Grammy award-winning actress, director, and singer,
is a favorite of the president,
who is known to play her albums to relax after a long day serving as the then oldest leader in the world.
after a long day serving as the then oldest leader in the world.
Ms. Streisand performs her signature song, "People,"
as well as the classic high holiday prayer, "Avinu Malkeinu."
[Barbara Streisand] It was a request from President Peres.
He loved those two songs.
I've always loved Avinu Malkeinu.
It's a crying out,
and I said at that event: "Avinu Malkeinu asks God
to help bring an end to war and famine
and cause all hate and oppression to vanish from the Earth."
So the song appeals to our best selves
and reminds us to strive for the kind of world
that Shimon fought so hard, so hard to create.
[narrator] As President Peres approaches the final days of his term in office,
many Israelis openly lament that he cannot stay in office indefinitely.
But in July 2014, Shimon Peres ends his term as required by law.
[Almog] The question that was really very much  on people's minds back then
was what will he do next?
That's how we came up with this concept of a video.
[in Hebrew] Mr. President, are you done packing?
I'm working on it.
Have you decided what to do next?
Working on that too.
WANTED ADS
So what kind of experience do you have?
I was an excellent cow milker.
It's all automated these days.
I was also a shepherd, never lost a sheep!
So you have no experience.
Well, let's try and hope for the best.
Full tank please.
-Water and oil? -No, thanks.
Would you like a six-pack of bottled water?
Not interested.
-Dora floaties? -No! Can I please pay?
Go in peace!
It's the only solution!
They said 45 minutes. It's been almost an hour.
It's not a long journey,
but getting to this point was so hard. I'm sorry.
Thanks.
How about a tip?
Coach, I can't do it!
The future belongs to those who dare!
Let's go. We have lots of work to do.
There's nothing here.
When there's nothing, you can do anything!
[narrator] Shimon Peres marches into the next phase of his life
and redefines his so-called retirement,
much as he had other jobs he'd taken for more than 70 years.
He's a keynote speaker at international forums, like Davos and Geneva.
And the TED Talks.
He is also, with the help of his son Chemi,
expanding the mission of the Peres Center for Peace,
founded in the late 1990s,
located in a mixed Jewish and Arab neighborhood in Jaffa,
adjacent to Tel Aviv.
They're transforming it into The Peres Center for Peace and Innovation,
promoting Israel's high technology sector,
which Peres helped to give birth to when he developed Dimona.
[Chemi Peres] He was one of the founders of the start-up nation
and basically turned Israel into a state of science and technology,
and he always looked about the next technologies that Israel need to embrace
in order to continue its journey to the future.
The Innovation Center, by bringing together Arabs and Jews,
especially Israeli Arabs, but also Palestinians,
these links between Israelis and Palestinians,
that can be a kind of corridor to peace,
and it's very symbolic that he started that.
That became his testament, actually.
[narrator] For more than 92 years,
Shimon Peres has never given much thought to his health,
which has always been robust.
He continues to maintain a schedule that would exhaust people half his age.
But in January 2016,
he suffers what is later described as a minor heart attack.
Peres recovers quickly and is back in action making speeches,
traveling and starting work  on a new, very personal memoir.
In August 2016, he celebrates his 93rd birthday.
A month later, on September 13,
Peres addresses a group of high tech entrepreneurs,
speaking for more than an hour about Israel and his world view.
[Chemi Peres] And after lunch, he did not feel well.
And then the team decided to send him to the hospital
to do routine checks,
and in the afternoon, while he was there,
he experienced a stroke.
[narrator] While the stroke is a major one,
there is some hope that President Peres might recover.
But as the days pass, his condition deteriorates.
He passed away on the 28th of September,
just before the holiday, Rosh Hashanah.
[Almog] On the day of the funeral,
I published a piece in the paper that I write for Yedioth Ahronoth.
And then I wrote about the incredible outpouring of concern and love that we experienced.
Everyone, to a certain degree, lost a father and a grandfather.
He was controversial in some ways,
and not everybody liked him throughout his life,
but there was no doubt, especially in his later years,
that his heart was in the right place
and that what he did, he did for us,
for our future, and for our children.
And I think he personified a sense of hope
about what Israel can and should aspire to be.
[Chemi Peres] My father never gave up.
Even in the worst situations,
he managed to rise up again and face tomorrow.
Always with optimism,
always with a belief that there's no limit to what we can do, and what we can achieve, if we only dream and if we only imagine.
and what we can achieve, if we only dream and if we only imagine.
The solace that we found is with the fact that he left a tremendous legacy
and the notion that he lived a full life,
a meaningful life,
and he left the world gracefully.
And he managed to complete everything that he had in mind,
besides one thing,
which is realizing the dream of peace to its entirety.
But I believe that he knew that that day will come,
even though he will not live to see it.
[Obama] By the time that I came to work with Shimon,
he was in the twilight of his years,
although he might not admit it.
I took great pleasure in my friendship  with this older, wiser man.
Shimon Peres reminds us that the State of Israel,
like the United States of America, was not built by cynics,
and Shimon Peres was never cynical.
It is that faith, that optimism, that belief,
even when all the evidence is to the contrary,
that tomorrow can be better.
That makes us not just honor Shimon Peres, but love him.
His critics often claimed
he was a naive, overly optimistic dreamer.
They were only wrong about the naive part.
He knew exactly what he was doing in being overly optimistic.
He knew exactly what he was doing with his dreams.
If those of us who loved him from near and far
accept our duty to keep his gifts alive,
in his honor, I ask that we remember
Shimon Peres' luminous smile.
And imagine.
[narrator] In 1998, Shimon Peres wrote a short book entitled
The Imaginary Voyage,
in which he envisioned Theodor Herzl, the founder of political Zionism,
returning to a land he had only visited once, now the modern state of Israel.
In this imagining, Shimon takes Herzl from one end of the country to the other,
proudly showing the founding father what his dreams had given birth to.
At the end of the journey, as Peres brings Herzl to the Galilee,
not far from the kibbutz he found at Alumot, he writes:
"And so, Herzl and I end our imaginary voyage.
Joining us are the millions of all the generations who,
over the course of the centuries, made up the Jewish people.
Those who lived here before the Roman rule and those who lived after.
The poets from Spain, China, and Vishneva.
The disciples of the Baal Shem Tov and the Vilna Gaon.
The survivors of the massacres during the Middle Ages and of the Shoah.
They were all gathered to listen to Herzl recite the words
that came spontaneously to his lips  at the first Zionist congress in Basel.
'If you will it, it is no dream.'"
[Peres] I think my real talent was to dream.
I never accepted things as they are.
You have to dream. You have to imagine.
You have really to take risks, and don't be afraid.
I'm telling the young people,
that each of you, every girl and every boy,
are richer, and deeper, and better than you think.
Look in yourself.
Keep your curiosity.
Keep your trust.
And don't be disappointed if you won't achieve it in a fortnight.
No, it's a long march.
But it doesn't mean when you are a dreamer,
you have to dream the same thing all the time.
Now Zionism was a dream.
We were 2,000 years without land, in exile,
and Herzl dreamed that the day will come,
and we shall have a new old land, as he called it.
We achieved. Now we have new dreams.
Maybe finally we shall come to a land
that has more perfection than the land today.
The search of perfection is our great voyage.
What I am doing is not dreaming.
Because I'll only say this once.
For a year and 11 months,
a family has been grieving the loss of this individual.
And on Saturday, you called it a soap opera.
On Sunday, you compared it to an Almodóvar movie.
This is no soap opera.
It's a trial for a 19-year-old girl.
A search is underway in Mijas, Málaga, for a 19-year-old woman.
Rocío Wanninkhof.
Everyone was covering it. The press, television, and the radio.
It was one of the most high-profile cases in recent years and of its time.
Criminology seeks to answer the question,
"Why do certain people cross that line and end up killing someone?"
I'm a lawyer and criminologist. I'd say this case is an example
for any law student.
Well, there were a lot of us at first, and Rocío was there from the start.
It's not like she was that into soccer,
but she did enjoy the fun times we had, and--
She tried it and liked it.
She was number six, the number she liked.
-Yeah, six. -We each had our own number.
Our own assigned number. We'd argue if anyone changed it.
-Our family and friends sat here. -Yeah.
Everyone came. Her mother, Rocío, Rosa, Alicia--
-Everyone came. -All the moms sat here.
When we scored our first goal, Rocío and I would do this.
This little cheer. "No, copyright."
Yeah, and then we'd copy her right away, and she'd go, "No, copyright."
-Yeah. -We were just kid--
-We were only 15 or 16 years old. -Sixteen.
We were kids.
She was so in love with her boyfriend at the time, Toni.
-So in love. -Yeah, she was crazy about him. Crazy.
-They were the best-looking couple. -He was gorgeous, and so was she.
A beautiful couple. Two attractive people.
-She was a lot of fun to be around. -A lot of fun.
-She was always smiling-- -Always.
-I never saw her get mad at anyone. -Never.
She never got mad.
-She was a fun-loving girl. -Yeah.
Always. She was always in the mood for fun.
Yeah.
I remember back then, maybe two or three years in a row,
they had a heavy metal tent at the fair.
From the entrance,
there was the area with rides for kids,
and then the area with tents, where people would go to eat and dance.
The back, right next to the river, was for young people.
They set up four shacks,
where we'd drink kalimotxo, which is what we did then.
Lots of kalimotxo, heavy metal, and rock. But it was great. All good vibes, always.
That night, we'd planned to meet there.
And I remember it was around ten o'clock at night.
A few of us from our friend group were there, waiting.
Hours went by, and Rocío still hadn't arrived.
We were waiting for her there, and she didn't show up.
She left her boyfriend's house.
It was a long walk up that hill.
It wasn't lit, and it was surrounded by fields.
So yeah, she never made it there.
My daughter didn't come home that night, so we went looking for her.
We were walking along, and I saw a pretty large bloodstain.
And I said, "Look at that big bloodstain over there."
"Looks like an animal was killed."
I got a bit closer,
and I saw my daughter's sneakers.
"Those are Rocío's sneakers."
And he said, "They can't be."
I said, "Those are my daughter's sneakers."
Well, I got hysterical, out of my mind.
I told him, "Call the police. Those are her sneakers."
LONG HAIR, BROWN EYES
MISSING PERSON REPORT
When she was reported missing,
the examining magistrate called, telling us about a possible crime scene
and asking for our forensic input.
Our first assessment was an incident had taken place there,
involving a lot of blood.
We thought that some kind of assault
involving nose or mouth injuries had occurred.
Perhaps even a stabbing.
As we moved forward, we kept finding larger, more drawn-out trails of blood.
They indicated the person had been moving much more quickly.
Running, maybe.
The trails tapered off for a bit,
until we came to an area with a much larger bloodstain,
indicating there had been significant blood loss.
More bloodstains were found
that were consistent with what we thought was a body being dragged.
They stopped in an area where, as I recall, there were tire tracks.
We attempted to identify both the tires and the type of vehicle.
We came across a bloodstained tissue,
and we found a pair of sneakers, which were identified as the victim's.
PHOTOGRAPHIC REPORT
-SAMPLES FOR ANALYSIS -BLOOD SAMPLES
-SNEAKERS -ON THE TISSUE
CIGARETTE BUTT
The cigarette butts were sent out
to see if DNA could be obtained from the saliva on them.
We collected everything we thought might provide information
about whether someone had been there who we could, at some point, identify
about whether someone had been there who we could, at some point, identify using those samples.
DNA OF A MALE FOUND ON THE CIGARETTE BUTT
We then began a more in-depth investigation
based on that data.
I don't remember who called me or how I found out Rocío had been missing
since the night we'd planned to meet.
I remember turning on the news in the morning and hearing on the radio
that Rocío had disappeared.
And it was a shock. I started crying. My boss asked, "What's wrong?"
I said, "That's my friend." "What happened?"
That's when I learned that, in La Cala, the local police
and medical personnel were already conducting a search.
So, I asked my boss if I could join the search party,
So, I asked my boss if I could join the search party, along with the rest of my friends.
I'm asking everyone to please bring my daughter back.
And to treat her as well as possible. Many people--
Thank you to the people who are helping us.
There are so many of them.
I have three daughters around her age.
We live nearby. We came to offer our support.
To support her mother, her father, and her whole family.
We're going to try to keep this going, and we won't stop until Rocío's found.
The search continues.
The 19-year-old who went missing on Saturday…
A week after the search, involving over 600 people, began…
Groups went with the Civil Defence and local police,
and we went out on our own, on our dirt bikes, up into the hills.
Just searching. Like looking for a needle in a haystack.
And we were on edge, thinking,
"What if something really happened and I find her?"
"Or I lift up a manhole cover and find her?"
"What if I happen to look behind that tree? What if…"
It was really tough.
I remember we went with a coworker.
We parked our van outside Alicia Hornos's house.
People were constantly coming and going.
The family kept coming out to talk to the media, who were asking for them.
If no one speaks up, if no one says anything,
then people forget.
And as you can see, the media's all here,
the press is here, all the TV stations are here.
It's the only way to keep this alive.
I want them to give her back.
Dead or alive, I just want her back.
Three weeks had gone by,
and, of course, there were lots of tears and anxiety over her disappearance,
a lot of crying.
And that feeling spread.
It wasn't just the family, who was the most affected, who felt it.
The volunteers, her friends from school, and her neighborhood friends felt it too.
That was basically the whole mood.
A mood of pervasive sadness.
We're about to bring you news that we hoped never to have to share.
A body has been found that may be that of Rocío Wanninkhof,
25 days after she went missing.
The body was found hidden in some hedges separating a housing development,
just 200 meters away from the highway to Marbella,
along a path where hardly any vehicle could fit.
When authorities arrived on the scene to remove the body,
they found little was left but a skeleton.
It looked like a body that had been there for much longer.
While collecting samples,
they found some bags, big black garbage bags,
with clothes in them,
mostly T-shirts.
Based on those T-shirts, we began to feel reasonably confident
that the body might be that of the girl, Rocío Wanninkhof.
You know what? I pass by there every day.
And I remember, every day. I turn my head and look, out of habit.
On the way there and back.
And I think, "We were looking here, and she was found 20 kilometers away."
When we planned the autopsy, the five medical examiners present--
I mean, six of us--
we actually did it almost in secret
because we knew it was a media circus.
So we conducted the autopsy and took our time with it.
We worked into the night, trying to use all our know-how
because we knew it would be all over the media.
The body we had to work with was going to provide us with
much less information than it would have had it decomposed at a normal rate.
But under certain conditions of humidity, rain, and heat,
decomposition occurs much more quickly.
There were no organs left. In other words, all we found were bones.
So we had to find something else
that might tell us how the alleged attack could have occurred.
Multiple, closely-spaced wounds were present,
primarily on the back of the corpse.
I believe there were eight very repetitive stab wounds,
delivered by some kind of single-edged bladed weapon.
Conclusions?
Well, this attack was really very vicious and repetitive.
The assailant apparently carried it out very quickly
because the victim was either totally restrained
or didn't have enough time to move.
I have no doubt that, right now, you must be feeling heartbroken.
My heart and thoughts go out to them,
but especially to you, her parents and siblings.
-Stop that, please. -Come on.
-Viva Rocío! -Viva!
Out of the way. Show some respect, please. Out of the way. Come on.
-Come on, now. -Viva!
Make room.
-Just a little. -Let them through.
-We'll lower her and put her in. -Okay.
-Come on. -Let's move forward.
-Let's move forward a bit. Come on. -Goodbye, beautiful. Goodbye.
Come on. A little more. A little further. Push. Come on.
-Give them a moment alone. -Come on. It's her mother. Just a moment.
At that point, obviously,
everyone close to Rocío, and even everyone in her town, was living in fear.
This fear was fueled, in part, by the panic stirred up by the press,
especially the television programs talking about the case.
Ultimately, that led to the involvement of the elite Civil Guard squad
that had played an active role in the Alcàsser investigation.
So they were greeted with open arms.
The investigators found some fingerprints
on the plastic bags at the last crime scene.
They analyzed the tire tracks found in the vacant lot.
And they found two textile fibers on Rocío Wanninkhof's body.
At that point, the investigations were still not leading up to anyone's arrest.
But there were already certain pieces of information, evidence, and speculations
But there were already certain pieces of information, evidence, and speculations that the Civil Guard were exploring.
As this remains an open case, we're all asking,
"Who is the culprit? When will they be caught?"
The investigators needed to find something.
They were under enormous pressure from the public.
And they had nothing.
The fact that Rocío's body was found in such poor condition
made it impossible to confirm basic details.
Like, for example, whether Rocío had been sexually assaulted.
VISUAL INSPECTION REPORT
THE NAKED CORPSE
What happened?
Well, one of the theories and conclusions the investigators came to
upon seeing that the body's legs were spread--
since they were spread so wide apart, they believed it had been staged.
In other words, the perpetrator had tampered with the crime scene
to make it look like a sexual assault.
So they ruled out sexual assault
and focused on the motive of hatred and revenge.
-Could this be a crime of passion? -Someone very close to the family.
Very passionate and very resentful.
-Very close to them. -Margarita Landi's opinion.
Which I partly agree with.
So they began questioning the people closest to Rocío Wanninkhof.
WE ARE HEREBY TAKING A STATEMENT FROM
Even her boyfriend was questioned,
as was Rocío's family.
And everyone had an alibi.
Can we ask you just one question?
It's been almost a year since Rocío's death.
For now, the Civil Guard has narrowed down the number of prime suspects to three.
Two men and a woman.
Near the end of the year, they identified a suspect
that signs supposedly pointed to.
SIGNS
In the end, what aroused suspicion was someone reported having seen a woman
In the end, what aroused suspicion was someone reported having seen a woman stabbing Rocío's photo.
It seems police are getting closer to finding Rocío Wanninkhof's killer.
Not only did news come out about there being a suspect,
but the suspect's full name was released.
Dolores Vázquez.
There she is, Loli Vázquez.
TELEDIARIO
In the early hours of October 9 last year, Rocío Wanninkhof was killed,
stabbed ten times in the back.
Her body was found after a long search.
Today, a friend of the woman's mother spent five hours before the judge,
accused of that murder.
Come on. Everyone out of the way!
The police called to say
that they had arrested María Dolores Vázquez. Loli.
I was stunned. She's the last person I'd have suspected.
She was good to me during the separation. She helped with the kids.
Getting them from school, giving them rides, baths, making dinner.
She helped out a lot.
Where are you taking her?
Murderer!
Murderer!
Murderer!
Murderer!
María Dolores Vázquez, a close friend of the girl's mother.
Dolores is Alicia's close friend.
Their close friend.
Dolores Vázquez, a family friend.
Accused of killing the daughter of Alicia Hornos, her former close friend.
She was Rocío's mother's best friend.
She watched her grow up. She helped raise her like a second mother.
They bought this house in Mijas and started a new life together,
They bought this house in Mijas and started a new life together, with Alicia's three children.
The victim's mother, Alicia, had three children.
She'd separated from her husband, who lived in the Netherlands,
and gotten involved with someone.
She began a relationship with Dolores Vázquez.
They were romantically involved for almost 11 years.
She'd helped raise Alicia's daughters.
But, at the time of the crime,
their relationship had already been over for four years.
I loved her more than I've ever loved anyone.
Truly.
She gave me affection and support.
She comforted me.
And I loved her so much.
My daughter lived with them for many years when she was studying in Málaga.
And she was with her aunt Loli, Alicia, and Rocío then.
They're all lovely girls.
Alicia, too. So, to us, it was all perfectly normal.
JUDGE SENDS WANNINKHOF'S ALLEGED KILLER TO JAIL
The investigation began to center on Vázquez.
And there was the motive, one of the motives that any jury or court could begin to consider,
or court could begin to consider,
which is that the girl was an obstacle, or was against,
which is that the girl was an obstacle, or was against, or was somehow, a problem
for Dolores's relationship with the girl's mother.
So we had the motive.
Loli said if it weren't for Rocío, I'd have gotten back with her.
That's why my daughter was killed.
If she hadn't been so jealous
and felt I was with someone else, maybe my daughter would still be alive.
So she did it out of revenge because I didn't want to go back to her.
Dolores Vázquez, in the eyes of the media and the public, was guilty
Dolores Vázquez, in the eyes of the media and the public, was guilty from the moment she was arrested.
What do you think? What does your heart tell you?
I have to say that she seems guilty to me.
ARRESTED
Though she hasn't confessed, La Cala residents are convinced.
There were rumors. Things were already being said about her.
From the beginning, the family and police believed the attacker knew Rocío.
Misleading clues, allegedly planted by Dolores,
hindered the investigation.
This crime, this event,
provided material for TV shows.
One of the first in the sense that, altogether, the elements
really represented a lot of underlying social issues.
Primarily homophobia toward lesbians.
The family says Dolores is a hard woman who is aggressive and very possessive.
She's highly vindictive, and she's very tough.
How can Alicia Hornos say such outrageous things
and spread so many slanderous lies about my sister,
knowing that my sister helped her raise those three kids?
Spiteful, aggressive, calculating.
Very cold and calculating. Totally.
A character was taking shape.
An evil woman, a cold woman.
A woman who had laid in wait four years
and devised a plan to kill Rocío Wanninkhof because she hated her.
ALICIA HORNOS CLAIMS DOLORES KILLED HER DAUGHTER AS REVENGE
I can still remember the lines at the door
because the whole thing had become something like a soap opera.
People wanted to follow the trial, and they didn't miss a minute of it.
They'd wait for four, five hours
to get into the courtroom and see what would happen.
I think that's the most unsettling memory I have.
I'll be following the trial. I'm retired. I've got nothing better to do.
Well, I'm siding with the dead girl's mother.
She lost her daughter.
She must be suffering. I know. I'm a mother too.
And that's huge.
And that other woman,
she seems very cold, very controlling to me.
The odds were stacked against Dolores
because she was Dolores, someone who wasn't likable.
She wasn't nice or friendly.
She was a lesbian in 1999
and could be sentenced to 15 years in prison.
During this trial, we really had to fight a battle on the streets,
During this trial, we really had to fight a battle on the streets, as well as in the courtroom.
And that information combined
with all that media hype really has an impact when it's a trial by jury.
Members of the press, please wrap it up.
Witness questioning is ongoing. It will take a long time.
Over 50 people have been summoned to testify.
This morning, a video from Informe Semanal was shown in court.
It shows a member of the Civil Guard
stating there was no direct evidence against Dolores Vázquez.
We'll let the investigation carry on, taking whatever steps necessary
to find conclusive evidence that will clarify what happened.
Because, for now, the truth is that we don't know anything for sure,
not even how or--
We have our theories, but we don't know what actually happened.
Given the lack of physical evidence, the Civil Guard issued a report
that contained signs
pointing to Dolores Vázquez, as well as a psychological profile.
The main piece of evidence
was the hatred Dolores Vázquez felt toward Rocío.
You have testified
that you often clashed because you were so alike.
You were both very stubborn, and you both liked to have it your way.
Yes, sir, but that doesn't mean we clashed
in the sense that Rocío and I didn't love each other,
or that we argued.
I had a good relationship with Rocío, more so than her mother
and the family think.
A domestic worker, a Russian woman, if memory serves,
gave an account of a very significant event,
much like something out of a movie, which is that--
As everyone will remember, photos of her were posted all over town.
She took a kitchen knife and started stabbing one of those photos.
While she did that with the knife, she said, "This is my problem!"
She explained, "I was at home, crying at the sight of Rocío's picture."
"Because my housekeeper barely understands any Spanish,
I picked up a knife to show that Rocío had been murdered."
ORAL HEARING PROCEEDINGS
What did Dolores have going for her?
She wasn't seen at the crime scene,
the tire tracks didn't match any of the cars she owned,
and the textile fibers found didn't match Dolores's clothing.
It was shown that the fingerprints found on the garbage bags
did not match those of Dolores Vázquez.
And she had an alibi.
She said she'd been watching a great-niece of hers that day,
but it wasn't taken into account.
One comment that kept coming up, because you'd hear people saying it, was,
"She's not speaking up. It had to be her because…"
She didn't show any remorse.
She didn't give off a sense of injustice.
And that always really influences a jury.
The fact that Dolores Vázquez was a lesbian
was used during the trial almost as a way to attack her.
REPRESSED HOMOSEXUALS EXHIBIT
MORE EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE
It was a way of showing that Dolores Vázquez fit the profile
and was capable of murdering Rocío Wanninkhof.
AS THE VICTIM IS ON HER RIGHT SIDE
SUGGESTS HOMOSEXUAL ASSAULT
THE HOMOSEXUAL
CAUSES OUTBURSTS OF VIOLENCE
When we had visitors or someone came over,
she'd introduce me as her sister
because she was ashamed of our relationship.
Would you say she never accepted her sexual orientation?
I think she had issues with it.
I did not kill Rocío. I did not see Rocío.
All I ask of you, of Spain, of all of Spain,
because a lot has been said about me,
is that you look for whoever did this, because it wasn't me.
Whoever did this is out there.
Maybe even in this courtroom.
There was never any evidence against me.
There never will be, because I'm innocent.
Do you see any proof?
You're in there, too. Do you see any conclusive evidence?
Anything that could send my sister to prison?
I mean, you're journalists, aren't you?
I want her to get at least 20 years.
Because in 20 years, will I get my daughter back?
That won't happen in 14 years or even in 30. Not ever.
The top story this afternoon is the verdict that will be handed down
The top story this afternoon is the verdict that will be handed down at the Provincial Court of Málaga.
You can see how many members of the press and cameramen are outside the courtroom.
We the jury, by majority verdict, find the accused,
We the jury, by majority verdict, find the accused, Ms. Dolores Vázquez Mosquera…
guilty on the count of murder.
I said to my sister, "Jose, we're going to win."
"Well, this isn't a win, but justice will be done."
And she said, "I'm not so sure."
And I said, "Justice will be done."
And it was. Thank God.
I can see the prosecutor for this very complex case is here.
Maybe we can talk.
How do you feel about the sentence? Your first impression.
I recommended 15 years, so 15 years and one day isn't bad.
Murderer!
I remember everything about that day.
Exactly as it happened.
I got up in the morning, and I went to her room, and she wasn't there.
I called her friends, and her friends didn't--
They told me they'd walked her to the door.
I said, "Well, she isn't here."
So I looked out,
and three doors down from my house,
well, next to the tree was
her shoe,
her purse,
her phone, on the ground.
My husband's car had blood on it, and our neighbor's car did too.
It was August 14, the last day of the fair,
and at around four, I got a call from a reporter with Cadena SER,
asking what I knew about a girl who had gone missing from the Coín fair.
I told him that I didn't have any information about that
and that no girl had been reported missing in Coín.
He assured me one had.
I started seeing vehicles and media broadcast trucks.
That put me on my guard, and I naturally started feeling uneasy.
I asked to speak to the police chief.
That's when he told me Sonia had disappeared early that morning,
that her parents had reported her missing, and that they were investigating
and making initial inquiries.
-Here, or down there? -A little closer.
-A little closer, please. -Sure.
Here, stand together. Too close?
-It's fine. -Just moving the mic closer.
-We'll stay put. -All set.
-Okay. -We still don't know anything yet.
All I'm saying is, if someone knows anything at all--
a friend, because one of her friends must have seen or heard something or--
Please say something and let her go.
Let her go because we've had enough of all this.
Because this is a lot. This is too much.
-Thank you. -Thank you very much.
-Thanks, you guys. -Thank you.
-Is this okay? -Yeah. Great.
Now point it over there. Down there, towards Lucerne.
Slowly.
-The lake. -The lake, right?
The boats.
Well, we got married in Coín.
And my husband had a job in Switzerland,
so I went with him.
And my three kids were born there.
The two older ones first, and then my Sonia.
That's enough!
Enough!
That's enough!
Come on, say something.
Hello.
We had jobs there, and…
-Is it recording? -Yeah.
…we lived there for 26 years.
It's a quarter to eight.
Let's go. Let's get going, everybody.
And when the older two had finished school,
Sonia wanted to move to Spain.
And, well, we did too.
And so we came back here in 2000, 2001.
And she adjusted well.
Of course, she had friends here from when we used to come on vacation.
She had her cousins. She had--
she planned to continue high school
and get her diploma or…
But that wasn't to be.
As the hours go by, despair is setting in for the family
of the 17-year-old girl who went missing in Coín, Málaga, yesterday.
A thorough search of the area is still on,
but her belongings do not bode well, since some were found stained with blood.
I remember there was a light cover in the Sonia Carabantes case.
I know for a fact that Civil Guard officers were sent
to make inquiries at every mechanic in Málaga
to see if a car matching the description had been taken to get a light cover fixed.
We launched several lines of investigation,
such as one into a series of sexual assaults committed
near Torremolinos and Benalmádena.
We also linked it to the disappearance of a girl in Motril
because the girls had a fairly similar profile.
So, considering that they went missing while a fair was going on,
we started looking into
all the fair workers who had been in Motril or Coín.
Go up. Report if you see anything.
If you do, treat it as important, even if you think it isn't.
Everything is important. Clothing, a shoe, anything at all.
Call me, and I'll run down.
People stepped up.
I mean, they, the public as a whole,
were clear about saying,
"This is a local girl, and this is a family who needs our help."
And they began to get involved and donate not just their time,
but everything that might be needed for the search.
When you watched from the upstairs window, or as the day went by, it was moving.
And I still find it moving.
The fact was that a girl had gone missing
and we had to find her.
I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart
for everything you're doing, from the youngest to the oldest.
You're making an incredible effort.
And I don't know how to thank you because that's all I can think to say.
Apart from that, the Civil Guard continued their inquiries and investigations.
But the most important thing was finding her alive.
Did they find her?
People from Madrid said she was found, but it hasn't been confirmed yet.
But she's been found. Yeah.
-But where? -They don't know.
We need to run over there. They called from Madrid.
Today at noon, the body of a young woman was found near Coín.
Turn it up!
Reports have not been confirmed, but they fear it may be Sonia Carabantes,
the 17-year-old who went missing on Thursday.
A woman's body has been found.
We fear the worst, but we're still awaiting confirmation.
The judge just arrived. The judicial police are investigating.
I've been in contact with the government subdelegate.
He told me that, as soon as he heard the news,
he sent a forensic unit here
and he'll be there for whatever the family or I need.
There they go.
It was near Monda, the town next to ours.
And they found her in a stream with--
Rocks had been put on top of her, and--
Well, it had rained a bit the night before,
and a lot had been washed away,
but the dogs had--
they'd already searched there, but--
but that day, well, they found her there under the rocks.
The victim had been at the Coín fair that day.
She said goodbye to her friends just meters from her house,
and she was attacked by the perpetrator.
He struck her, leaving her partially unconscious.
She couldn't have been fully alert because this was a brutal attack.
She tried to defend herself. He put her in the car.
And he took her at least some 11.5 kilometers away
to a secluded location.
There, we know he inflicted both internal and external injuries
and strangled her with a T-shirt, which, ultimately, was the cause of death.
Everyone was shocked.
It was a situation where everyone was on edge.
Girls wouldn't go to the fair, to parties, or even out of their homes.
There was a sense of fear,
an ongoing sense of fear, but not just in Coín,
in the neighboring towns as well.
Not good because I have two nieces and a daughter, and--
Yeah. I'm a bit concerned.
They say it must be someone close to her because she was found not far from Coín.
We don't know who this man is. He's still out there, and the girls--
I have a 15-year-old daughter too.
I'm pretty worried.
The fact that Sonia was found quickly
meant it was possible to obtain, examine, and analyze the forensic evidence.
At a meeting we held at the government subdelegation office,
Colonel Paco Gabella told us
that some trace evidence had been found on Sonia Carabantes's hands.
This biological material was analyzed right away,
and it was entered into the criminal DNA database.
And it was compared.
With what?
Another genetic profile on file, obtained from the cigarette butt
found 2.5 meters from the bloodstain
in the vacant lot from the Rocío Wanninkhof case.
When they compared the two genetic profiles,
they found they were a perfect match.
DNA OF A MALE
The person in that vacant lot in 1999
was the same one who had attacked and killed Sonia Carabantes.
I believe we were the first ones to report that there was a DNA match.
That--
Well, that was a bombshell.
Things are coming to light.
An English cigarette butt, traces of skin under Sonia Carabantes's nails.
The DNA obtained from both belongs to the same person.
There was something to connect the disappearances. Something
so serious, so painful…
and something so awful as well.
All the more so for the person who had spent 17 months in prison.
And from that point forward, things started moving at a dizzying pace.
GUILTY
15 YEARS FOR MURDER
I hope that whoever is guilty pays for this
and serves the full sentence.
During the 14-day trial, the cigarette butt never came up.
A lot of nonsense did, but not that.
The question is whether emerging evidence
will exonerate the accused, Dolores Vázquez.
When faced with that impasse in the investigation,
we got a call from the police station in Fuengirola,
asking if I could please head over there
since there was a Chilean-born British woman
who wanted to speak with us to give us some information.
Cecilia King, a little anxious and nervous about what she was going to tell us,
recalled that,
when her ex-husband had come to pick up or drop off her daughter,
she had seen a scar or injury on the back of his left hand.
Once we had taken Cecilia's statement,
I spoke to a British colleague, John O'Neill, who was at the embassy,
and I asked him about Tony Alexander King.
He told me that they knew Tony by the name of Tony Bromwich
and that he'd committed sexual assaults in London.
This made us all the more certain that we were on the right track.
We found out he worked at a pub
and he lived with a Spanish girl in Alhaurín el Grande.
We set up surveillance at the pub.
We saw him go to work, and, when he finished his shift,
we were surprised to see he went to a school.
There was a house at the school, which is where he lived.
He had a car on the grounds.
It was a Mazda with British plates
and a broken light cover.
-I can't talk. -You can't talk?
So we were sure that he was the one behind those two disappearances and deaths.
When King was arrested,
Dolores had already been released, awaiting retrial
because the High Court of Justice of Andalusia had overturned the verdict.
Why?
Because the jury only had circumstantial evidence.
But what's more, they didn't state what had actually convinced them
to declare Dolores Vázquez guilty.
I wouldn't wish prison on anyone. I've been through some terrible times.
Many months. I'd rather not talk about it.
HOME OF DOLORES VÁZQUEZ
I spent two months, three months in solitary confinement.
What else is there to say?
I'm not saying that I was wrongfully arrested.
Anyone, if I were one of the suspects--
I had nothing to hide, just like I have nothing to hide today.
I went in for questioning, and they began interrogating me
I went in for questioning, and they began interrogating me and saying, "It was you."
It was very intensive brainwashing.
They described the process I'd go through.
They said they'd make me infamous and that no one would believe me.
They'd take me to court. A quick five- or six-month trial,
and I'd be found guilty by a jury.
Well, that's how it happened.
I feel that the verdict,
aside from having a clear lack of sufficient grounds,
was not impartial.
To put it another way, just think of how many TV programs
directly accused Dolores Vázquez without any evidence.
All this information, all that public opinion
that the press and TV put out there
was read, seen, and heard by the members of the jury and the judge every day.
by the members of the jury and the judge every day.
When the real killer was found and it was clear Dolores wasn't involved,
I started to think, and I realized
how I had internalized all the homophobia
that the media and others had been spewing.
How I had believed information that wasn't information, just prejudice, you know?
that wasn't information, just prejudice, you know?
So I began researching what had been said in the media,
and I was a bit shocked.
And I decided to write a book.
TRIAL IN THE STREET
Over time, Dolores Vázquez was being attributed
qualities that were perceived as masculine.
Some were totally ridiculous.
Some of the things they said, if you look at them--
for example, they pointed out she did karate, as if it was a bad thing.
Or that she worked out.
That she had a raspy voice, was commanding, and had authority.
With all this together, they tried to paint a picture of a masculine woman,
with the negative connotations that could have.
They called her barren, jealous of a woman who gave birth and could be a mother.
They said they were unhealthy couples that had
unhealthy relationships that can lead to murder.
All that outrage actually stemmed
from a social climate that couldn't accept that type of relationship.
Is it possible that the relationship between Rocío and Dolores Vázquez
was rocky because, deep down, your daughter didn't accept
you being romantically involved with another woman?
We were shocked.
If you're accusing the wrong person,
if you don't have enough evidence, at least don't accuse someone else, right?
Because if they had made that known,
or investigated further and not focused on just one person,
they'd have found him.
Then, what happened to my daughter would've been avoided.
When they finally arrested
that criminal,
there started to be talk
that Interpol had asked Spain about his whereabouts.
When we heard here in Spain that there had been a report,
naturally, it gave rise to a certain level of fear.
The case was used for political ends
by both the party in power and the opposition party,
through a parliamentary inquiry to Minister of the Interior, Ángel Acebes,
on this case and why they had not intervened.
The King case was discussed in the Chamber of Deputies.
Yes, Ángel Acebes appeared before Parliament on his own initiative
to explain the investigation into the murders of Rocío Wanninkhof and Sonia Carabantes.
The minister explained that British police had sent a memo
requesting confirmation that he was living in Spain
and mentioning crimes of which he was accused.
But since British police had classified it as a low-level matter and hadn't requested extradition,
as a low-level matter and hadn't requested extradition,
it was considered resolved once King's address was confirmed.
Mr. Minister, on September 15, 1998, Scotland Yard
located Anthony Alexander King in Mijas through you.
You were notified as to who he was
and of his conviction and the danger he posed.
The British police also said, "He's a potential threat to women in Spain."
But what doesn't add up is the enormity of the fact
that a dangerous criminal was identified
but it wasn't registered or reported correctly.
A memo from Interpol cannot be handled
how it was by the police under your leadership.
It's true that we received a fax from Interpol, out of London,
informing us that Tony Alexander King-- not to arrest him but to look into him.
We didn't hear back from them.
But that's normal because we get lots of faxes coming in from Interpol
about all sorts of people being on the Costa del Sol.
Not just those involved in sex crimes, but also drug trafficking,
homicide, fraud, all sorts of crimes.
These were blameworthy acts
that have brought suffering, especially to the families
of Rocío Wanninkhof and Sonia Carabantes,
and also another individual, Dolores Vázquez,
who has probably been to hell and back.
If we apply the standard premises for any investigation
to the Rocío Wanninkhof case,
we can conclude that the Civil Guard
we can conclude that the Civil Guard steered the investigation to focus on Dolores Vázquez,
who seemed to fit the most plausible criminal profile.
The authorities have never apologized to me,
nor has Minister Acebes, who thinks he knows everything.
They haven't contacted me at all.
Did I have to lose my daughter so they could finally catch that killer?
I mean, they caught him because my daughter defended herself.
I'm telling you, I didn't send María Dolores Vázquez to prison.
The police told me they were going to lock up Dolores Vázquez.
That she was the suspect.
That she was Rocío's killer.
So, if anyone owes that lady an apology, it's the police.
I don't owe anybody an apology. I didn't lock anyone up.
Be strong!
I'm innocent!
It was a disturbing trial
because it's not something you see every day, fortunately.
It was a very serious matter
since it seemed the victim was chosen at random.
Which means this happened to this person due to pure chance, right?
And that impacts you on every level,
as a judge and as a human being.
I believe the evidence was so solid that he ended up incriminating himself.
Maybe because he felt like the center of attention.
I remember seeing him on TV,
addressing the media while being transferred into a police van.
But it was out of a desire for attention,
rather than a sense of remorse or because he felt he'd done wrong.
I've spent seven years, two months, and 12 days wondering who killed my daughter.
-What do you want from this trial? -Justice.
Justice for my daughter, once and for all.
In one of Tony King's statements to investigators,
he tried to incriminate Dolores Vázquez
and drag her back into these judicial proceedings.
I don't know anything about this man. I don't know anything.
All I know is that I was lynched once,
and I'm scared to death it'll happen again.
I am innocent!
I want the court to recognize my innocence.
I shouldn't have to be here, explaining myself!
I shouldn't have to explain anything!
But public opinion and Spanish society demand,
that, on top of everything else, I prove my innocence.
For my Rocío, poor Sonia, and so many other women.
No. He acted on his own. Always.
He acted on his own. Every time he went out, he went alone.
And he captured those girls, assaulted them, and killed them.
Dolores Vázquez had very bad but also very good luck.
She could still be in jail or have been released just recently.
A retrial was ordered. Who knows what the outcome would've been.
But if the true culprit hadn't been found, we don't know what would've happened.
Today, the Court of Málaga exonerated Dolores Vázquez
of the murder of Rocío Wanninkhof.
This is the end of a four-year ordeal for Dolores Vázquez.
I'll bet anyone, we can settle it in the newspaper archive, that Dolores's arrest
I'll bet anyone, we can settle it in the newspaper archive, that Dolores's arrest takes up many more pages than her acquittal.
The journalists who had written just offensive, horrible things about her
didn't say, "We were wrong. How awful. How could we get so carried away?"
Which is what I, or those in the movement, might say.
"How awful. We were so wrong. How could even we get swept up in it all?"
No one really said that.
It was like, "Let's move on. We found the killer."
"Forget that lady. Let's move on."
And yeah, that's terrible too.
The one who causes harm should be the first to apologize.
And the system obviously caused the harm.
As far as I know, the state hasn't given her compensation.
I think that's a huge mistake.
I talk to this photo a lot.
Since she's always laughing, I say, "You're always laughing at your mom."
I tell her, "You look so gorgeous, honey."
"You're so pretty. How sad you're not here with me."
And she seems to smile and understand.
She was a joy,
and she was always giving me kisses and hugs and saying, "You're so pretty."
That was her.
And now, well, I'm alone, without my little girl.
People say, "You're strong. So is your husband."
It's not that I'm strong. I just have no choice but to keep going.
My fight isn't over.
It's not about financial compensation.
It's more about showing Spanish society
that I am totally innocent and always have been.
So when I walk down the street, people won't give each other nudges.
Or if I go to try on shoes at El Corte Inglés,
just to name a store,
and within 20 minutes, I'm surrounded by women.
"Look who it is."
Good morning.
You'd better lower the heat.
Thanks.
That smells good.
Are you celebrating something?
You idiot. We're having a wake.
-Huh? -A wake.
We hadn't seen Ken around for a while,
so I went to check his tent, but he was already cold.
An-chan, he taught you lots of things when you first got here too, right?
Yeah.
So where's Ken now?
They removed him already.
You should have said, "They took him away."
He's not an object, you know.
Here. You can have this.
-Sake for mourning! -See ya.
An-chan, how about a drink?
Hey! Don't waste your time.
His friend just died,
but he doesn't feel anything?
He's been living over there for a long time.
It seems he can't remember anything.
Is it amnesia?
Who knows?
He seems to be doing fine, but there's something fishy.
Can you smell that?
Thank you.
Could you please sign here?
SUSUMU NAKOSHI
Please open the door.
I'm not a weirdo or anything.
Who are you?
It's cold out here. Could you let me in?
I don't give rides to strangers.
You're homeless, aren't you?
You don't have a home or a job.
Sorry. If I've insulted you, I apologize.
To get down straight to business,
I have a certain job that I'd like you to take.
How does 700,000 yen sound?
Sorry, but I've already got money.
Hey.
Hey. What are you doing?
It's a simple human research experiment.
It's called "trepanation."
Right here, I'll drill a tiny hole in your skull.
Leave.
No, I know the thought of boring a hole in your skull is scary,
but it's really no big deal at all.
-Just leave. -Frankly,
it's just like teeth.
It's just a little hole. Your brain won't be harmed.
That's all.
You've heard it before, right?
Humans only use 10% of their brains.
If we could leverage the other 90%, what would happen?
An intuition sharper than anyone else's could be unleashed,
or a sixth sense could awaken,
or memories could return.
Then put a hole in your own skull.
You can just try it on yourself.
I mean, it's just a tiny hole here, right?
No way.
It sounds scary!
Get lost. Find someone else. Plenty of other people need money.
It has to be you!
This park is where homeless people gather,
and that luxury hotel is where ordinary people go.
I want you, the one who's smack-dab in the middle of both!
Listen, I'm just taking time off work to see what it's like to be homeless.
Well, you could say…
I'm trying to "find myself."
Get someone else.
Whenever you lie, the left side of your mouth goes up.
You can't cry, can you?
You can't even feel sad.
You're desperately trying to feel something.
Right?
I'm right, aren't I?
You must be bored.
No, that's not it.
Most people would get angry if someone said that to them.
Nakoshi.
Do you ever feel alive?
You…
How did you know my name?
You don't remember… do you?
I'll be back.
Hey! This is bad!
Hey!
An-chan with the car!
Hey!
An-chan with the car!
-An-chan! -What happened?
Your car!
Quickly!
DAY ONE
They got you, huh?
SHINJUKU TOWING
They just had to go and take your car, didn't they?
You had your clothes and your stuff in your car, right?
The tow truck is going to cost a lot of money.
But An-chan, you've got lots of money, right?
Hey. You've got money, right?
Hey. Are you okay?
I've never seen him look like that before.
The only place you could return to is gone.
Are you going to stay here forever?
So it was you…
What are you living for?
How should I know?
You finally look annoyed.
Seven days.
I'll give you a reason to live.
What a creepy room.
Trepanation is a surgical procedure that has been done since the Neolithic Period.
Nowadays, a group called ITAG in the Netherlands works to promote it.
There are even people who put a hole in their own head.
What a sicko.
So, who are you?
I'm Manabu Ito. I'm a medical intern.
My father runs this hospital. That makes me the boss's kid.
The boss's kid?
What if your parents found out about this?
I just want to learn about humans.
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah.
How much do you remember about yourself?
Who knows?
You're not interested in yourself?
It doesn't matter anymore.
I'm right in the middle of Shinjuku, but no one's looking for me.
What worth is the life of a man like that?
"A man like that." That's exactly why I'm interested in you.
When humans are born, they have a gap in their skull,
meaning there is a hollow space.
But after a year and a half, that hole closes up,
and the skull starts pushing on the brain.
Therefore, if we open a hole in the skull and improve the blood circulation,
it would activate the brain again, just like how it was at birth.
It would draw out abilities that hadn't been used before.
That's the simple principle behind trepanation.
Don't worry.
Honestly, I'm better than most doctors around here.
Oh, please make sure you don't move while I'm drilling the hole.
It'd be bad if your meninges tear.
If that happens, then whatever.
Even if I become a vegetable,
it wouldn't be any different from how things are now.
Is the anesthetic working?
Yeah.
Ouch…
LET'S HAVE DINNER TOGETHER ITO
DAY TWO
The experiment will last for seven days. I'll pay you 300,000 yen in advance.
You'll get the rest once it's over.
I told you I've got money already.
So? What are you trying to do?
Shouldn't you have asked that before I made the hole?
Here.
ESP experiment,
sixth sense check, psychokinesis experiment…
What is all this? I thought this was a medical experiment.
I'll be honest.
I don't believe in spirits and supernatural powers and the occult.
Everything can be explained by the brain.
That's why I want to use this experiment to clear all the remaining doubts I have
and proudly deny that it exists.
Deny what?
This world right in front of me.
Excuse me. Here's the chili shrimp.
-Thanks for the meal. -Thank you.
Then let's get started with a simple game.
What?
I've got these cards with these five symbols.
Guess which card has the star symbol.
All right.
Nakoshi.
Huh?
Use your left side.
-That's not what I mean. -What?
I want you to try feeling it with your whole left side.
Your senses of sight, hearing, smell, and touch.
Use all of that from only the left side of your body to envision the card.
All right.
Don't get too full of yourself.
Today was just practice. We'll get to the real stuff tomorrow.
So what? Four cards is better than usual?
Oh, this is so you can contact me. It has my number in it.
Okay.
And…
Hey.
It looks good on you.
I'll see you tomorrow.
This is an announcement for all Kabukicho visitors.
Recently, there have been incidents of fraudulent soliciting in Kabukicho…
Ouch!
What was that?
Hello? Today?
Now?
Well, I'm in Kabukicho right now.
Where are you?
Oh, okay. Then…
What's wrong with him?
There's a weird guy here…
I understand you better than anyone.
Really?
Then let me hear it…
What's going on?
Sorry!
-Hey! -What's wrong with you?
-Sorry… -You stink.
Hey.
Boss…
What are you winking at? You bastard!
No, I didn't mean to…
You...
No…
Boss, he's a civilian. What if he goes to the police?
It doesn't matter.
Don't move.
How about if I cut off your pinkie…
No…
No…
How many am I at?
He's the 77th.
Wait.
You can't.
What are you doing?
That's your own finger!
Don't do it!
Wait! Put down that sickle-like thing. Okay?
Sickle?
Yeah.
Hey, what did you do?
No, just stop. Calm down.
Don't hurt yourself.
-Okay? -You bastard!
What did you say?
Boss!
What's going on?
Boss!
Stay back!
-What's wrong? -Boss…
What's the matter?
I said stay back!
Hey!
-Boss! -What did you do?
Hurry up! Let's go! Come on!
Do you believe me?
Let's assume I do believe you.
Don't give me that crap.
Wow, this is amazing!
I didn't tell you,
but studies abroad say 36% who did trepanation felt a sixth sense.
It's more common for people to feel nothing!
-What else didn't you tell me? -Hey, Nakoshi…
What about me?
How do I look to you?
What?
I don't see anything.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
You said you believe me, didn't you?
What's wrong?
DAY THREE
When I saw this, it all made sense.
What's that?
It's a homunculus.
Homunculus?
Yes.
Basically, it is a man-made human being created using alchemy.
However, a neurosurgeon named Penfield
used the word "homunculus" to refer to a miniature human inside the brain.
Its hands and lips are huge.
Since we were born,
we've used our hands and mouths in order to feel something.
Sex is a good example of that.
But it looks nothing like the monsters I saw.
For example, we use the expression "He's lacking substance," right?
That describes this man perfectly.
No. He was kind of fat…
What's key is that this is a person's source of mental stress.
That's the issue.
Well, they might lack substance, but aren't you jumping to conclusions?
It's one interpretation.
I think they're the self-images that each individual has of themselves.
After all, the homunculi you saw were not all the same simple shape, right?
In other words, since we activated your brain through the surgery,
you've gained the ability to visualize people's deep sources of stress.
In other words, trauma?
Yes, that's it! That's right!
Trauma is created from past emotions and memories.
That's what you're able to see.
Then why can some people see homunculi, but others can't?
That's what we're going to find out.
We're going to create hypotheses and verify them. Experimentation.
Is this really going to be over in a week?
I don't want to spend my whole life seeing monsters.
You're no fun…
You're experiencing something amazing right now!
You can see inside people's hearts.
I'm so jealous.
That's it.
Let's go out now and test out your new ability.
-Go ahead. -Okay.
Are there any here?
I'm leaving.
Rumors say this place has real high school students.
It's like a modern freakshow.
You like monsters like her?
Huh?
Found one.
She's a sand monster.
Sand?
You mean that girl?
I'm going to make direct contact with her.
Did you think of something?
If she's made up of dry sand, I'll just have to make her wet.
You just want to fuck a high school student.
No.
I want to fuck a homunculus.
You're disgusting.
Hello.
Are you alone?
Are you studying?
You're shaking.
Are you perhaps…
Hey, are you okay?
Too bad. She ran away.
No, that's not what I mean.
Your face.
-My face? -Yeah.
I swiped this.
You stole it?
Hold onto it. If anything happens, report it to me.
Thanks.
You're shaking.
Hey…
What are you so scared about?
Are you perhaps…
a virgin?
MOM: Where are you? Call me if you're running late.
MOM: Why aren't you picking up?
MOM: Don't you have to study?
MOM: You're not smart like Kaede.
MOM: Where are you?
MOM: Call me!
1775.YUKARI
FILL ME UP…
I'M SO DIRTY…
NOTICE ME, FIND ME…
JUST THE WAY I AM…
DIRTY FEELINGS…
HELP ME.
NEED ME.
WANT ME.
TOUCH ME.
Geez…
"When I become one with you,
-everything becomes real." -…everything becomes real.
When I become one with you,
I become one.
Soon, I want to become one.
That's so creepy.
Hey.
We've been looking for you.
-No, wait… -Come on! Hey!
-Wait! -You bastard!
Yesterday…
what did you do to me?
Well…
I saw something.
You saw something?
What did you see?
A robot.
A robot?
Does that mean anything to you?
Something about a pinkie and a sickle…
I have no idea whatsoever.
Oh.
Sorry.
Hey. What are you doing?
A child…
Sorry…
Don't move!
Stay back!
I'll cut off your pinkie!
There he is!
What are you talking about?
What a wound…
Ouch!
Sorry!
That must have hurt, huh?
Yeah…
You bastard! Hey!
This will cost you more than just a finger.
What is this?
What's this feeling?
What the hell are you doing?
When you were a kid,
what did you do to your pinkie with the sickle?
Oh, wow! It's a sickle!
Whoa! Hey! Let me see!
No! I'll trade you for that.
Huh? No way.
Stop it!
You bastard!
I see…
Guilt.
You're not the one who got hurt with the sickle.
You hurt someone else.
No!
-What's the big deal? -No!
-Let me see it! -No way!
-No! -Come on!
-No! I don't want to! -Hey!
-Stop! -Give it to me!
No!
Kazuo…
Kazuo!
Kazuo!
Kazuo!
No!
You were scared
and couldn't apologize.
Right?
-I… -I…
-did that to Kazuo's pinkie… -did that to Kazuo's pinkie…
-Kazuo, -Kazuo,
-I'm sorry! -I'm sorry!
I'm sorry…
-I'm sorry! -I'm sorry!
-I'm sorry! -I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
The only thing you could do was cover up your regret and your sin.
You deliberately hurt people…
and accepted your loneliness…
Your guilt…
turned you into a yakuza.
As of today, I'm quitting the yakuza.
Allow me to compensate for what I've done.
We hadn't seen Ken around for a while,
so I went to check his tent, but he was already cold.
An-chan, he taught you lots of things when you first got here too, right?
What is this?
Hey, An-chan.
Hey.
I heard you got your car back.
Yeah.
Let's have a drink.
Yeah?
Okay.
I see.
An insurance company?
Yes.
I calculated probabilities whenever someone wanted to buy life insurance.
For example,
that guy in the suit eating a piece of bread.
60 million yen max.
That family over there,
no more than 80 million for the father, and for the mother, 38 million.
And 48 million just for the kid.
That's more than 100 million.
Well, it's just a rough estimate,
but every life has a monetary value assigned to it.
What a bunch of rubbish!
Who decides stuff like that?
Ryo.
How old are you?
I'm 41.
Forty-one.
How often do you drink?
Wh-What you see here.
Every day.
Do you smoke?
No, I don't.
Have you ever had any major diseases?
No,
but I had appendicitis once.
Do your parents, siblings, or any of your relatives have any hereditary disorders?
Well… um…
Oh, and what's your income every year?
-What? Even if you ask me… -Well,
an approximation is fine.
That comes out to…
Ryo, your value is--
You idiot!
Don't decide how much someone's worth!
Don't put a price on someone's life!
Calm down!
Calm down!
Hey, take it easy!
The moon is the moon…
Ouch…
Hello?
You want me to give you your phone back, right?
Just tell me where to bring it.
Okay.
I'll be going now. Thanks for the food.
Hey, you have my phone, right?
Yeah.
Hey! Don't just get in without asking!
MOM: Where are you?
Looking out for your mother?
You checked my phone, didn't you?
Give it back to me.
Gross.
You work with that pimply guy, don't you?
So what if I do?
Is this where you live?
Do you work?
You don't?
What a half-assed loser.
"When I become one with you, everything becomes real."
You did check my phone.
"When I become one with you,
I'm freed from this world.
When I become one with you,
I become one.
Soon…"
Stop!
"I want to become one!"
Stop!
This… isn't sand…
They're symbols?
Pervy old man…
PERVY OLD MAN
Wh-What's all this?
Let go of me!
Ouch…
What are you trying to do?
Hey!
Hey, what are you thinking?
What are you trying to do?
Being a virgin is embarrassing.
Are you crazy?
You want to fuck me, right?
You…
That's so gross…
What a half-assed loser…
You're the one who's a loser!
Do you understand what you're doing?
If I become one with you,
everything becomes real…
Sex is your only way of rebelling against your parents.
You're holding onto a shitty fantasy.
Please.
Be gentle with me.
Stop!
Seriously, what are you doing?
I am you.
I AM YOU
I'm not like you!
Wait a minute--
What's that?
Hey! Stop!
Don't look!
Don't look!
Stop!
Don't look!
You're finally showing your true colors…
Stop!
No!
Spit it out!
Give it back! It's mine!
It hurts!
It hurts!
It hurts! It's hot!
You became human.
It hurts!
What are you doing? It hurts!
MOM
What in the world are you thinking going out so late?
I know.
You have a boyfriend, don't you?
I told you to talk to me about it.
To go that far--
That's…
What are you going to do?
How can they do that here?
They didn't get a proper education.
Don't mess up my car.
What are you talking about?
It's so pretty.
DAY FOUR
Not again…
Hey…
Hey!
Bring me Ito!
I said get the medical intern Ito out here right now!
Excuse me. Can I have your name?
I'm his patient.
Please wait over there.
Empty.
What?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Sorry.
Nakoshi.
Don't come without contacting first.
-Tell me what's going on! -Calm down.
Something happened, huh?
I thought you didn't give strangers rides.
You're not a stranger anymore.
Homunculi are warped elements locked up in the back of the subconscious.
That's why they look so weird.
I see.
Your brain regained the sensitivity of a child's mind
while retaining the knowledge and experience of an adult.
Your rare sixth sense has saved two people!
This is a fantastic achievement that'll revolutionize psychotherapy!
Well, if they disappeared, then why are they part of my body?
About that, please have a look at this.
Could that woman see homunculi, too?
Who knows?
This picture is a self-portrait she drew.
The homunculi transferred…
This is the first thing I thought of when I heard your story.
I told you that some people can see homunculi and others can't, right?
Yeah.
For example, people with similar interests are drawn to each other.
If minds have similar problems, their homunculi are drawn to each other.
In other words,
the yakuza and high school girl may seem different from you,
but maybe your mind has similarities.
You must be joking. I'm not a monster like them.
But their stress disappeared, right?
And it's been transferred to you.
Feeling guilty, living according to someone else's rules…
Does it sound familiar?
Your own problems have begun to surface.
My problems?
That woman in red with the flat face.
You felt something different about her, right?
You're looking at the homunculi,
but the homunculi are looking at you too.
You know what that means, right?
It means that you, yourself, are a homunculus.
So? What's this woman doing now?
She committed suicide.
Did you already know that?
Yes.
She drew this picture before she died.
Close it.
Huh? But it's only been four days. Stop joking.
Just hurry up and close it now!
Y-You've turned into a completely different person.
Nakoshi, have you noticed it?
You weren't this emotional four days ago.
You said you didn't care if you turned into a vegetable.
That's why I told you…
I'd give you a reason to live in seven days…
I will not die with those monsters!
Okay, I understand!
In exchange, I have one condition.
Before I close the hole,
please look at my homunculus.
I told you.
I didn't see anything.
-Nakoshi. -What?
I know when you're lying.
Do you see yourself…
inside me too?
Nakoshi.
Don't be stupid.
Your own problems have begun to surface.
That woman in red with the flat face.
You felt something different about her, right?
SUSUMU NAKOSHI, ENGAGEMENT MANAGER CONSULTING DEPARTMENT
NANAKO
Nanako…
Do you have a business card?
Wow…
-Mao, want mine? -Handsome with a Porsche.
-I don't want it. -What a catch.
-Seriously! -Yeah.
Aren't you being too forward?
Any girl would want him.
There's more to a man than just money. He should be accepting, too.
Yeah.
Can you live off of being accepting?
-You can. -Yeah.
But Nakoshi has everything.
Yeah, you're right.
Even if the guy's accepting,
if he's ugly and doesn't have a stable job, what's the point?
Nice to meet you. I'm Nakoshi.
What's your name?
NANAKO
Empty.
Nakoshi! Let's go drink some more!
Nakoshi!
Nakoshi?
-Hey! Nakoshi! -Nakoshi!
Nanako.
DAY FIVE
Nanako!
Huh?
You're Nanako, right?
What's wrong?
I'm not sure.
Huh?
I've lost my memory.
Do you… know me?
I want you to come with me.
ITO
You don't have to answer that?
Yeah. It's fine.
Did I live here?
"Empty."
Huh?
When we first met…
that's what you told me.
With that one word,
I was saved.
I, too…
had forgotten who I was.
But…
when I found you…
I remembered.
Here.
Is this…
mine?
You… used to like it.
Did we…
live together?
Yeah.
We were happy
living together,
Nanako.
Nanako?
Nanako, what's wrong?
Are you okay?
Nanako.
-Nanako. -No.
I don't remember anything.
Nanako, calm down.
Nanako.
Nanako.
Take it slow.
Am I…
Nanako?
Yes.
You…
are Nanako.
DAY SIX
I can't see it.
I can't see it…
No way…
Hey!
It's me!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey…
Hello?
It's been a while.
Where are you?
That's what I want to ask you. You ignored my calls.
Oh, and don't mess up my room.
Are you the one who did trepanation on Nanako?
I wasn't expecting this.
What a surprise. I never imagined that you'd run into her.
Why didn't you tell me?
Well, that's a good question.
But the answer is none of your business.
Of course it's my business!
Nakoshi, please calm down.
It would be boring if I explained everything to you.
Today's the sixth day.
The experiment you promised to do isn't over yet.
I got myself back.
And the other homunculus parts have disappeared.
Too bad.
I can't see homunculi anymore.
Your experiment is over.
Oh, really?
That's good.
Thanks to you, I've just about proved my hypothesis.
You've proved it?
Of course, it's all reality to you.
I'm not denying that.
You saved your dear girlfriend and got together again.
And you can't see homunculi anymore, right?
What are you trying to say?
Nakoshi,
maybe this world is nothing more than an illusion created by the brain.
I mean, I said that you yourself might be a homunculus, right?
The homunculi show you what you want to see.
Everything is just your own imagination.
No, that can't be true.
I'm sure I saw it.
No.
It means that this world is a convenient illusion created by the brain.
You see?
Well, I don't mean to destroy your happy ending…
but the real her is going to remember everything soon.
She's going to remember the real world.
Remember?
What's this "real world" bullshit? What are you thinking?
You might find out that some memories shouldn't be remembered.
What exactly are you trying to say?
Nakoshi, don't you have any idea what I'm talking about?
You saw her homunculus too, right?
Yeah.
I saw it.
She was in red…
But that was only in your world.
Unlike you, nothing happened to her after she underwent trepanation.
So my experiment went no further.
But she brought about an unexpected turn of events.
Because she met you.
But you can't see homunculi anymore.
And you can't protect her.
Unfortunately, the thing that was wrong was your brain itself.
H-Hey…
Nanako…
Ito?
I knew it was you…
Right, Chihiro?
Chihiro?
Nanako.
But the real her is going to remember everything soon.
She's going to remember the real world.
Nanako…
Hey…
Who are you?
Who… are you?
No!
No…
-Nanako… -Let go of me!
No…
I want to see the real you. I have to see it!
Okay?
It'd be better if you didn't know the real me!
I want to know the real you anyway!
Okay?
Nanako!
I killed her…
The one who killed Nanako…
was me.
I've told you over and over again!
You did tell me!
But I didn't think my mom would be that mad.
You should have known!
She's always like that, like at the funeral the other day.
That was different.
Different?
-How is it different? -Shut up!
You're such a pain.
I've had enough.
What are you doing, Chihiro?
Stop! What are you doing?
Nanako!
Nanako…
Nanako…
I didn't want to remember…
No…
You're…
empty.
Hey, over here! The annular solar eclipse!
Look!
Oh, it was today.
Yeah!
Oh…
They're overlapping.
It's coming.
Look.
I'm not…
Nanako.
Nanako…
-What happened? -Don't touch me!
Please, Nanako, calm down.
Were you paying any attention to me?
You never change.
I bet you wouldn't cry even if I died!
You never change.
You are empty.
PRECAUTIONS FOR DAILY LIFE AFTER MISCARRIAGE
Nanako!
Nanako, wait!
Stop!
Nanako, let's talk!
Let me go!
Nanako!
Nanako…
Nanako…
I've wanted to apologize…
I've wanted to say…
I'm sorry.
What is…
your name?
Chihiro.
Chihiro…
Chihiro…
Wow, Nakoshi. That was amazing.
You even saved the woman who did this to you.
I wasn't expecting that.
Can you say "I love you" to the woman before you now?
The feelings inside of you are for Nanako, right?
My experiment got derailed.
It's just an illusion created by a misunderstanding!
And yet,
you're comforting each other.
You're projecting yourself onto others and getting high off the feeling.
Are you okay with that?
I thought you didn't want to die with a monster.
Hey.
Why are you getting so worked up?
What is it about me…
that you want to deny so badly?
The connection between myself and others…
It's the homunculi, right?
No. When are you going to wake up?
Water.
Huh?
You're…
made of water.
Well, at first glance, you're invisible.
But when you get nervous,
there are bubbles.
Yeah. Here they come now.
Over there, too.
There, too.
No! I told you!
It's nothing more than an illusion--
I can finally see you.
No…
What do you mean?
This is…
Oh…
It's your father.
So it was hiding there?
The goldfish.
He kept it as a pet when I was a kid. It was his only hobby--
Did you… like that goldfish?
Why are you asking me that?
Where's this goldfish now?
Your father…
Between you and the goldfish,
who did your father cherish more?
Oh…
It's coming out.
It has no eyes.
It can't see.
He won't look at you.
"Look at me."
You want him to look at you…
but he won't.
Nakoshi…
Look at me closer!
Please.
The homunculus is gone.
You're lying!
Help me…
You're the only one…
who can see me.
I've finally found you…
It has to be…
It has to be you…
The homunculi aren't the problem.
We both…
only wanted to be seen.
We didn't try to see the other person.
When you look at the other person…
you can create the world.

Oh, man! Ooh!
Dora the Explorer!
Dora! Diego! It's time for dinner.
But, Mami, we're about to explore.
No. Now come on.
Besides, Diego has to be up early tomorrow.
He's moving to the city, remember? His mom has a new job.
Oh, yeah. I remember.
Dora, what did we say about dressing up Boots?
He's a wild monkey, honey. He's not meant to be in human clothes.
-[Cole] This is delicious! -[Diego] Wow, this is good.
-Mm! Delicioso! -Delicioso!
-[Elena chuckles] -Can you say "delicioso"?
Say delicioso!
She-- She'll grow out of it.
Delicioso!
[Elena] Don't start. Just gotta let it go.
Tío, what is Parapata?
Parapata is a great Inca legend.
An ancient city…
now lost in time.
[Elena] Explorers for hundreds of years have been searching for it in vain.
And, well, ever since we moved here to the jungle,
we've been trying to find it.
Is there gold there?
Stories say there's more gold there than the rest of the world combined.
So when we find it, do we get to keep the gold?
-Um-- -No, no. Nobody keeps the gold.
We want to document Parapata for archeological purposes.
See, we're explorers, we're not treasure hunters.
And as explorers, well, then the discovery of new places…
that's the treasure.
-What? -I don't get it.
Okay, Cole, honey, they're six.
Uh, treasure hunting bad, exploring good.
-Oh. -Okay. I just said that!
Eh. Not really.
[Diego] I bet the lost city of Parapata has golden statues of jungle cats.
And monkeys. Like Boots. Monkeys are the best.
No way! Jaguars are way cooler.
Monkeys can swing and climb and talk to us.
No, they can't. Boots isn't talking to you.
He can talk.
I know better! I'm older than you.
I think you're just yelling at me because you're sad you're leaving.
Of course that's why I'm yelling at you.
Keep this. Best friends forever.
Until our next adventure, prima.
Till our next adventure, primo.
-[Nico] Come on, Diego. -[Sabrina] Vamos.
[Nico] Adiós, Dora.
Diego!
Hi! I'm Dora! And I'm being chased by a herd of angry pygmy elephants.
Can you say, "angry pygmy elephants"?
[Dora] Better luck next time, angry elephants.
Pardon me, black caiman…
largest predator in the Amazon.
Aw, babies.
[laughs] Bye!
-[Boots squeals] -And that's Boots! Hi, Boots.
"Hi, Dora. What's today's adventure?"
Today, we continue our decades-long search for Parapata.
Oh, look!
Golden poison frog.
Its skin is lethally toxic and can cause full-body paralysis.
Can you say, "severe neurotoxicity"?
-Bye, deadly frog. Have a nice day. -[Boots squeals]
-Oh! A rockfall! -[Boots squeals]
This cave wasn't here before.
Sorry, hairy-legged vampire bat family.
Oh.
Ancient Inca.
-[Boots gasps] -Parapata.
-Come on, Boots. -[Boots chitters]
If you just believe in yourself, anything is possible.
I'm okay, Boots!
Uh. Could you maybe go and get Mami and Papi for me?
Hey, now can I see the statue?
-Did you finish chopping the wood? -Yeah.
Honey, you scared us to death today. If Boots hadn't found us--
I'm sorry. It's just I'm pretty sure it's from the reign of Pachacuti.
I mean, the markings, they look like some sort of…
-[both] Map. -What?
[Dora] A map!
This is it.
This is the missing piece.
We found Parapata! [laughs]
Wait, why aren't you guys… -more excited? -Uh…
-You guys figured it out, didn't you? -What?
-You know where Parapata is. -No.
[sighs] You red-tacked it.
-We did? Oh… -We never use the red tack.
-You know where it is! -We should have waited on the red tack.
-You know where it is! -We should have waited on the red tack. -Definitely, definitely bad call. -Okay, we did figure it out.
-Definitely, definitely bad call. -Okay, we did figure it out.
-[laughs] -The Inca reached an area in Peru that nobody thought was possible.
And that's where your mother and I are gonna find Parapata.
And me.
I'm sorry, sweetie, you're just not ready, and you proved that to us today.
No, no, no, I'm ready, Mami-- I'm sorry, but we've made up our minds.
-Mami-- -No.
Honey…
you do know the jungle. It's a part of you.
-But you're all alone out there. -And why is that a bad thing?
Because we won't always be there to pull you up.
Go to the city. Make friends.
[Elena] Dora, hurry! You have a flight to catch.
[Dora] But I don't want to go to the city.
-I won't know anyone there. -You'll know your family.
Yeah, you used to be so close to Diego. I'll bet he's missed you, too.
-[sighs] -The point is, I think it would be good
for you to be in the world around kids your own age.
-It-- It might help. -Help what?
Honey, you're wearing a boa around your neck.
I know.
-It's a boa, as a boa. -That's funny.
Put the boa down.
[Elena] Honey, there's something else we gotta discuss.
-I can handle this. -Okay.
Take a seat, young lady.
-What's happening? -[Elena] Come on.
-[sighs] -We're gonna have a talk. About the dangers of the big city.
See, you're gonna be invited to some parties.
And some of these parties, they're-- they're called "raves."
The people there are called ravers.
Yeah, and they-- they love glow sticks
and candy necklaces and Hacky Sacks.
The music is-- It sounds like this.
-♪ Can't stop it ♪ -[imitating dance beat]
-♪ Go get it ♪ -[imitates loud dance beat]
Yeah, it's very aggressive. Very aggressive.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well-- Well, be careful. That-- That's what we want to say.
-I should've just said that. -I think it would've been easier.
Honey, here's your satellite phone. Call us anytime.
And you can track our coordinates on your map.
-But it's not the same. -[Elena sighs]
I'm an explorer, like you.
Oh, honey, you have the whole world to explore!
Go see it.
Make friends. That's real exploring.
But…
I don't know how.
Yes, you do.
Just be yourself, Dora. Okay?
Come on. You're gonna miss your flight.
Te quiero.
-Dora, no monkeys in the city. -[Boots groans]
-[sighs] She knows, buddy. -[groans]
[chuckles] Wow!
Hi! I'm Dora! ¡Soy Dora! [chatter]
I'm Dora! Hi!
It's nice to meet you. Hi!
-Do you see her? -No.
What if we don't recognize her?
[Dora] Excuse me! Sorry!
-Excuse me! Sorry! -[man] Hey, watch it!
-I don't think that's gonna be a problem. -Excuse me! Sorry!
Dora! Welcome to the city.
Tía Sabrina!
-And Tío Nico! -[Nico] Dora!
Hi! I missed you guys so much.
-And Diego! -Uh. Hi.
Wow! [laughs]
Wow! You're so skinny and tall! Like a palmito tree.
You don't even look like you.
-Um. Thank you? -We're gonna have so much fun!
You are way more energetic -than I remember. -[both laugh]
Let's go!
-Ah, Dora. [speaks Spanish] -Abuelita!
Oh, I missed you!
Look at you! Such a big girl! And still with the bangs.
Wow! [laughs] It's so pink.
And everything matches.
Yeah, my parents thought you'd like it.
Hey, I brought you something.
What is that?
The candy bar that we split before you left the jungle. Remember?
Where's yours?
Well, I probably ate it.
Like ten years ago.
Sorry. I'm--
I just thought that we were gonna mush them back together again.
It's cool.
This is gonna be great! [chuckles]
Okay. Well, uh…
you should get some sleep.
Good night, prima.
Buenas noches, primo.
Okay.

Ranching and agriculture are some of the greatest threats facing the Amazon today.
But I believe that with focused conservation and plant-based diets, we can help the rainforests thrive again.

Okay, let's see who did the reading last night.
Who is Moby Dick
and why is this story still significant today?
Oh.
Thank God. Someone else.
You're new, yes?
Well, say hello.
Hola. I'm Dora. I'm Diego's cousin.
And Moby Dick is a whale.
The novel exemplifies the Western writer's nostalgic appropriation of colonized indigenous cultures,

which explains its reified status in American fiction today.
Where did you transfer from, Dora?
-The jungle. -[laughter]
My parents are both professors. I do a lot of reading.

[teacher] Thank you, Dora.
It looks like we have a new star in the class.

I see it. I'm not stupid. I--
But-- But I have to be myself. That's all I know how to do.
Well, just stop doing it.
For, like, one day just stop being you and just be normal.
Diego, we used to be so close. Why are things so different now?
Because, Dora, this isn't the jungle, where you can just do whatever you want
and be best friends with a monkey.
Okay? This is high school. It's life or death.
And it was hard enough already without having to take care of the class weirdo.
Dora?
Dora?
Okay.
Sometimes we all need to hide. No?
[sighs] I guess, I never felt lonely

But now that I'm surrounded by kids…
I feel alone all the time.

No.

-[Dora] Can I be on your team? -[Sammy] Do you guys need a fourth person?
[Diego] Hey, guys, us four?
[Dora] Can I be on your team?
-[Diego] Hey, guys. -[Dora] Can I be on your team?
[scoffs] You've got to be kidding me.
Of course, this is happening.
There's something really icy happening between you two.
-Was it the Disco Dork-a dance? -Well, I'm glad you brought it up--
-Was it the Disco Dork-a dance? -Well, I'm glad you brought it up-- I'm just kidding, I don't actually care.
Okay. "Find something that's more than 1,000 years old."
"Oldest relic gets two extra points." Come on!
Oh, my gosh. Could you be any bossier?
-Excuse me? "Bossier." Really? -Yeah.
What's next? "Shrill?" Or am I being too difficult for you?
You left that out of your Misogyny 101 class.
What? Do you have something to say?
I'm just so scared right now.
[Dora] Hey, what about this Egyptian exhibit?
Anything Egyptian would be the oldest relic by far.
-Guys? -Psst.
I think I may be able to help you.
Overheard about your scavenger hunt.
You were looking at the Egyptian posters.
-When does it open? -Oh, that's the problem, two weeks.
They're unloading it today in the basement.
Look…
If it means that much to you, there may be a way for you to get down there.
[Sammy] This best not be some wild goose chase.
I sure hope it is. I love chasing wild geese.
Until you catch one. Then it is not fun.
A caught goose is just the meanest!
Well, it's grouped by origin, so
Well, it's grouped by origin, so the Ancient Egyptian stuff should be in this aisle.
-Hi. -Oh, no, she's been caught!
And I can totally explain why I'm here.
-Someone's coming. -Come with me, miss.
Hide! Hide!
-Where? -There, there, there!
Look what I found sneaking around.
Ah. An interloper.
A thief.
Or maybe an explorer.
-Hola, Dora. -Hi, I'm Dora, and--
-Wait, you already knew my name? -[footsteps approach]
Hey. You gotta help me.
I guess we win the scavenger hunt.
What? Hey, no.
Let me go!
-Hey, no! -Wait, wait, wait, wait.
-[Diego] What's going on? -[Randy] Is this a scavenger hunt?
[Dora] What are you guys doing in here?
Sleep tight, Dora, and when you wake up,
you will help us find your parents, and then Parapata.
What's happening?
Where are we?
I think we're being unloaded from a plane.
We're not on a plane. We can't--
Oh, my God, we're on a plane! Oh--
We've left the country without ID. We need to alert the US consulate.
Dora, what happened?
-They're treasure hunters? -Why did I take Mandarin?
-They're treasure hunters? -Why did I take Mandarin? -What are you guys saying? -[whirring, clattering]
We gotta get out of here.
Oh, look, Dora brought a knife on the field trip, everybody.
I see three mercenaries. Armed.
Wait, there's a fourth.
I think he saw me.
-He's coming for us. -Ah!
Okay. I am not here. I'm an avatar. [whimpers]
Dora! It is you!
-Who are you? -I'm a friend of your parents.
I'm rescuing you, Dora!
Come with me if you want to live--
-[Sammy] Where did he go? -Did… did he die?
I'm okay! I'm okay. I need your help.
But we have to run. Now!
-[woman] Boss! -Get them!
[Sammy] My parents did not sign a permission slip for the jungle!
Why are we here?
Where's the museum? Why, why, why?
-[Dora] How do we get out of here? -I don't know!
Getting you out of the box was as far as my plan went. Huh?
Huh! Swiper, at the ready!
Whatever happens, get that map.
Swiper, yes, swiping.
-[Diego] What kind of rescue is this? -It's the only one you've got.
[Dora] Here. Let me try.
Hola. What the--
[Dora] Hey! That fox just swiped my map!
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?
What part of, "The fox just swiped my map" don't you understand? Come on, help me!
Gotcha! There you are, my little friend.
No swiping, you… you swiper!
Yeah, oh! Oh! [moaning]
Oh!
She's amazing.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh-oh!
-[Swiper screams] -Oh, shoot!
Man! I'm stuck upside-down.
Swiper, no-- [gasps]
-Good job, Swiper. -I know, man.
Get her!
[Diego] Dora!
-Now what do we do? -Come on, come on!
-Where did our rescuer go? -[Randy] He ran away!
-Get in! -[Swiper] Open this door, man!
-[man] Get in! -[Swiper] I'm not joking, man!
Viper, get the truck! Don't let them escape!
-Hold on! -[Diego] Oh!
[man] Sorry!
Are they following?
[mercenary] Where have they gone?
This is the only road for miles. Keep your eyes peeled.
Not anymore. [sighs]
Are you kids okay?
-Not really. -"Not really"?
Understatement of the century.
I was just kidnapped and chased by bad guys!
And a fox with a mask! Everyone saw that, right?
Like, why does that fox need to remain anonymous?
Who is gonna recognize one specific fox?
-Mm. -How did you know my name?
You were an infant the last time I saw you.
My name is Alejandro Gutierrez. I'm a professor of ancient languages
My name is Alejandro Gutierrez. I'm a professor of ancient languages at San Marcos University in Lima, Peru.
Your parents and I were in constant contact during their time here.
Then two weeks ago, your parents' calls stopped.
Since then… silencio.
-That means silence. -Yeah. I got that one.
They haven't answered any of my sat phone call for weeks, either.
Your father sent me this just a week before, in case I could help.
Ah, Papi's journal!
[Alejandro] So I came here to make sure they were okay.
Tracked them this far.
I've been staking it out, hoping for a sign from them.
[stutters] And then I saw you poke your head out of that crate
and I-- I said to myself, "Dora!"
Dora the kidnapped teenager!
But how did you recognize me?
Well, you look sort of exactly the same.
But I'm afraid I have no idea where to find your parents.
Don't worry. I can track my parents in the jungle.
-Let's go! -Ho… Hold up.
Or we could call the local police
and-- and have them come rescue us with, like, a SWAT team.
Hmm. Yeah, that sounds like another solid option.
Of course!
Hello? 911? Can you please come and get us?
We're at the corner of Rain and Forest.
Okay, I get it! I just want to go home.
We're gonna die out here.
Look around you.
This is the kind of place where people die.
I mean, in a way, every place is the kind of place where people die.
-Okay, well, that's a bummer notion. -Guys, guys.
Listen, finding Dora's parents is our best chance of getting home.
My aunt and uncle will know what to do.
Dora's my cousin, I can't just let her go off with some
strange and anxious man we just met.
Thank you, Diego.
Now let's go find Dora's parents.
[Dora] Look! In there! That's their car!
Here. This is it. Our family symbol.
-This is where they started hiking. -Are we there?
Where are your parents? I don't see your parents.
We can't go any further by car.
-The jungle gets too dense. -So, how do we--
We must enter the jungle on foot.
Luckily, I prepared for this possibility.
Okay, I may have gone a little overboard on supplies.
Be my guest.
This is a legit nightmare!
I-- I'm not going in first, though. You go first, Dora. It feels right.
[Dora] You all have nothing to worry about.
The jungle is perfectly safe!
Just don't touch anything. Or breathe too deeply.
[Randy] Are you sure your parents went this way?
[Sammy] Okay, what are these?
Warning signs.
Totems.
Legend tells of a deadly ancient militia
dedicated to protecting Parapata from outside eyes.
No one has seen Los Guardianes Perdidos…
The Lost Guardians, for centuries.
-What was that? -Quechua.
-Ancient Inca. Impressive. -[Sammy] What does it mean?
"All those that seek Parapata…
shall surely perish."
Okay, I am ready for my parents to come and get me now.
[Alejandro] You have nothing to worry about.
I promise. I mean, there's no need to overreact.
Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! [grunts]
And that was just an example of the dangers of overreacting.
-[Sammy whimpers] -[Dora] You okay? Fine. Totally fine.
Hey. I found one of those red loops.
My parents' symbol.
-We must be getting close. -Oh, thank you, thank you!
We're going home.
This is my parents' camp.
Or was. I mean, this is their stuff.
-Someone's watching. -[rustling]
[Sammy] I can feel it.
-Kill it! Quickly, kill it! -Boots! Oh!
Oh, Boots, I'm so happy to see you!
She knows this monkey?
Of course, she knows this monkey.
[sighs] Thank goodness.
-He saw them. -[Boots squeals]
Oh, sorry. Um, this is Boots. Boots, these are, um, my friends.
-They're here to help me. -No. We're here to get saved.
Oh, and FYI, we are not friends.
They did this quickly.
-See how they rushed it? -Yeah.
Still, I can track my parents better than any mercenaries.
We just have to get to them first.
Uh. May we stop for a moment? I need to do a thing.
-What? -Just a thing.
What thing?
I know what this is.
-You have to poo. -[scoffs] No. That isn't it.
Of course I have to poo! I haven't pooed in 48 hours!
I'm sweating, and every step is agony!
Well, don't look at me cover your ears!
Probably should've said "cover your ears" before you said "poo" like, 47 times.
-[scoffs] -[Dora] There's no need to be afraid.
I have an idea.
-Let's turn this into a song. -Let's not.
You know what? I think it's passed.
Why don't we just go back to the group, and we can just--
Seriously? You had that in your backpack, too?
A poo shovel.
♪ It's time to dig the poo hole ♪
-♪ Dig, dig, dig ♪ -[Boots hums]
♪ Just grab a shovel It's a piece of cake ♪
♪ Make sure the hole is deep And there isn't a snake ♪
♪ I'm telling you this So you will be wiser ♪
♪ And don't forget It's a natural fertilizer ♪
I believe in you, Sammy. I believe that you can do this.
Also, medically, you have to do this.
-[exhales] -Okay, bye! Come on, Boots.
She's good.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Not good. Not good at all.
-Go, go, go! -[Randy screams]
Real arrows flying at us! Real arrows flying at us!
♪ Dig the poo hole ♪
♪ Dig, dig, dig ♪
-[Dora] Run! -Look away! Look away!
-Sorry, no time! -We saw nothing!
-Run for your life! -We gotta go!
-[Sammy] What is happening? -It's the curse!
The curse is gonna perish us. We're gonna perish all over the place!
There, there! Follow me!
[Dora] This way!
I'm hit! They hit me! I'm bleeding out!
I am losing life force!
Oh, no, no, no! No, it's a juice box. It's just a juice box.
I think we're safe. For now.
-[Sammy screams] -Not safe. Not safe! Not safe!
[Randy] I want to go home! I want to go home!
I'm okay! I'm okay!
[Alejandro] Guys…
I can't say for sure…
because I'm… I'm fairly confident I just sustained a… a serious brain injury, but I do believe…
a serious brain injury, but I do believe…
we may have just met Los Guardianes Perdidos.
The Lost Guardians.
[Diego] I thought you said they were just legends.
These are the same Inca sun symbols that were on those totems.
So these are like, legit arrows?
Like, kill-people arrows?
[Alejandro] The markings are quite authentic.
Hey, you okay?
"Okay?"
Okay? No, I'm not okay, okay? I want to go home!
I want to be staring at my phone, in an ice-cold room,
drinking a frozen coffee beverage!
And I know that makes me sound real basic, but that is what I want!
Oh, and by the way, the poo song lied.
Yeah, it was totally dangerous, arrows rained down on me.
I hate it here!
Uh! Uh! And I can't even storm off 'cause this jungle will eat me!
Maybe a song will help.
♪ It's okay to freak out sometimes ♪
-♪ It's really okay… ♪ -No more songs!
Okay.
Are you here to yell at me, too?
Nah. Actually, I'm here to avoid getting yelled at.
It's scary to be responsible for other people.
It's easier when you're alone.
Is it?
Look, I know she can be like, a real pain in the butt sometimes, but…
she's not all bad, I guess.
You have an attraction for her.
What? No.
No, I definitely never said that.
You know, a life-threatening situation
can often accelerate the mating process in many species!
Okay, no. Just slow your roll.
And please don't ever say the word "mating" again.
-Ever. -Mm. Mm-hmm.
Let's just get out of here.
-Are we even going the right way? -[Boots laughs]
What?
Fox tracks.
[Viper] I scouted the area. There's a freshly cut path to the north,
[Viper] I scouted the area. There's a freshly cut path to the north, some ruins to the east.
[Powell] Did you find any more of their markings?
-[Viper] No. -[Powell] Okay, then we head north. [Viper] That's the path they took.
-Hi, guys! -[all gasp, hush]
[Viper] What was that?
What, you're scared of monkeys now?
[Viper] Monkeys can carry three times their body weight.
So that's a yes? Viper's scared of monkeys.
It's just a monkey fact.
That's all it is.
[Sammy] Where are those guys?
[Randy] They're definitely dead. It's just you and me now.
-Of course, we'll have to start a family. -We are not starting a family.
Eh, give it a few days.
Uh! Hey! Where have you guys been?
-[Alejandro] Hi, guys. -Look, I'm really sorry, Dora.
It's fine. It's fine, Sammy.
We saw the mercenaries. They're ahead of us.
We'll have to follow the mercenaries from a safe distance.
No. We're not following them. My parents didn't go that way.
My father says that the way to Parapata passes through an opera house.
The opera house was built hundreds of years ago
by Europeans during the rubber boom.
There'll be nothing but ruins by now.
This is the way they went.
This must be it.
Or was it.
It doesn't look like any opera singers have been here for a while.
Yeah. [chuckles]
The Europeans may have built it, but…
the jungle has taken it back.
-[farting sound] -Ew, my feet.
Why does the ground feel like chocolate pudding?
-[farting sound] -Excuse me.
-[laughing] -[Alejandro] Wait, wait, wait!
I ate a lot of frijoles and chimichangas. -[farting sound] -[all laughing]
-I ate chile con carne. -[farting sound]
[Alejandro] I ate mucho pozole.
Wait. Anyone else notice the walls are getting higher?
-Quicksand! -[Sammy yelps]
-You got to be kidding me! -[Randy] Quicksand really exists?
I thought it was just a video game thing. Like Pitfall!
-It's a classic. -How do we get out of this stuff?
Okay, rule number one of quicksand, don't panic.
You'll only get sucked in further. Lie down flat on your back.
You have to distribute your weight.
Okay. All right.
[Alejandro] No, no, no. I'm not doing that.
Yeah. No, this feels super wrong.
[Dora] Now make little movements with your legs
to make space for the water to get between the sand.
And once your legs are free, simply backstroke out of the quicksand.
Oh, give me a break. We're gonna die in here.
Look, look! It's working! It's working!
Come on.
Thanks.
-Help me! -Alejandro, you have to stop moving.
-Help me! -Alejandro, you have to stop moving. Stay sti--
Why have you all gone quiet?
It's bad, isn't it? [yelps]
Oh, no! Shoo!
Cha! [spits] No, no, no! Not on the face.
-Not on the face. Ah! [yells in Spanish] -Oh!
-It's another male. They will now fight. -No, no!
I'm not sure those guys are fighting.
Oh, it's a female.
They are not fighting. They are mating!
-Get it off! -Quick, someone go get a branch.
-I'm sinking! -No, no, wait!
Guys, come back!
[Diego] It's a jungle full of trees and I can't find a branch.
[Sammy] Oh, oh, no!
[Dora] Alejandro! Alejandro!
I see feet. Human feet!
Over here!
[Dora yelps] Okay, everyone. One, two, three! Ah!
-I'm alive? -[both] Yes!
-I'm alive! I'm alive! -Yes! Yes!
-I'm alive! I'm alive! [laughing] -Yes! [chuckling]
[sobbing] I'm alive, I'm alive…
I thought I was gonna die.
I thought I was gonna die.
It's so awkward when adults cry.
You just don't know where to look.
And I was stupid!
And then a scorpion went…
mating on my head.
I'm so sorry. My whole life is a lie.
I'm a fraud.
-No! No. -Yes.
Everyone thinks that sometimes, Alejandro.
I'm a bad guy.
-No. -Yes.
-No. No. No. -No, yes, I am. Yes.
-I'm a-- I'm a bad guy! [scoffs] -No!
No, you are not a bad guy. No one is, deep down inside.
-Thank you, Dora. -Come on.
Where are we?
Someone lives here.
And that someone's coming.
She hasn't seen my parents.
And she doesn't seem very interested in helping me find them.
Perhaps she knows how to get to Parapata.
Parapata!
[Sammy yelps] She seemed pretty interested in that.
Are they supposed to be us?
That seemed bad, right?
-Everyone thinks that was bad? -Yeah, a little bit.
What? What did she say?
She said anyone seeking Parapata is cursed.
-Well, that's great. -[Diego sighs]
But she also said she knows how to get you guys back downriver.
-She can take you home. -[scoffs]
All of you.
Yes. Yes! I am saved! I…
Yes. Yes! I am saved! I… mean… [clears throat] …only if you are cool without us, obviously.
mean… [clears throat] …only if you are cool without us, obviously.
You got me into this mess, but I guess you're getting me out of it,
so we'll call it even.
I'm coming with you. I can't let you go alone.
I mean, plus you're my cousin. There's, like, rules about that.
This is where we split up.
Oh, my…
I, uh… I hope you don't die or anything.
You, too.
Is she staring at us?
-Yeah. -Okay, time to go.
Diego, Dora, let's go.
-Hmm? -She says stick to the path.
Oh. Let's go. Bye, guys.
Good luck, Dora.
-[speaking Quechua] -Why is she in such a hurry to get us out of here?
Randy, wait, stop.
Oh, no. Oh, no!
No, no, no, come on! We've got to warn them!
Not something you see every day.
[Alejandro] Are you sure about this?
[Dora] Well, she said this was the way we had to go.
Don't touch anything.
Yes! Yes! Yes! We did it!
[Alejandro] Oops.
-We're in a spore field! -Don't breathe it in!
-We're in a spore field! -Don't breathe it in! -Let's get out of here! -It's okay. It's okay.
-Let's get out of here! -It's okay. It's okay.
If these were poisonous spores, we'd all be dead by now.
Come on, Diego-- Oh, whoa.
What?
-What? What? -Oh, boy.
What's happening?
-You… You look weird. -You look weird.
-No, you look weird. -You-- No, you.
-No, you! You! -You! You! Him!
I don't need these clothes anymore!
I'm sure this will pass. It's fine!
Fine? Are you kidding me?
This is incredible! [grunts]
Hi, Dora!
Hi there, Map! Oh, I thought I lost you.
You can never lose me. I'm always with you!
-Hi, Dora. -[gasps]
Backpack!
My mouth is a zipper!
-Hi, Dora. -Hmm.
-I don't know you, small rock. -Oh.
-But it's nice to make your acquaintance. -Ah.
Everyone is here!
-[all cheering] -Whoo-hoo!
Look! Papi's journal!
Wait!
-[grunts] -You okay, Dora?
I can't. I'm not ready.
Take my hand. Let's try this together.
Yay!
[Dora] Sammy! Randy!
[both] We've got you, Dora.
Thanks, guys!
-[Randy] What do we do? -[Sammy] Oh, we should sing her a song.
She likes songs.
♪ Please be alive, Dora, don't be dead ♪
♪ That sounds like something That you would have said ♪
-Oh, I'm not very good at this. -[Randy] It worked!
She's waking up.
Hey!
-Randy? -Oh, thank goodness.
-[Boots grunts softly] -Boots!
Sammy!
-Hi. -You came back.
-You have a nice voice. -[Sammy] Well…
sometimes a song's the best idea.
But not often. Oh, and don't tell anyone I did that.
You're going to be okay.
You know, Dora, I…
I never forgot about the jungle.
And you…
you were my best friend…
and my-- my first friend.
I'm glad I'm here with you, Dora.
I mean, this…
this is our next adventure, prima.
Our next adventure, primo.
I-- I had the weirdest dream.
The entrance to Parapata should be somewhere in these mountains.
Oh, that's great. For the first time,
I'm actually feeling really good about how things are--
[Randy] Ignore what I just said.
[Diego] Whoa.
This was all hidden down here?
[sighs] Well, great. Now we're stuck in a hole.
[Diego] Wow.
Stars.
[both] It's a star map.
Classic us.
But the stars aren't in the correct place.
Awesome.
It's a jungle puzzle! [laughs]
I don't think this is a jungle puzzle.
Mainly because there's no such thing as a jungle puzzle.
Listen, I've seen several movies about the jungle.
To solve this, we have to get the stars in the right place.
And when we do, these big stone wheels will turn and the treasure will be revealed. [chuckles] It's gonna be awesome.
and the treasure will be revealed. [chuckles] It's gonna be awesome.
I just need to figure out how to move the first piece.
Oh.
Are you sure you should be touching that?
-[Diego] What is that? -[rattling]
That does not sound like a good noise.
Oh, wait. The stars are in the right position.
It's the southern hemisphere.
-I was just looking at it the wrong way. -It's still a jungle puzzle, right?
Oh! Oh! I don't think this is a jungle puzzle.
-This is a puquio. -[Sammy] What the flip is a puquio?
It's an ancient underground aqueduct.
Inca engineers built some of the most elaborate irrigation systems ever devised.
-Water, from above, using gravity. -[ratcheting]
-Oh, oh! -Stop pulling levers, Randy! [screams]
Ah! I'm trying to find the off switch!
Okay, if this is an aqueduct, we just need to somehow open the sluice gate.
How do you know so much about aqueducts?
We learned about them last year in history class.
You were there. It was the week you wore a lot of red and pink.
I look at you a lot, okay?
We need to find the sluice gate. Where is the sluice gate?
Please stop saying "sluice gate."
That must be the mechanism that controls the sluice gate.
That's what it's called, okay? We have bigger thing to deal with right now!
Everyone give me a hand. It's gonna take all of us.
-One, two, three! -[all inhale]
This is our last chance. It's now or never.
-[gasps] -Who here can hold their breath for seven minutes?
It's hard to tell with all of this water,
but I'm assuming none of your hands are raised.
This one's mine. [inhales]
Dora!
-Dora! -[Cole] What?
-[Elena] Oh, honey. Oh, honey! -[Cole] Dora!
-Mami! -Oh!
-My baby girl. -[Cole] Honey! Honey!
Hey! Oh!
Randy did it! We're alive!
-Tía, tío. -Okay,
can somebody please tell me what's going on?
We were kidnapped by mercenaries who were after Parapata.
Oh, I did something epic! I'm basically a superhero!
Oh!
Hi, Dora's parents.
Okay, honey, who are all these people?
We're Dora's friends. From school.
It's fine. Fine.
We're on a field trip.
And where are the mercenaries?
Alejandro saved us from them. And he's with us!
-Who? -Your old friend.
-Alejandro, from the university. -You-- You sent him your journal.
My journal was stolen days before the expedition.
-[radio beeps] -Bravo team…
this is Alpha leader.
You don't know him, do you?
Oh. Miércoles.
-We found them. -[Elena] Honey, come here.
-Get back, kids. -Delta rendezvous point.
You have my location.
-You lied to me. -No, no, no, no, no.
-No, I outwitted you… -That's the same thing.
…as I have outwitted every adversary that came before you.
-[gasps] -Hey!
Who would have believed that my greatest achievement,
the final act in a prosperous treasure-hunting career
would find me squaring off against a socially inept jungle nerd…
-Hey, hey, hey! -…and three high school losers.
I don't know them, so whatever.
-[exhales] -Now, if you please…
you will lead me to Parapata.
But you can't get inside. It's impenetrable.
-"Impenetrable!" -That means you can't get inside.
-I know! -Okay.
Shut up!
You wouldn't want anything to happen to her…
now, would you?
-Of course not. -Good.
Good, good.
So, if everyone just plays nice, I'll get my gold,
and you'll be on your way home safe and sound.
[scoffs] You're a smart family, right?
So, make the smart choice. Hmm?
[Alejandro] We're moving out! Let's go!
I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.
If we do what he says, we'll be okay.
[Dora] Sorry, I'm so sorry.
[both] No, we're sorry.
-We love you so much! -[Elena] It's our fault.
Can you all shut up back there?
I've had to listen to your mindless positivity for three days!
Your relentless good-natured spirit is a holy nightmare!
So just shut up! Shut up!
-I'm so sorry about that. -Yeah-- Shut up!
No more talking.
And definitely no more singing.
Why have you stopped here?
This is it, isn't it?
-[Elena] No, no, no. It, uh-- -No, no, no.
-Hey, wait. -No, please, wait!
Wow.
Parapata.
[Diego] It's real!
[Alejandro] We make camp tonight by those gates.
[claps] Come on. ¡Órale!
No, Boots, quit it! No!
Papi wants us to do what they say.
-What's going on back here? -[thud]
-Oops. -Kids! -[Randy squeals] -[Dora] Run!
Wow, it really is the deadliest weapon.
[Powell] Viper! What's going on back there?
Put that down.
What happened?
Viper got yo-yoed.
-Again? -Again.
Take the professors to the gate.
I spent days with these brats.
I know what they'll do next.
Diego! Sammy!
Randy! Where are you guys? [screams]
[Dora] Boots!
You shouldn't have done that!
So what if he's a double-crossing mercenary treasure hunter?
My parents are gonna show him the treasure and he's gonna let us all go.
He's gonna kill them… isn't he?
He's gonna kill all of us.
Oh, no.
I can't save them.
Not by myself.
I'm just a kid. [sighs]
You're not a kid.
But you're not a grownup either, Dora.
You're a teenager. It's a super confusing time.
But the fact is, you're right, you can't do it by yourself.
Good news is you have friends now.
And together, anything is possible.
Boots, you can talk?
Boots. Hey, Boots. Boots, come on. Boots.
-Hey, did you guys hear that? -Uh. You talking to a monkey?
-[Boots squeals] -No, no, Boots was talking to me.
Maybe she hit her head. [chuckles]
Come on, guys, we have to save my parents.
How? We are teenagers armed with yo-yos.
All Alejandro wants is the gold.
And if we can get inside Parapata, we can trade the treasure for my parents.
But how are we going to get into Parapata? We're gonna figure it out. Together.
Tonight.
♪ Guarding the gate I'm guarding the gate ♪
♪ Swiper is guarding the gate ♪
♪ Guarding the gate I'm guarding the gate ♪
Would you stop singing? It's unprofessional.
How are we gonna get past him?
♪ Guarding the gate I'm guarding the gate ♪
Whatcha got there? [gasps]
It's just a little frog.
Oh. Oh, man…
Good job, golden poison frog.
There must be a way to open the gates from the outside.
[Sammy] Hey, guys, look at these.
Each one has a lever.
I was wrong about jungle puzzles, okay?
There is no such thing as a jungle puzzle.
Wait, don't do that! Look. Traps.
Could be arrows, or poison.
It looks like there's traps everywhere.
This is one heavy security system.
So, how do we know which levers to pull? There are so many combinations.
What the--
Guys, look down.
[Randy and Dora] Looks like constellations.
Classic us. Again.
[Dora] This is Yawar Mayu, the Inca night sky.
Ah. Look. Some of the stones retain the light longer.
This is anka, the eagle.
Look.
And that's atuq, the fox.
That's… right there.
This one looks like a serpent.
-[Sammy] Are there any more? -[Diego] This one's otorongo, the jaguar.
This must be the fourth lever.
Okay, but… which one should we pull first?
Maybe we pull 'em all at once?
Well, that's a pretty big "maybe."
At least if we die, we all get to die together, right?
On three, we pull.
Ready?
One…
two…
three.
Okay. It's official. Movies lie.
[Randy] It's a jungle puzzle.
It's a real freaking jungle puzzle.
That is so awesome! I'm sorry I doubted you, movies.
[Dora] I've never seen anything like it.
This is the discovery of a lifetime! [chuckles]
[Diego] I guess this must be the temple.
The gold, right?
This is totally where the gold's hidden.
Everything the Inca treasured will be in here.
But remember we're explorers, not treasure hunters.
We're not treasure hunters, but Alejandro sure is.
So let's be quick.
-[grunting] -Come on. I don't do last.
It's empty.
I don't get it.
[Diego] I don't see any doors.
This can't be all that there is.
[Randy] I don't see any treasure.
[Diego] It was probably cleaned out by Spanish conquistadores.
-Or the British. -Or the French.
Or the Americans and the United Fruit Company.
I found this bowl. Could be treasure.
-That's a sun bowl. -[Boots squeals]
[Sammy] You tilt the bowls to reflect the sunlight.
So that must mean there's…
Look! There's an opening in the wall for the sun to shine in.
[Dora] Well, this flashlight can be our sun. Here, Boots.
-[Dora] Huh. -Now what?
We have to angle the bowl to the right place in the room.
-[Dora] Clearly, they loved geometry. -[Sammy] They fit together symmetrically.
[both] The golden ratio! 51 degrees.
Okay, Randy, angle your bowl 51 degrees to Diego.
Okay. [chuckles]
Okay, Diego to me.
[Randy] Yeah.
Okay.
Now, I'll turn mine 51 degrees and we'll see where it lands.
[gasps] A door! It's opening a door, guys.
Just hold the beam until the doors are fully open.
What is that? Some sort of Ancient Inca group hug?
It slipped. I'm sorry.
-Oh, guys. You might want to look up. -Huh?
The jungle puzzles are turning on us!
-The door's closing! -Everyone run!
-Come on, Boots! -[Boots screams]
Dora, Dora! Try and pull it open.
-It isn't enough! -[Boots grunting]
-[Dora strains] -[ratcheting]
Thank you! Thank you!
Oh, Boots. [laughs] Good job, buddy!
Whoa. That's some hallway.
[Diego] It's like it goes on forever.
-At the end, is that-- -A giant golden monkey? [laughs]
[Randy] We did it, guys. We found the treasure.
Wait, these skulls, they look like a--
-…warning. -[loud groaning]
Oh, come on!
[gasps] Spears!
Okay! Okay, I know what we have to do.
When we get to the bottom of the hallway, we have to jump at the same time.
-It's too far! -What? We will never make it!
No, it's an illusion, okay? Trust me.
-[breathes heavily] -It's okay, Sammy. Just let go. It's okay.
Okay.
Three, two, one. Go!
Now! Jump!
It was a forced perspective. A trick to fool thieves and trespassers!
-Good job, Diego. -Ancient Inca group hug for the win, guys.
[Randy] The monkey looked a lot more impressive back there.
Looks pretty impressive to me.
-Is that an emerald? -[Sammy] It's bigger than a basketball!
I think we found the treasure, guys.
No.
This is the last puzzle.
Look.
This is a quipu.
Inca written language.
"Make an offering to the Gods…
of that which is most revered."
What did the Inca revere the most?
[Alejandro] That's easy!
The same as me.
Gold.
Oh, crud.
Thanks for getting through the tough stuff for me.
Once again, I only had to follow Miss Know-It-All,
and she led me straight to the gold. [laughs]
Gold. Gold! [laughs]
Lots and lots of gold!
The answer to the puzzle is obvious.
The Incas built monuments to their gods with it.
Gold is as close to touching the sun as the Incas could get.
It's happening! [laughs] It's happening!
It's happening! [laughs]
I beat you! I won!
I beat you, I won! I beat you, I won! Ha!
The treasure is going to be mine!
You were wrong about me, Alejandro.
I'm not a know-it-all.
But by now, I do know you.
I knew that you would follow us in here.
And I knew that you would let us take all the risk for you.
I knew the final Inca test would carry
I knew the final Inca test would carry dire consequences for those who should fail it.
Which is why we are over here, and you…
Well, you're standing right there.
[Alejandro] I'm still alive!
[radio chirps] Powell! Viper!
Help me! Get in here! Now!
My mercenaries are on their way.
This isn't over yet!
-Dora! -Oh, honey!
-Mami! Papi! I'm so sorry. -[grunting]
It's fine. How cool is this?
Look at these guys, that's a real crossbow.
Honey. That's a real crossbow, yep.
It's the Lost Guardians of Parapata.
Ridiculous! There are no lost guardians. I made them up.
No, they're super real, bro.
I think this is when we perish.
-[speaking Quechua] -Dora!
-Be strong, honey, okay? -You choose the right thing.
-[shushes] -Yep.
-[both sigh] -She did it.
-Thank you. Yeah. -Thank you.
Honey.
[gasps] It's like nothing I've…
-ever imagined. -Ever imagined.
It's breathtaking.
Monkey.
Really big gold monkey. [laughs]
-[rumbling] -[Boots gasps] [Swiper] Say goodbye to your little friend.
What is happening?
-Swiper! -Adiós, losers!
Everyone get out of here!
-What about the gold? -It doesn't matter!
Wait, guys! What about me?
You can't leave me here!
Dora! Randy! Help me!
We're a team! Guys!
[Sammy] Dora, come on!
[Alejandro] I knew the answer was water!
Can you give me another go?
I was joking about the gold! Of course not gold!
Water is precious!
Honey, let's go!
And you'll never find it now, man!
We gotta go! I love Parapata, but I don't want to be stuck here forever.
Uh-oh.
-Boots! -[Swiper] Get off me, monkey!
-Ow! [grunts] -[Boots chuckles]
Oh, man. The indignity!
That's it.
-[Elena] Dora, no! -[Cole] Dora, wait!
[Elena] What are you doing?
-Oh, wow. -[gasps]
[Elena] Dora! You did it!
Should we put up a sign saying, "Choose the water"?
-[laughter] -No? Okay.
Dora…
Hey.
Look, I know we weren't exactly friends when this trip started, but I--
I like you, too.
-Dora's staring at us again, isn't she? -Yeah.
Okay.
Mom, Dad!
We have some exciting news.
We're going back into the jungle in a few weeks.
We'll be gone for a few months, no contact, -just us against the elements. -Mm-hmm.
Me and your mom.
And you.
We're onto something big, Dora.
About that.
[Randy] Someone pulled a lever, not sure who, but--
-You. You! -[Diego] You know who it was.
I think…
I think I want to go back to the city.
I know the jungle pretty well.
-Okay. -But, um, high school…
I think I need more time to study that culture.
And its indigenous people.
-Right. Yeah, sure. -Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.
-That's good. -I love you guys.
-We love you, too. -We love you, sweetheart.
-[both sobbing] -Oh, God, what is happening?
-She has a life of her own now. -I'm so happy for her.
I'm so happy.
It's gonna be okay, babe. It's gonna be okay.
It's not gonna be okay!
[Cole continues sobbing] But I'm so happy for her.
Hey, look. The Dork-as multiplied.

-Jojo! -And Paula!
-Yippee! -Jojo! Hurry!
-I'm faster than you. -Yeah.
You have to pull harder!
I'm not into that.
Sorry, I'm not into that.
Okay.
No problem.
Like that better?
Can't think of anything more exciting?
-Oh God. -Are you out of your mind?
Are you crazy?
-How long have you been there? -Long enough to see how boring you are.
Cool. Okay.
No, dude. You can go now.
You sure?
-Yeah, shut up. -Come on.
No, come on, I want you to myself now.
Time for you to go.
You might think what you're doing here is cool,
but it's not cool at all.
-Cool hipster single life you have there. -Thank you, sir.
Oh man!
Was that necessary?
Don't be so melodramatic.
Should I get him back?
No.
Jojo, can't you stay here, please?
I need you here.
Remember, we are forever.
I'm going to miss you so much.
-Come on, Pauli! -Yeah.
-Paula! -I'm just getting my suitcase.
Come on, Paula!
Paula, come on.
-Hey! -Sorry. I didn't mean to.
Stop it!
It's the computer, not me.
Go over there!
Hey, look.
Yeah, sure.
It's Daniel.
-Stop it. I can't figure this out. -Dude, that's him.
Who?
The guy from back home.
You're right!
That's crazy.
-He doesn't look so bad now. -Well, yes, he does.
Hi. What are you two doing here? Where are you off to?
-To Tulum, but just me. So… -Me too. I'm flying to Tulum.
-For real? -What are you doing in Mexico?
Sorry Daniel, it's nice to see you but we were just saying bye.
I'll be working.
What kind of work?
Nothing special. Just as a tour operator.
-That's awesome. -And you?
I'll be surfing.
Maybe you could join me.
No, we have a "no surfer dudes" rule.
Yeah, but who cares? I might join you anyway.
Good.
What are you up to?
Like for work?
Yeah.
Funny that people always ask about work first.
Super funny.
The Brits always talk about the weather.
Do you realize how dumb this conversation is?
-Shit. -Shit, we have to go.
I can help you.
-No, I got it. Thanks. -Bye, Pauli.
No, I'm coming.
The flight departs at 4:55 p.m.
Wait.
I love you.
I love you more.
-Ciao. -Bye.
Bye-bye.
Tell me.
I'm about to go surfing.
-With that guy? -Yeah.
He just happened to have the seat next to mine.
Cool.
We chatted the whole time.
His father died. Do you remember him?
Yeah, crazy.
Your parents are both dead. You must be soulmates.
You're such an asshole.
-Where does your surfer boy live now? -He still lives there.
No! He's still in Shitsville?
I knew it! He looks exactly like he's from there.
He inherited the farm from his dad. But he just sold it because it was too much for him.
But he just sold it because it was too much for him.
Interesting.
So, changing the subject…
About the rent…
No, Paula. No. You haven't taken care of it--
I have. In theory, I've taken care of it.
No, you haven't.
Yes, I have.
But could you cover it for one more month?
-I'll sort it out then. -How?
Hello, job center.
NUMBER - ROOM TICKETS
I'm tickling you.
Ms. Peska, you do know why we canceled your payments?
Because you're assholes?
Because you repeatedly failed to apply for jobs.
They were shitty jobs.
No, they weren't.
What are you living on now?
I'm living off my best friend.
And the job center is kind of like your best friend?
You studied law for six years for nothing.
Just to bomb the bar exam.
I can understand that you aren't super motivated.
I probably wouldn't be either.
But that doesn't help.
I don't know what to do either.
Come to my place tonight?
-I'm sorry? -You have a girlfriend?
You can bring her too.
How about some continuing education? Here's a JavaScript course.
Here are two jobs.
Take a look at them and apply there.
Cleaner?
The other one's at a bowling alley.
As a janitor.
BOWLING & LASER TAG FUN & EVENT CENTER - DARTS
Jojo, could you pick up when I call? I miss you.
You can shove these voicemails up your ass!
I want to see your face, dude. Fuck you!
I miss you.
What?
Can you hear me?
Hello?
I miss you!
-Pauli! -What are you doing?
Jojo?
Jojo?
I can't hear you…
I can't really hear you. Can you…
No worries. We'll talk later.
We should talk a bit later, okay?
Jojo, hi.
Pauli.
I'm coming back.
What, really?
-Can you pick me up at the airport? -But…
-Bu-- -I just quit my job.
Is everything okay?
I can tell you… I'll tell you when I'm back, okay?
-I'll send you my flight details. -Tell me real quick.
See you.
Pauli!
Pauli!
WELCOME HOME FROM PRISON
I feel sick. I'm going to puke on the wall.
I missed you.
Hi.
Hi.
Can we drop you off somewhere?
No, I'm coming with you.
So what happened? Why are you back?
Everything's so ugly here, isn't it?
-Have you ever noticed? -No.
Dude!
What's wrong?
Tell me what's going on.
Come on, keep driving.
No.
What happened?
Did your boss harass you?
I can't tell you.
Why not?
You have cancer.
No. Come on, let's go get a beer.
I don't want a beer.
-But you always want beer. -But not right now.
That's a sign that something's off.
Tell me now. If you say you're pregnant, I'll jump off the bridge.
Please keep driving.
I don't give a shit. I'm staying here.
Keep driving.
I can't tell you. No way. Paula!
Stop it now!
-Tell me what's wrong. -No.
-Will you stop then? -Yes.
-Get in first. -Okay.
Then I'll tell you. Paula, are you crazy?
Get in. Stop all this shit!
We're getting married.
What?
Daniel and I are getting married.
-So you are pregnant? -No.
-Then why marry him? -Because he's great.
He's an island boy.
-No, he's not. -Does he have a Barbour jacket?
Yes, but as a joke.
Paula, get to know him.
You get to know him, dude.
Do you have to marry him so soon?
Yeah, because I want to. Because it feels right.
And that's not everything.
You are pregnant.
Oh God. I know what it is.
You're moving in with him.
Back to Shitsville.
I want to be with him, and he doesn't want to leave.
And what about us?
…when it comes to feelings
Once the ball begins to roll Sometimes it's too late
How often was I sure That I would win tonight
And the next morning My life starts once again
Yet fate is not for sale And how often have I lost
That won't happen to me again I promised myself then
With you it was different From the very start
You are the rock I can hold onto
Now I love you more than ever
With my heart and soul
Feelings are only real if you forget No matter what happened
I didn't want a million ingredients.
That wasn't the reason.
…millions killed, dude.
Do you hear me…
That hurt.
Paula.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Close your eyes.
Okay.
You're not going to hit me, right?
We'll see.
You can open them now.
Welcome home!
Thank you.
Make a wish.
Out loud or to myself?
I guess it depends.
Pauli.
Do it now or the candle will go out.
I wish to have both of you.
Then I hope it comes true.
I'm not letting you get married.
So, what do you want to drink? I have beer and liquor.
I'm afraid I had no money left for wine.
Listen, Daniel is exhausted.
He couldn't sleep at all on the plane.
He can do that now.
Sorry, but I'm tired too.
I'll take a rain check, okay?
Yeah. Of course.
Jet lag and all that.
Thanks.
Sorry I didn't tell you earlier.
It's okay.
And I know this is all really crazy.
But Pauli, I'm so madly in love with him.
I can't handle it.
I've never felt anything like this before. It's different.
Everything feels right. I know I want this so bad.
I know exactly what I want. I want him.
It's like I've always known him. I don't want anything else.
I know exactly… It's like being in a tunnel.
I can't see left or right.
I'm just in a tunnel, a super awesome tunnel.
And I can't handle it. I can't see what's around me.
It's like…
It's like how it was with your law degree.
You did it and you knew it was all you wanted, and…
Shit. That was shit. I am shit.
-Paula, you want something too? -No.
-Just try some. -No.
-Here you go. -No.
I don't like pancakes. They're too thick.
Okay, then.
I'll help you in a bit.
You're so gross.
You're not really doing this.
You're not doing this.
Pauli.
Can't you just be happy for me?
Okay.
But then I'm coming too.
And what'll you do there? Visit your mother?
Or what?
I'll think of something.
I'm sure we still know a few people there I call.
Yeah?
I can't think of anyone.
No, but you can still count on me coming with you.
I'd like to do this on my own.
No.
You think that little backpack will do?
Yes.
I'll give you two days.
Ah okay.
Well, maybe until the weekend.
Okay, then.
I have to pee.
-Sorry, I need to go. -She needs to go.
He heard what I said.
She needs to pee.
-Are you ready? -I just saw it.
I'm getting scared.
Did you change your mind?
-You? -I'll show you everything, okay?
Okay.
-Well, you're here now. -Yeah.
Fuck, we're really doing this.
-Tell me, what do you think? -Yeah.
-Yeah! -Yeah!
So, this is our garden.
-Yeah. And this? -That's the door.
-Our little home. -Yes, it is.
Our window on the left and the right.
Yeah, no problem.
I'll bring it all in, motherfuckers.
Leave that up front…
-Yeah, you can't see it from there. -But here…
Yeah, I know.
-Did you paint that? -I painted it all myself.
What will you do with these things?
Bring them to my other fiancée?
Don't throw it all away.
I'll make some space.
Then it will fit.
And here? Is this… I see.
-Is this… -This is the bathroom.
-You can spend all your time in here. -I believe you.
I carved it myself.
This has to… Wait.
Okay. If you look out here…
Look up there! Look at that! What is it?
That's how it's supposed to look. Don't worry. I'll toss it.
-But it's pretty if you look out there. -Yeah.
Jojo.
Jojo.
What are you doing?
But…
-Is there enough left? -Yeah.
-In both. -In both.
We're going out to eat later. Want to come?
Janosch is coming too.
I don't know him.
Come on.
No. I've suppressed all my memories of this horrible island.
He wanted to play matchmaker, but I said it was a shitty idea.
Look, I used to cross the dunes there.
-Wow. -And there was a beach back there.
-That's why you don't have to look. -Right.
I'd rather look at you.
I don't know anyone who still has CDs.
Me neither.
Look, there's Janosch.
-Hey. -Hey, what's up?
Daniel at the wheel, tires will squeal!
-Hey. -Hey.
You still remember my cousin, right?
No.
Go left. There was a traffic jam earlier.
All right, Mr. Navigator.
Mr. Navigator.
And what about you?
Yeah, pretty good so far.
-Got everything done? -Yeah.
And you? Are you excited?
-No. -A bit.
Are you guys happy?
Are we happy?
-Are we ever! -Careful. Shit.
Okay, we've seen everything. We can go home.
A guy for you. Now shut up.
A guy for you. Now shut up. Yuck. Ugly.
How beautiful is that!
Can you pass me the olives? Pass me the olives.
Here. Dip. Here.
Want some too?
These are super yummy.
Do you want cutlery? Or are you eating with your fingers?
Can you give me some bread, please?
Oh God! Are we really doing this?
-Well, we can always leave. -No.
No way.
Hey, have you had these? So good.
That's the last thing I'd try.
-Okay. What about you? -Sure, bro.
I can depend on you.
It's Dani's ex.
Hi.
I saw your car.
Hi.
I had no idea you were back.
Yeah,
for a few days now.
Hi.
Have a seat.
No thanks. Dani, I'll go.
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
Ellin…
I'm sorry.
Awkward.
No, she wasn't awkward at all.
I haven't tried that yet.
I thought she looked really sad.
-How are things with you, Paula? -What?
Yeah, what do you do?
This, that, baseball bat.
And what does that mean?
-You know, just stuff. -No, tell us.
I…
Go on.
Ever heard of boundaries?
-Yeah. -Come on, he's just interested in you.
Paula doesn't do anything.
Hey!
What?
You started a degree, flunked the exam and then nada.
Dude, Johanna?
That's how it is. It's okay to admit that you can't handle it.
Well,
when I think about it, we did some fun things.
We once made a bet to see if for one year,
we could hook up with a different person each week.
-Paula. -Meaning, 52 weeks…
Fifty-two…
Fifty-two men.
Fifty-two people, you heteronormative island bro.
In one year, you screwed 52 people?
-No, we didn't. -Yes, we did. Yes.
-It wasn't like that. -Yes, it was.
-And? What was it like? -Great.
-It was really great. -No.
Yes, it was.
And what kind of people were they?
Good ones.
Good people. Do you want to know who won the bet?
-No. -I don't know.
Of course.
Do you realize how awkward you are?
My phone's ringing.
Paula?
Paula?
Paula!
On the phone.
No, that's my trick.
What do you want?
Hey, are you out of your mind?
Why do you have to bring up that shit?
It was a great bet.
We had a lot of fun, remember?
Twenty years ago.
-Two. -Paula?
What about his ex?
Who is his ex?
-Hey, you're not stupid. -What do you mean?
You saw. There's still something going on.
Why are you doing this?
-What? -Ruining it for me.
Excuse me?
-How can I go back there? -The same way you came out.
Forget it.
This is getting really pathetic.
Can you just go now?
Yeah.
GERRY'S GRILL CAFÉ HARBOR KIOSK
-Dude, you scared me. -What are you doing here?
Did you sleep here?
Are those my clothes?
-I'll be gone soon. -Where are you going?
-You got big! -Children grow up. The miracle of life.
When did you become cool?
So can I visit you now too?
Sure. You can visit me anytime.
I just had a lot to do.
Of course.
When is Jojo's wedding?
-It won't happen. -Why not?
She's gone mad.
And because it's all nonsense.
But isn't she your best friend?
I bet you this wedding won't happen.
I don't get it.
Yes, because your brain isn't fully developed yet.
It's okay. It might still happen.
Don't you have a boyfriend or a hobby or something?
Here's my boyfriend.
You're so dumb.
-I have to go now. -I'll take you.
No.
-Why not? -Because I'm going with that guy.
-With that guy? -Yeah, with him.
Nice guy.
Yeah.
Hey.
-Hi. -Hey.
-So, who are you? -Jeremy. Hi.
This is my sister. She was just about to leave.
Yeah.
Basti has told me a lot about you.
-Really? -That's not true.
But she believed it.
-Well… -We have to go.
Salut, sister.
I mentioned it before.
No need to talk about it now. I asked you a clear question too.
Why won't you answer? Just leave those things alone.
Why are you trying to dodge this?
But that's what happened.
So don't say that it didn't.
I was sitting beside you!
What are you doing here?
I just wanted to get my things.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Everything's great.
What's he doing?
Going to work.
What kind of work?
Not totally sure.
Do you two ever talk or do you just fuck?
At the moment, we just fuck.
Sorry about yesterday.
You know I really am going to do this.
What?
Get married.
No.
I don't think you'll marry him.
What about that fight earlier?
People fight sometimes.
Paula, for real.
What will you do?
After the wedding.
Fuck the wedding photographer.
No, I mean after that.
You alone in the apartment without me.
What am I supposed to do?
Exactly, I don't know.
Just get married first.
Then we'll see.
Okay, I have an idea.
Let's go get you a wedding dress.
Really?
Yeah.
-Are you serious? -Yes, of course.
If you think about it any longer, I'll change my mind.
Hello.
Hi.
How cute.
Let me see.
You're such an idiot.
-Look, this is the one. -That's the one.
-Cheesy as hell. -Nice and simple.
With these glasses.
That's how I'd get married.
Hey, babe.
Oh God.
-This one? -Nice.
I'll try it on.
I'm coming!
-Well? -Stunning.
Please marry me, Jojo. I mean it.
Hello.
Paula, come here.
Paula!
Paula.
-Did you know? -No.
-I can tell by your face. -I really didn't.
Paula?
I really didn't.
-Let's get out. -Yes.
-Help me get out of this. -I will.
-The back is sewn up. -Here, wait.
I'll help you.
Thanks.
Stop.
What is this? Are you kidding me?
It was already like that.
Wait, you're the…
Hi.
What are you doing here?
-Nothing. We were just leaving. -Right.
You have to pay for this.
Well, I'm afraid we didn't do that, so…
I'm not stupid.
Cash?
Credit card?
You're perfect for him.
Two inconsiderate assholes have found each other.
Thanks for shopping here.
Have a nice day.
Why did you take me there?
What do you mean?
Paula, stop bullshitting me. You've been acting really strange.
No.
What she said earlier was strange.
It doesn't matter now.
I'm going home.
We were gonna get a drink.
I'm done for today. Can I drop you somewhere?
Jojo, dude, come on.
I'm sorry. Can't we talk about it?
No thanks.
Can't you just stay with me for once?
I just told you I'm going home.
Why are you so mad all of a sudden?
Wait a minute.
No, stay here. Jojo!
-Please get out. -Jojo!
Don't be so mad.
Hey, you two.
The kiosk is the only good thing on this shitty island.
So, what happened?
To make you hate it so much.
Okay, I get it.
And you?
Why do you like it so much?
I don't know. It's just home, I guess.
Jojo is my home.
This is my uncle.
My grandpa and uncle were the first surfers on the island.
Seriously?
-Paula. -Hey.
-Paula, want a beer? -Yeah.
He's still arguing with a guy in France who claims he was the first.
He's still arguing with a guy in France who claims he was the first. But he wasn't.
My grandpa was already surfing in 1952.
On the news, he saw people surfing on boards in Hawaii.
Something only royalty was allowed to do back then.
He was a lifeguard,
so he got hold of a board and just went surfing.
Do you like surfing?
Honestly?
Yeah.
I think it's dumb.
How can you think it's stupid?
I'm scared of the sea.
You're from here.
The sea is all around us.
Why are you scared of it?
I don't know.
You're funny.
How would you know?
No idea. Are you not?
How do you know what somone's like when you don’t know them?
Intuition?
-I think I'd better go back in. -Now?
Yeah.
Can I sleep over tonight?
I don't think so.
Why not?
I don't know.
Okay.
Take care.
Basti?
You again.
What time is it?
Almost two.
I could sleep all the time.
Yes, another form of denial.
-You look like shit too. -Who was that guy the other day?
That's none of your business.
Are you in love or something?
He's just an exchange student.
He'll be gone soon. I won't let my heart get broken.
And you?
I heard you have something with Janosch.
No.
I won't let my heart get broken either.
So are we both extra smart or extra dumb?
Come here.
What are you doing here?
I was looking for you.
In front of his ex's store? Cut the shit.
We had a fight.
Who?
The pope and I. Come on, Paula.
Why?
I asked him about Ellin, and then
he got all weird, so I thought
I'd go ask her.
Ask her?
I feel like shit.
-I think that's a good idea. -No, it's a shitty idea.
Feels like I cheated on him, and I didn't even talk to her.
What's really going on?
I don't know.
Tell me.
I have no idea.
It all just changed once we got here.
So serious now.
Do you want to visit your mom?
Yeah.
We were lucky that she hit a rock.
Just imagine all that hassle with a bib
and cleaning up the drool and all that shit.
Well done, Ulrike!
Well done,
Mom!
She jumped because she saw no other way out of her marriage.
You know that, right?
Oh Pauli.
It's not that simple.
It's not?
I know exactly what I want.
Why are you crying, then?
Because we had a fight. It's no big deal.
Who are you trying to fool?
Can you only be happy when I feel like shit?
Jojo, you know it's not about that.
I just want you to realize how shitty it is here.
Well done, Jojo!
Jojo!
Jojo!
Jojo?
Jojo!
Jojo!
I'll be off, then.
Okay.
So, was that it?
What do you mean?
No idea. I don't know what I mean either.
I'm sure you do this all the time in Berlin, right?
Yeah.
I suppose so, yeah.
Don't you want to come to bed?
Sorry.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to apologize.
You paid for the dress. It's okay.
Yes, but I'm sorry about how we behaved.
Theoretically, we're actually still together.
What?
Attack!
Attack!
Paula.
Attack!
-Paula, I feel like shit right now. -Retreat.
Retreat.
Retreat!
Ellin, what are you doing here?
Hey, yo.
Hey. Have you been drinking?
Just an aperitif. A small one.
Can we come in?
-Can I come in too? -Please do, madam. Come right in. Jojo!
Paula! Hey, we have so much to eat.
Janosch also brought two cases of wine.
-Come here, I'll show you the fish. -We need to talk.
I… Wait a second, I just have to…
-What is it? -I brought someone with me.
I see. That's cool. Who is it?
Well, you might hate me now
but that's okay because you might not hate me one day.
What are you talking about?
Dani?
Paula.
Yes.
What are you doing here?
I just told you I brought her.
Right.
Yeah, do you want a drink?
-No. -Yes, please.
White wine?
Paula? Can we go outside for a minute?
Yeah, but now's not a great time. We have a guest. It'd be rude.
Yeah.
Hi, I'm Jojo.
Do you want a drink?
-No thanks. -She does.
Just give her a glass.
No, I'll do it.
Here you go.
-It's okay. I'll get something. -No, just leave it there.
It's not a problem. Just tell me where the bucket is--
Are you his maid?
-Just leave it. -It's no problem.
It's okay. Just tell me where it is.
Under the sink next to the trash!
It's okay. I'll get it.
Ellin, please just stay…
Paula, can you please tell me exactly why you brought her here?
Johanna, just chill for five seconds!
Jojo, I think I need to talk to you.
-Talk to me? Yeah? -Yeah.
Right.
That was so obvious. Can you shut up?
What is it?
It…
No, Ellin, leave it.
Come on Ellin, I'll do it.
-I'll do it. -I can do it too. I just said…
-No, let me. -I'm doing it!
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Well, then…
Let's all just sit down, then.
Ellin, where do you want to sit?
Daniel, what's going on here?
I'm sorry. I wanted to talk to you, but… not now.
Huh? What's going on here?
What exactly are you sorry about?
That she's still your girlfriend?
What? That's not true.
-So when did you break up with me? -I said I needed some space.
When you two met, he was still with me.
And when you decided to get married, he was still with me then too.
And when you--
If you go to fucking Mexico and say that you need space,
If you go to fucking Mexico and say that you need space, then the message is pretty clear.
No.
You kept writing to me.
Is that true?
Yeah, because I… because…
you're important to me.
Okay.
That's interesting now, too…
And because I was worried about you. You understand?
I want you to be okay. I don't want to hurt you.
What the hell is this shit?
This isn't doing any good, huh?
I was going to tell you.
When?
When? After this absurd wedding?
I don't get why you're so mad. It has nothing to do with you.
Are you stupid?
You have no right to interfere. None at all.
I'm not interfering.
I'm protecting her from fuckers like you!
What's your fucking problem?
Leave her alone!
No.
Hey!
What the hell is this?
Your relationship was based on a pile of shit.
-And I feel really sorry for Ellin. -Say what?
I think you should be thanking me.
Why show me up like that? In front of everyone.
It was the only way you'd listen.
This guy is an asshole.
Get that through your head! He doesn't need you.
But I need you.
Whoa, Paula, you're out of your mind. Do you even realize?
You're a psycho, Paula.
A mess.
You're a completely deranged lunatic.
Do you enjoy dragging others into your shit?
Do you get a kick out of that?
What do you actually want? What are you doing here?
Get a grip on your life, and let me live mine!
Stop interfering all the time, damn it!
Yes.
Right, Horst Heiner?
What are quads again?

You stole a cop car.
Six years. Seven schools.

That's gotta be a record, and not one to be proud of.
[chuckling] It's hard not to see it as an accomplishment.
I'm glad you think it's funny.
This time it's serious, Will.
That leaves me no choice but to remand you to a state facility.
Juvie?
Mark, come on, you can't be serious.
-You've been through a lot. -I'll do better.
You're smart.
-Talented. -Hey, I'll change.

I'm sorry, Will. That group home was the last option.
I know it's been hard since you lost your parents, but you're a great kid.
I just hope for your own sake,

You are going to summer camp.

-[all cheering] -Hi, George.
[George] Come on. [Will] You didn't tell me this was church camp.
-Hey, David. -Hey!
It's the last week of summer. Are you ready?
Five hundred percent. Leaves and hearts will be a-changing.
Yes! So what do you have planned for the tribunal?
It's pretty exciting. Two words.
[in Scottish accent] Braveheart!
Well, that's actually one word.
Oh! Look, here's Will Hawkins' file.
-Oh, right. -Social Services put everything in there.
What's this? Is this real?
He tried to sell his high school on Craigslist? -Mm-hmm! That boy got three offers. -[chuckles] Okay.
-Mm-hmm! That boy got three offers. -[chuckles] Okay.
Uh, is this kid something I gotta be worried about?
I seem to remember a certain bad boy back in the day.
Yeah, back when I had a glorious head of man-hair.
[laughs] Relax, Fabio. Will will be fine.
George is showing him the ropes. It's actually kinda cute.
-You got him staying in the-- -Yeah, the legit cabin.
-Yeah, it's, um… -It's…
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-It is. -It is.
Mmm. She's a classic.
That's a word for it.
Hello, old friend.
You actually chose this cabin?
Yeah, I mean, who wouldn't?
The toilet backs up, when it works. There's no AC… Oh, and the spiders.
Spiders?
I guess they haven't come out yet. Anyway.
Oh, by the way, what was that back there? The whole family slash cousins thing?
[stammering] I don't mean to be a prude, but lying's up there on the top ten  "Thou shalt nots."
I wasn't ready. It made me kinda uncomfortable.
-It doesn't really fly-- -Yeah, I totally get it.
-Oh, you get it? -[Will] Yeah, I do.
[chuckles] Great. That's a relief 'cause I'm not trying to be uncool.
You like the view.
What?
The view.
-No, that's not it at all. -Careful. Lies are up there.
What's her name?
[George] Presley Elizabeth Borsky.
Dean's list four years straight.
Loves all things cute and cuddly, specifically anything pug-related.
[chuckles] She wears the perfect little shoe size.
Seven and a half, narrow.
We're gonna have to work on this stalker vibe you got going on.
What about Avery? What's her story?
[chuckles] Way out of your league. Trust me.
Really? Ouch.
Yeah, how should I say this?
I don't know if she'd be into the whole "stealing a cop car" kinda guy.
First of all, borrowed a cop car. Second of all, how did you even know that?
Oh. Georgie's got ears everywhere.
[sighs] Well, then, what would she be into? Like, what's her deal?
Uh, this camp, honestly. She practically lives here. Her dad owns the place.
What about her mom?
Let me guess, she's off saving the world like Mother Teresa.
No. She's…
Doesn't really talk about it.
She spends most of the summer as a counselor and, uh,
this is the only time she gets to be a normal camper like us.
And watch out, she's crazy competitive.
[chuckles] That makes two of us.
George, you said that telling the truth wasn't an option.
No. I'm just not super sure Avery would be into it.
That kinda sounds like the same thing, dude.
I have to make this camp thing work. Okay?
If I'm going to fit here, I have to be something I'm not.
That's where you come in. -Right, Georgie? -Um…
How about this? If you help me, then I'll help you
with Miss Presley Elizabeth Borscht.
-Borscht? Barber? -[George] Borsky.
[Will] Borksy! Right. All you gotta do is keep our secret, show me the ropes.
That's it.
So I guess I'd be like…
[imitating Yoda] Your Yoda, I will be.
-Yes. Sure. My Yoda. -[continues in Yoda voice] Mmm.
-Lesson one, my young Padawan. -You can stop talking like that.
Shorts, wear them, you must.
[in normal voice] You're welcome. Got plenty. Welcome to camp.
You're a really weird dude.
Thank you.
Why are they so itchy?
Polyester blend. Or as I like to call it, God's gift to fashion.
I smell like old people.
This is my super real cousin Will, just visiting from out of town.
-We're related. -Easy, tiger.
-[Will] What's the plan, Rain Man? -[George] Take your pick.
-Archery, baking club-- -Oh, what about that?
[Will] Nope. Don't do heights.
Okay, we are definitely signing up for that.
Uh, no paintball, I never do paintball, I wasn't really built for that.
-Today's the day. -No, stop, don't go over there.
-I don't want to. Don't invalidate me. -Hey, guys, how's it going?
Hey! It's, um, it's Will, right?
-Ah! Good memory, um, Avery. -Thanks. Funny.
-Let me guess, you're on the red team? -Yeah, Crimson Angels.
Did you come up with that name?
Why?
I'm just trying to decide how honest to be in my opinion.
Oh! That's funny. I, uh, was thinking the same thing about your shorts.
-[chuckling] Touché. -[Avery laughs]
And you must be Presley.
-Yeah, hi, nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you.
Hey, George.
George was actually just telling me all about you earlier.
-Really? -No, no, no-- -Nothing weird or anything. -Right.
-I-- We're cousins for the summer. -I love the summer.
-He's my cousin and we're here. -Cool.
-The summer. -It's okay.
I was just showing him around. No biggie.
That's awesome, George. [chuckles]
[George] Y-yeah.
-This'll be fun to do it together. -[George clears throat]
-Where do I sign? -Here.
-[George] Don't write my name. Forgery. -I'm signing your name.
-[Avery] You'll be great. -Excited, because…
-There we go. --[George clears throat] [Avery] Thanks.
Good luck, Will…
Hawkins.
You're gonna need it.
-Luck? -[Avery] Yeah.
-Okay. -[Avery] Okay.
-See you there. -See you around, George. Mm-hmm.
-Let's go. -Yeah.
That was good. You looked good. That time.
-Dude, what was that? -I know. [groans]
I can talk to anybody but Presley. It sucks.
So, it looks like George still has a thing for you.
Come on, he can't even look at me.
Presley could have any guy she wants. Trust me, all right? I tried last year.
I wrote her a letter every single day.
I didn't ever send them. Maybe you should invest in some stamps.
I'm telling you, if the two of you just would talk.
You just gotta talk to her.
Yeah.
Dude, come on.

-[George] Lay of the land. -[Will] Hit me.
Camp's divided into three teams. I'm Verdes Maximus.
-[Sean] Georgie boy and new kid! -Looking good, Stuart.
-Excuse me? Did you call me Stuart? -He's turning around.
Oh my gosh. Why did you do that?
-[George] Hey, hey, hey. -Hey man, it's Sean. My name is Sean.
-That's what I said, right? -That's what I heard.
-Right? -Whatever.
Georgie, we're gonna destroy you this year.
-Mmm-hmm. -[Sean] Because what? We haven't lost in how long?
Oh yeah, that's right.
♪ Never ♪
-Yeah. Mmm. -Wow. -Good ear. -A long time.
Maybe you'll be one of my Apostles, Will.
-Really? -Yeah.
If you have Apostles, doesn't that make you--
-Winners! Yes! -[Will] Okay, got it.
So, you're a team of Apostles. Got it.
For a second there I thought you might have an over inflated sense of self.
The thing is, I'm not sure I'm brave enough
to pull off one of those t-shirts in public, I'll have to pass.
Oh. That's a shame because I sell these t-shirts
to raise money for a cause close to my heart.
-I think that's him on there. -On that narwhal.
Anyways, your team's not a choice.
We'll see what happens tonight at the tribunal.
Can't wait.
Great. Awesome. I'll see you gentlemen tonight.
-See you tonight. -You will.
-Apostles out. -See you there.
Great!
-Okay, let's be on our way. -Will.
[Will] What is this tribunal thing?
We're gathered here tonight on this hallowed ground
beneath the great moon and stars, to honor an age old tradition.
Welcome to the tribunal!
[David] Newbies! Rise!
From this day forth,
you'll be part of your tribe, and your tribe will be part of you.
And you forever
will be part of us all.
Come forth!
Crimson Angel!
Azure Apostle!
Crimson Angel!
Good to meet you, Will.
You too.
[David] All right.
Verdes Maximus!
I pulled some strings. Pretty cool, huh? [chuckles] You're one of us now.

[Kristin] Let the games begin!
[David] Good morning, campers. It's a beautiful sunny day. Everybody up. Everybody moving.
It's time to get this party grooving.
As you know, another year of Warrior Games is at hand.
Will the Apostles hold onto their lead?
Or will another team rise from the ashes and claim their throne?
Good morning, campers. It is a beautiful sunny day.
Everybody up. Everybody moving. It's time to get this party grooving.
[Will] Just make it stop.
-Hello. Earth to Will. -Go away.
We get to kick total butt today.
Finally show Sean and his mini-me's how Jedis get it done.
-It's gonna be epic. -No, it's not going to be epic.
I'm 17.6 miles from civilization and surrounded by Jesus freaks.
Wow. I feel like I should be offended but I'm actually just impressed
with your geographical skills. Like, did you just know that?
Rule number one: always have an exit plan.
-That's rule number one? -Yes, it is.
Problem is, all roads lead to juvie this time.
Yeah, but this time you got a George.
He's not going to let you leave. Right? I need you for the talent show.
You're what I need to bring the performance over the top.
-And it's gonna be epic. -Please stop saying that.
Well, it's true. I'll quit if you quit with the "boo-hoo,
I'd rather be anywhere than this place because I'm so broody and cool."
It's not a good look, even I know that.
Look, you have a chance to do something really solid this week.
Help me win for the first time in my life. Bonus, hang with Avery.
And, who knows, maybe you'll have a little bit of fun.
Like, by accident?
So, stop whining.
Suck it up.
And help me kick some [singing] ♪ Apostle behind ♪
-That was a pretty solid pep talk, George. -Thank you.
Did you practice that?
I did. Was the singing too much? I couldn't decide.
-No, that's what got me. -The singing?
-Mm-hmm. -Nice.
Want some Ovaltine? Apple Jacks?
-No, I'm good. I got Twizzlers. -Nice.
Why would you get more of this?
I like it. It's camp.
-It's gross, is what it is. -You're supposed to get a bun. -Ugh! -All right.
[Sean] All right!
Five minutes!
[all] Five minutes!
Five minutes!
[all chanting] Five minutes!
-What's going on? -You're not gonna like it.
All right! The people have spoken.
-Will Hawkins! -There it is.
-Oh! -It's time for your five minutes of fame. -Five minutes? -Get there.
[Avery] Five minutes!
[all chanting] Five minutes!
Five minutes!
-Get up there. -Okay, I'll do it.
-[Sean] Let's give it up for the new kid! -Wish me luck.
[George] I believe in you!
[Sean] The name is William Hawkins.
The game is five minutes of fame.
And the name of the game is to find out who the mysterious new kid really is.
Mysterious? Huh.
-[whooping] -Okay, all right.
Bring it on.
Favorite color?
Green, of course.
-Profession? -Teenager.
-Favorite movie? -Twilight.
-[applause] -You good at sports?
If awesome is good then yeah.
-Celebrity crush? -[Will] Bella Swan.
Real crush?
-I'm still going with Bella. -[campers laughing]
-[girl] Biggest regret? -Sitting here.
Favorite book of the Bible?
Ah, man, you know, I-I couldn't pick just one.
Oh, I totally get that.
Who's your hero?
My dad.
Your favorite person?
My mom.
[chuckles] Okay, all right!
Let's give it up for the new kid, huh?
[Sean] All right, who's next?
How about Georgie boy? I believe in you, cuz.
-I don't know! -Come on! Come on up here.
George! George! George!
-Okay, okay. -[campers chanting] George! George!
All right! Okay.
-You're welcome. -[David] Will.
Thanks a lot.
-Whatever happened, I swear it wasn't me. -Oh, you can relax.
I don't believe for a second you're a Twilight fan. You don't seem the type.
-Don't judge a book by its cover. -I never do.
I just wanna say I'm glad you're here, Will.
That's it. So I called you out here. Glad you're here.
Well, thanks. Hey, by the way, what's with the name? Aweegaway?
Yeah, no, it's Aweegaway.
You guys are taking a week away to hang out with us.
Oh, yeah, that makes more sense.
And bonus, every once in a while, somebody finds out they're a week away
from an experience that changed everything for them. My favorite part.
Here I was thinking you were a funny guy who was a little too into Braveheart.
You're right, I am a funny guy and I do love Braveheart.
-But don't judge a book by its cover. -Touché.
One last thing. Don't put my camp on Craigslist.
-I won't. -Okay, thank you. Well, it's time.
-For what? -[siren blares]
Warrior Games, baby!
-Wow. -[David] Warrior Games! -Hear ya. -Man, is that Will Hawkins, the new kid?
-Hear ya. -Man, is that Will Hawkins, the new kid?
Thanks a lot. You set the bar high in there.
-I'm sure you were great. -If awesome is good then yeah.
-[Will chuckles] -Oh my gosh. Everyone's talking about you and Sean hates it.
-Will! -Tragic.
-That was so impressive. -Oh, thank you.
Yeah, I mean, anyone can answer questions, but it is about to get real. -[George chuckles] -[Sean] Whoo!
Warrior Games, baby!
What he said.
-Whoo! -[Avery] That's right.
-You're gonna beat the blob this year. -That's because I love the blob.
-This girl loves the blob. -I do love the blob.
-That's why I do it, Sean. -I love the blob too.
-Really? -I do.
-You love the blob? I thought you-- -George, you know me. I love that thing.
-Great. -My friends call me "blobtastic."
-That's cool. -Really? You like can't get them to stop?
I've tried, but they just seem too overwhelmed by my skills.
Of course.
Ah, well, look, don't feel bad because when I beat you I won't think any less of you.
Okay.
Mr. Blobtastic.
You can call me Will.
Uh, eh-- Bye. Bye, George. [chuckles]
I didn't know you blobbed. If we go now we could get practice jumps before anyone else.
If we go now we could get practice jumps before anyone else. You wanna? Come on!
Wait, back up, jumps? You didn't say there were gonna be jumps.
George!
[George] Time to fly.
Can you give me something extra on the jump?
The further I go, the higher we score.
-Hello? -Huh?
Dude, that's pretty tall.
Yeah, it's the blob. Wait, have you never--
No.
Yeah, great. Well, Blobtastic, today's the day.

Thank you.
She's right there. Just go check on her.
-Come on, you can do this. -No.
George.
It's really not that bad, you know. Sorry. I have a bag of peas on my face, Avery.
Yeah, but your hair… it's never looked better.
Really?
No, it's actually really frizzy and it's a little flat.
-George, what are you doing? -I can't go out there, forget it.
-Stop pacing. Please. -[groans]
Stop!
You just don't understand. I'll never be the guy who gets the girl.
I'm Duckie. What can I say?
What? You are the cool guy, George.
-You're kinda the coolest. -I'm a sucker.
You gotta go out there and get her. This is your moment.
-Like one of those Jeff Hughes movies. -John Hughes.
-John Hughes. -That's it! You have to John Hughes me.
What?

We go to the mall, you get me a leather jacket, jeans with rips in 'em,

Everybody up. Everybody moving. It's time to get this party grooving.

Oh, sorry, I… I was just walking.
-I didn't mean to-- -No, it's cool.
I thought I'd come here, watch the sunrise. Mh.
And George is a little perky for me in the morning. -So… -[chuckles]
[Avery] Yeah.
Is that, um… something that you wrote?
Uh, just a little something I've been working on.
So he's Mr. Blobtastic and he plays the guitar.
That is pretty impressive.
All right, I'm up here writing moody sunrise songs. What's your excuse?
You know, it's kind of a personal thing, but if you wanted to, you could come.
Pass up a mystery outing?
Let's do it.
[Avery] Just over here.
Are you taking me to some secret hideout?
[chuckles] Sort of.
-Should I be alarmed? -No!
Okay, just checking basics.
Y'know, I'm kinda a big deal at camp,
so if I go missing, people will come looking.
-Will they? -Mmm-hmm.
Really?
[Will] Wow.
[Avery] Pretty amazing, huh?
I come here every year.
It is pretty much my favorite place on the planet.
-I can see why. -[chuckles]
When I was little my, um…
my mom, she got sick.
And so my dad and I wanted to create a place
that was magical for her when she wasn't in the hospital, so…
we made this.
My mom, her favorite were the butterflies. There are some now,
but you come back in the spring, I'm telling you, you… you would not believe it.
Y'know, it's been almost eleven years.
But she's still here.
Doesn't it hurt?
Being here?
Well, yeah.
Of course, I miss her, every day, but…
I know that it's just temporary.
-So you'll see her again? -A hundred percent.
A hundred percent? Wow.
I mean, I guess I don't, I don't know-know that, but…
Yeah, no, I just choose to believe. I mean that's faith, right?
What about you?
What?
Oh yeah. Uh, me too.
Yeah, I was just testing you.
[chuckles] Right.
Okay, well, how did I do?
Nailed it. Of course.
You're pretty perfect, aren't you?
No.
No, I'm not.
-It's okay, you can admit it. -No, I can't though, because I'm not.
Look, to be honest with you, and I know you didn't mean it in a bad way or anything, it's just…
I hate that word.
Y'know, perfect, it's just impossible.
It's like I find myself doing this thing I know that I shouldn't but,
I'm, like, trying to be what everybody expects me to be, and it is exhausting.
Well, I didn't mean it like that.
I know, I…
It just seems like you have it all figured out.

Okay, David, you do realize they're kids, right?
-I know. -[Kristin] Okay.
Charlie! No more head shots.
And remember, watch your six.
Not the 666.
No, I was… The six is your back. 'Cause if you say twelve it would be…
I hope you know how to shoot that thing.
-Not the devil! -No, this is not a Biblical term at all.
Okay. All right, gotcha.
[David] Move out!
-Move it! -[Kristin] Jesus loves you!
Move it!
[Charlie] Slay 'em all!
-Charlie's really enthusiastic. -Yeah, we've got to call his parents.
All right, Apostles, listen up. It is beyond go time.
Now just go out there, okay, and do your best.  Now, I believe in you.
This is our year, 'cause we have something they don't have. We have Will.
I want the new kid taken out first. Understand?
Do you think they all know what Apocalypse Now is?
I don't even know what Apocalypse Now is, David.
-Now, what are we? -[all] Red hot!
Sorry, I can't hear you. What?

What are we gonna do?
-Destroy. -Yes.

I told you, Will, I'm competitive.
Excuse me boys.
That's it! Crimson Angels are the winner!
-[Crimsons cheer] -Looks like we're both losers today. Just go.
Part of me is proud, and part of me is neutral.
I think we got a barn burner!
Verdes Maximus is in second place!
[Kristin] That's my baby! He came from my womb.
And in third place just a couple of points down the Azure Apostles.
Oh, no, no. This doesn't happen.
Third place!
I pray. I give blood. What is happening?
I'm an Apostle. I went to the Arctic and I spent two months freezing my buttocks off
and I spent two months freezing my buttocks off to come back here and we lose.
We lose to some guy, George's cousin. Who is that guy?
Hello, Mr. Godzilla. That looks like a tasty Twizzler you have in your mouth.
-[roaring] -Oh! Thank you so much.
I'm going to keep this Twizzler.

-So good. -Dude, it's a classic.
[Will] You know? This camp thing's not that bad.
[George] You ain't seen nothing yet.
[Kristin] I just have one simple thing to say.
I don't know all of you…
certainly not as well as I'd like to.
But God does.
He knows everything about each and every one of you here tonight.
I don't know much, but this much I do.
He's a fan.
I don't know much.
But I…
-Err… uh… -But this much I do.
Seeing George hit that superman pose trying to save a certain someone.
That was, uh…
That was pretty cool, man.
That was pretty cool.
-Thanks. -Yeah.
Well, I don't know much, but this much I do.
This is the last week of our 24th summer here at Camp Aweegaway.
As my wife used to say, God is up to something.
He's up to something good.
He's up to something amazing.
That much I know.
I've repeated this quite a few times to myself.
And um…
These words just mean a lot to me, so I thought why not share them.
"For I know the plans that I have in store for you declares the Lord…
plans to prosper you…
not to harm you…
plans to give you a hope…
and a future."
I don't know much.
But this much I do.

That was really cool what you said about George, I thought.
I think Presley liked it too I mean, she loved it.
Hey, um… How are y-- How are you feeling about all that? Because I know it can be… overwhelming.
It was amazing.
Really?
I don't know.
It's just… been so long
since I felt so…
connected.
Like I was part of something bigger.
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, I really do.
-Avery. -Will.
-Sorry. -Go head.
Just, can you wait just like two seconds? I have something for you.
-Oh yeah, sure. -But just two seconds, okay?
Sorry.
Come on, just tell her the truth.
I, um…
I just wanted you to have this photo.
You don't have to keep it if it's weird. I just, um…
I don't know, it's a good picture.
Avery, I…
Yeah?
Thank you.
Yeah, it's no problem.
-So, I'll see you tomorrow. -Yeah, see you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
Okay.
Goodnight.
-Oh, hey, Kristin. -Hey, Will.
Hey, lover boy. How's Avery?
She gave me this.
Man, I look good in this. Mind if I steal it?
Yeah, I do. [chuckles]
[Kristin] Oh, Will, this is yours.
Thanks.
Oh, wow, are those your parents?
That's them.
Can I see?
Sure.
-You look just like your dad. -What?
-Yeah. -Really?
-You got a lot of peach fuzz though. -Peach fuzz? [chuckles]
Will, your mother is beautiful.
She really is.
You know, your parents would be really proud of you.
They'd be glad I was here.
I just thought the moment needed a heartfelt score, it was so tender.
Nice, George.
You know what would be heartfelt? If you picked up your drawers.
[George] Mom. Come on, I just wore them. Do you expect me to clean my room at camp?
-[Kristin] Why does it smell so bad? -[George] Boys only.
[Kristin] That boy stink that just sticks on you.
[George] They smell like old people. [Kristin] I can smell your shorts. How long you been wearing them?
[Kristin] I can smell your shorts. How long you been wearing them? [George] They were pants.
[whispering] Gotcha.
No way.
-[reveille playing] -[David] All right, campers, now for a Warrior Games update.
In first place the Azure Apostles.
In second the Angels, and finally Verdes Maximus coming in third.
Now, don't despair, I have it from authority on high
that the talent show tonight is gonna be a game changer.
So warm up those juggling balls,
polish off those tap shoes, and let's make some magic!
All right, my fellow Verdes Maximus monsters,
today is the day and if we all do our jobs I think tears will be shed,
jaws will be dropped,
-and heartstrings will be tugged. -[all chuckling]
We didn't come this far to be just okay.
-We must be-- -Epic.
-What he said. -[chuckles]
Let's give it up for our fearless leader who put this nonsense together, huh?
Okay, we're a team. But, yes, as the leader I appreciate the validation.
[Will] Let's get started.
I am excited.
It'll be nice to have some decent talent show competition.
-Yeah, this is a closed rehearsal, Sean. -I'm aware.
I heard the new kid would be playing a big part in this year's performance.
So I wanted to stop by and offer a few pointers. Will, got a minute?
-No, we have to rehearse. -It's fine.
Sean, if this is about paintball, I'm sorry, I just--
Hey, you're good. You're good. You can't change who you are. I get it.
You can't change who you are. I get it.
What's that supposed to mean?
Like, who you really are.
Will Hawkins.
Vandalism,
disorderly conduct, curfew violations.
Auto theft?
You lied.
You're just a big fraud.
And you need to tell Avery.
Or I'm going to.
Look.
I'm trying to do the right thing.
Yeah.
Sure you are.
Keep up the good work.
Hey.
-Uh, hey. Hi, George. -Okay.
-Uh, hey. Hi, George. -Okay. Have you guys seen Will?
-Why? What's up? -I don't know.
We were trying to rehearse, Sean walked in, said something to him
and then Will just walked out. W-wait, Sean? What did Sean say?
I have no idea.
All right, let's go find out.
-[groans] -[Avery] Come on.
[Sean] I don't want to tell you this.
Will isn't who he says he is.
What are you talking about?
Ask his cousin.
[Sean] Six years, seven schools, twenty-two homes.
You can't change who you are. I get it. [Kristin] Your parents would be proud of you.
[Sean] Vandalism, disorderly conduct.
I don't know if she'd be into the whole stealing a cop car.
[Avery] I just choose to believe. I mean, that's faith, right?
[Sean] You're just a big fraud.
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.
He's lying to you. You've gotta believe me.
You're so brave.
[Will] Always have an exit plan.
Will.
-Dad! Hi! -Hi, sweetie.
-Uh, can I have your keys? -Where are you going?
Sean, I guess said something to Will.
I don't know what he said. All I know is I checked his cabin.
All of his things are gone, he's gone.
-Well, I'll go look for him. -No, no.
I need to go.
I think he was trying to say something to me the other day
or I don't know, but if I go I think he'll listen to me.
Please, you have to trust me.
[Avery] Will.
Will. Will come on, please, where are you going?
Look, I… I know everything, okay? Or at least I know some of it.
None of it matters, so can you please get in the car?
-We can talk about it. -There's nothing to talk about.
So do you just run away?
-Is that you? Is that the real Will? -I don't have anybody, Avery.
I don't have a dad to take care of me or a little magical garden.
That was not fair.
Yeah, you're right. It's not.
It's not fair that my parents were ripped from me.
[voice breaks] That I didn't get to tell them just once more…
You don't know anything about me. So don't pretend you do or that you care.
Why do you think I'm standing here now?
-I don't know, you tell me. -Because I care.
-Because you are so loved. -By whom? God?
Yes!
Then where was he? Where was he?
He didn't take me that night, no. He left me there.
He wasn't there for me that night, hasn't been there since.
What kind of a God is that?
Tell me.
But you know what? It's fine. I'm fine. Okay?
You're not gonna believe me right now, when I say this to you but I need you to--
I don't need you to fix me, Avery.
-I'm not trying to fix you, Will. -Yeah, right.
Fine, then you look at me right now.
-Tell me none of this meant anything. -Get out of my way.
I can't. Because you can't look at me and you can't say it.
-Because you know it's not true. -It meant nothing to me.
What?
None of it.
Can I go now.
Yeah, you can go now.
By the way, you aren't as good of a liar as you think you are.

[David] Wow! Kristin, I'm looking at the numbers and with that performance
the Azure Apostles take a commanding lead.
We're dead.
You tried your best, okay? It's gonna be fine. We're gonna have fun, okay?
I know.
Did you find him?
Yeah.
-Yeah, no, I found him. -Wait, what's going on? Are you okay?
-[Presley] She. George, she, um-- -I tried.
I don't think he's coming back.
But it's not over yet! We have our final performance, Verdes Maximus!

I want to say that I'm proud of all of you. But in the end, Kristin,
only one team can reign supreme, and who is it tonight?
Verdes Maximus!
It's all right. It's all right.
[Will and George] Good morning, campers. It's a beautiful sunny day.
Everybody up. Everybody moving.
[David over PA] Time to get this party grooving.
-[vocalizing] -It was a week unlike any other.
Today you take home friendships that will last a lifetime.
Remember that today is not goodbye, it's see you later.
Go out in the world, the great big awesome world and make some magic.
[Sean] I want to say congratulations. -You killed it. -[chuckles]
Thanks, man. It means a lot.
You deserve it.
You can do this.
-Can I talk to you? -Yeah, what's up?
Man, I just… just want to say I'm sorry.
You weren't the only one trying to impress people.
Dude, don't even worry about it. We're cool.
Yeah, but next year you're going down.
Ahh, we'll see about that.
-[singing] ♪ Later ♪ -See you, buddy.
-Hey, you. -Hey, mind if I sit here?
Please.
So… are you coming back next year or what?
Hmm, well, that depends. Will you be here?
Yes.
Then chances are pretty good.
Hi.
Hey.
I-I-I, um…
Here.
It's beautiful, George.
Um, yeah, the-there are 365 letters in there for you. Um, I kinda wrote them last year
but I think thematically they could…
I'm sorry. [chuckles nervously]
It's just, um…
"Life moves pretty fast.

Not if I marry you first George Montgomery Tanella.

See ya.
She gave me her number.
[chuckling] She gave me her number, I…
Jeez. Should I, like, emoji her? Is that a thing?
[George] So what happens next?
[Will] I don't know. Figure out my next move.
-I'm gonna miss you, man. -I'm gonna miss you too.
All right. You boys ready to go home?
What do you mean?
Will, I'd really like for you to come home and live with us.
I mean, If you want.

The pulse of eternal knowledge.
When you sense the oneness...
you are with us.
We brought life to Earth.
You can't see us,
but we flourish all around you.
Everywhere.
In everything.
And even inside you,
whether you believe in us or not.
From your first breath to your last,
and in the light, in darkness
we are the oldest and youngest.
We are the largest and smallest.
of a billion years. We are the wisdom
We are creation.
We are resurrection, and regeneration. condemnation,
and regeneration. condemnation,
We are mushrooms.
Mushrooms are very clandestine and very much the trickster. [Paul Stamets]
from you all the time. So, they're hiding
We're in Agarikon territory now.
living snags up here. There're some big
It's always interesting to be in the old growth forest, and exhilarating but not always rewarding
but not always rewarding in accomplishing our mission to find a new Agarikon strain,
but nevertheless,
it beats being in the office.
Fungi are the grand molecular decomposers of nature.
Now, what does that mean? Well, they break down wood,
and here I'm laying in the forest. I haven't peeked yet,
but here's a piece of wood laying down on the ground.
on the ground and I died, If I was laying down
fungi would leap up to recycle me. Well, that's the way of nature.
Mushrooms represent rebirth,
rejuvenation, regeneration.
Fungi generate soil that gives life.
The task that we face today the language of nature. is to understand
My mission is to discover the language of nature of the fungal networks
My mission is to discover the language of nature of the fungal networks with the ecosystem, that communicate
nature is intelligent. and I believe
to communicate with nature The fact that we lack the language skills
does not impugn the concept that nature's intelligent.
It speaks to our inadequacy for communication.
If we don't get our act together and come in commonality and understanding
If we don't get our act together and come in commonality and understanding that sustain us today, with the organisms
not only will we destroy those organisms, destroy ourselves. but we will
It's not like a vegetable, Mushroom. but it's somewhere in between. and it's not like a animal,
own kingdom altogether. The fungus is its
1.5 million species. There's over
That's six times more than plants.
Of all those species of fungi, produce mushrooms, about 20,000
in an incredible diversity and mushrooms come
and colors and lifestyles. of shapes and sizes
bioluminescent mushrooms. There are even
A lot of people are afraid of mushrooms.
and fungi-- you know, mold-- People associate mushrooms
with death and decay, which makes sense.
there's a lot of fear You know, because of fungi's role in the cycle of life.
They decompose dead and dying organisms
and move all those nutrients back into the cycle.
at the very end of stuff, They kind of are at the beginning. but they're also
[Michael Pollan] Once you start working with mushrooms, you get drawn in.
A really important difference between plants and fungi
is that plants have evolved to catch your eye.
When a tomato gets red, "Hey, I'm ready. Come get me." it is saying,
The mushrooms don't give a shit.
They're doing their own thing, and a lot of them are hiding.
Every time you pick up a mushroom, with the omnivore's dilemma. you are faced
Do I know enough to eat this? Should I eat this?
Will this kill me?
of the reasons why And that's one about mushrooms, because yeah, people are freaked out
that can kill you. there are ones
There are some that'll take out your liver or your kidneys,
there's berries in the woods but to be honest with you, that can kill you too.
of knowing your mushrooms. So, it's really a matter
There's a huge subculture of mycophiles, of people who are fascinated with mushrooms.
eat mushrooms together, They hunt mushrooms together, and they
of bloated pleasure seekers and they're sort with a scientific bent.

This is a tricholoma. [Gary Lincoff]
Grifola frondosa. [Bone]
Cortinarius ludogriseus. [Lincoff] This is
Agaricus bisporus. [Bone]
That's a Cladonia lichen.

It changed the way I saw everything.
were the window by which Mushrooms actually
I came to understand nature in a deeper way.
If we didn't have fungi, [Stamets]
we would get this buildup would choke the Earth. of plant matter that
They really are the key.
They break down plant life and make it usable and for animal life. for new plant life
[Bone] They are the digestive tracts of the forest.
One of the lifestyles of fungi is as decomposers,
called saprobes or rotters, if you want.
The yeasts and molds used in making beer and wine and cheese are all saprobes.

to break things down But this ability is a talent, if you will,
that can be harnessed of our problems like pollution. to help us deal with some

so that includes stuff like oil spills,
pollutant problems. of the truth of it. That's kind
[Stamets] I was a part of this experiment.
There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste.
One was a control pile, one pile was treated with enzymes,
one pile treated with a bacteria, and our pile, we inoculated with mushroom spores.
The fungi absorbs the oil,
so the fungi is producing enzymes for oxidases
carbon-hydrogen bonds. that break
These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together.
So the fungi becomes saturated with oil.
we returned six weeks later, all the tarps were removed. And then when
were dead, dark and stinky. We came back to our pile. All the other piles
It was covered with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms. are very happy mushrooms. Some of these mushrooms
are very happy mushrooms. Some of these mushrooms They were very large,
by showing how much nutrition that they could obtain.
But something else happened, which was an epiphany in my life.
They sporulated. The spores attract insects.
bringing in seeds, Birds then came, and our pile became an oasis of life.
the fruiting bodies of fungi. [Bone] Mushrooms are

The bulk of the organism is growing underground
of these long threads and it's composed
and these threads grow one cell at a time
and then they branch and rebranch,

[P. Stamets] I couldn't get these mushrooms for the longest time. When I was in Ohio,
When I was in Ohio, a bag of magic mushrooms, I actually purchased
but I had no guide. I had no recommendations for how much to consume.
So I had a bag about this big, so I thought, "Well, that's probably one dose."
So I consumed the bag!
Now, for those of you who don't know, this is like ten times more than you probably need to consume.
It was a warm summer day,
and there was a beautiful big, big tree, an oak tree,
and then I noticed the black clouds on the horizon,

And so I thought I need to stop stuttering.
And so I said to myself, "Stop stuttering.

I started saying that. "Stop stuttering now. Stop stuttering now."

And one of them is the world's number 1.
You might ask, "So what?"
What if I tell you
that the whole thing started from a crazy father?
So crazy that he thought he could turn his two girls
into world-class golfers.
Now you wonder how he could pull that off, right?
Let me tell you the whole story then.

Don't you think that's too much to ask from the school?
I...
I mean, are you sure...
that this won't affect the development of your daughters?
Do you think I'll put my girls through 15 years of school
and they'll graduate...
and then what?
They'd study hard...
only to get a piece of paper then beg companies to give them jobs?
Do you seriously think I should let them go through that?
I'm talking about their education.
Girls their age need proper education.
It's important for them to have friends and join activities.
I only finished grade 4, but now I have my own business.
I definitely have more money in my bank account than you.

[Dad] Forget the teacher.
You ignored my instruction.
I said to come out at 12 p.m. sharp, didn't I?
[Mom] The class wasn't finished. How could they come out?
We've already got special treatment.
[Dad] Shit. Just do exactly what I tell you to.
Never break my rules.
[Mom] They're just half an hour late.
[Dad] You're talking back now?
They slack off because you're weak.
My rules aren't flexible.
Drill and discipline, get it?
I'm so goddamn tired. Don't be a dead weight, okay?
If either of you misses the flag, I will punish you both.
Get ready.
That's why your chips suck.
Move your legs.
Line them up with the target. Don't splay them. Close them.
Don't twist your palms when you follow through.
Eyes on the ball. Don't look up.
Mo, you too. Don't lob it too high.

Do you want your birthday cake?
Too bad. You threw the vegetables out of the car the other day.
This is the price you have to pay.

[narrator] That was how their amazing careers started.
The girls had beaten everyone in Thailand at such young ages.
But the amazing story didn't just end there.

This was just the beginning.
THREE YEARS BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT
This tin can is a hole.
This desk is a golf course.
What is tee off?
-It's where the play starts at each hole. -Correct.
A par-4.
How many strokes are you allowed to take?
Four.
Correct.
Sinking the ball in four strokes on a par-4 hole
means you are okay.
But if you suck and have to take the fifth shot, what's that called?
[stuttering] Bir...
Birdie?
Birdie my ass.
That's why your writing has so many mistakes.
If you have to hit five strokes on a par-4, it's a bogey.
And if you're good and take only three strokes...
it's called a birdie.
Go fix your copy and file it again.
-Okay? -Yes.
[sighs] And put my desk in order too.
-[May] Sis. -[Mo] Hmm?
What do we do about the field trip?
Everyone has returned the form to the teacher.
Shall we forge his signature?
[May] What do we do? We have to tell the teacher.
-Yui. -Yui.
-Please, Yui. -Please.
-Please ask Dad to let us go. -Please, Yui.
We've never been on a field trip, like, ever.
Right.
It's just the planetarium. The whole class is going.
-Please. -Please, Yui.
Why me? You know he'll scream at me.
Why don't you ask your mother to do it?
[Mo] No. You're the man for the job.
It has to be you.
You're a well-respected adult and a business owner.
-Dad trusts you. -Right.
-Please, Yui. -Please.
-Please. -Please.
Okay. Okay, okay.
I will try.
Yes!
Ouch.
You told Yui to ask me, didn't you?
You've agreed not to interfere with my rules!
The girls need a break.
You force them to practice without a day off.
What will they grow up to be?
They'll be professional golfers.
And all pros need discipline!
Don't you know how hard world-class golfers have to train?
Do you have any idea?
It's not about golf anymore.
It's about our family.
This is too much for them.
Family?
Look at Yui.
His mother was also soft on him!
And he failed to reach the goal I had set!
I won't let it happen again.
Mo and May will go beyond Thailand.
They'll become international stars. Remember that!
I know you have your rules and methods, and I've done everything you told me to.
I just want them to have a break sometimes.
They are still children.
They've got no friends.
They've dropped out of school.
Are you sure they're as good as you think they are?
What if they fail? All will be lost.
We will have nothing left.
I don't have confidence in them.
I have confidence in myself!
In myself, get it?
All they have to do is practice, practice, and practice.
Practice the way I tell them to!
I know you've cut Mo some slack when I'm not looking.
Now she's falling behind her sister!
May has become a much better player, you know that?
Don't pit them against each other.
I don't care!
I will do everything to push May as far as possible.
If you think your approach can help them improve,
you can take Mo, I give her to you!
May is mine. Mo is yours.
Then let's see who'll take them to the stars.
Faster. Go.
Keep moving.
Again.
Again.
[Dad] Again. The winner drives the longest, remember?
The girls were spectacular today. They stuck to my game plan.
Full swing.
Hit it harder.
Use your shoulders, not your arms.
Is that all you've got? How can you be a champion, huh?
Again! Again! Again!
Hello?
Yui. Can you do me a favor?
May, did you remember your shot...
from the bunker that day?
Your follow-through was perfect.
Straight to the hole and a birdie.
I couldn't believe my eyes.
Go to bed early.
No running tomorrow.
I'll take you to get your passports.
We are moving to the US.
Mom, why are we moving?
To play golf?
Your dad has sold the house, the car, everything.
We've got nothing left here.
UNCLE LAO NOODLES
Boss, what's so exciting about golf?
Hitting balls and walking for miles in the sun.
It doesn't look fun to me.
Do you know who's the richest athlete in the world?
Lionel Messi.
Do you know that in golf,
there are a dozen athletes as rich as Messi?
How come?
Let's say, Usain Bolt,
he would train for four years to race for ten seconds at the Olympics.
Those ten seconds will decide how rich or poor he'll become.
But there are golf tournaments every week, all year round.
So, you have a chance to win on any week of the year.
Well, but who can win every week? Even Tiger Woods wasn't even close.
Here's the thing.
In golf, you don't have to always be number 1.
If you make the top ten in every tournament,
you'll become the richest sportsperson in this country.
Now tell me, if you have a daughter, which sport do you want her to play?
Check, please.
Go back and prepare a scoop.
"The Jutanugarns are moving to America."
Moving to America...
-[phone ringing] -Yes, Sport Channel.
TWO YEARS BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT
The program is in the morning.
[Toh] Tae, a call for you.
I am on this line.
-Yes, right. -[Toh] He'll call you back.
Okay.
If the sponsors are interested, I'll call them back.
-So, I'll leave producers phone numbers. -[female voice] Hello?
Tae, check the results.
Bye now.
Guys.
Look at this.
[narrator] Well, the madman was proving everyone wrong.
Moving to the USA was pretty mad.
Moving to the USA was pretty mad. May became World No. 1, Girls' Junior.
May became World No. 1, Girls' Junior.
Who could stop them now?
Of course, when you're famous,
opportunities and sponsors line up at your doorstep.
2012, IMG HAS BECAME THE JUTANUGARN SISTERS' AGENT
Let me introduce you here.
This is Joe, and he will be your caddie from now.
JOE, ARIYA'S NEW CADDIE
And this is Winny. He will be your manager.
WIN, ARIYA'S MANAGER
Let's try this.
Do exactly the same as before and may God be with you.
She's so powerful. She can drive farther than other girls of her age.
But the driver makes it hard to control the direction.
Let her try the 3-wood instead.
She'll have more control, right?
[narrator] When your star is on the rise, it only keeps rising.
But when does it reach a limit? We have to keep watching.
Yui, can you submit the petition again?
I want May to play in the LPGA this year.
She's phenomenal. It's in the news everywhere.
[Yui] You're in the US, not Thailand. They won't bend the rules for you.
She has to be 18 to play in the tour.
Darn it. The girl has talent. Why make her wait?
She's just one year short. What's the big deal?
[Yui] Look, there's a tournament in Europe. Why don't you take her there?
MAY COMPETED IN...
May, the par-4 18th is a tough one.
SIS, HOW ARE YOU THERE? IT'S SO BORING HERE
Hey!
MO JOINED THE LPGA TOUR AT THE AGE OF 18
SIS, HOW ARE YOU THERE? IT'S SO BORING HERE
When I go back, I will eat everything I want.
Fatty.
Sis.
The next match in Pattaya,
I want to win my first tournament in Thailand.
TOURNAMENT
[narrator] As I said, everything that goes up must come down.
She was on the verge of making history
by becoming the first Thai to win an LPGA championship.
But this ball betrayed her.
That fateful putt in Pattaya would haunt May for a long time.
[Dad] You're not good enough for May and for me too!
[Joe] I just want the best for May.
If you're not happy with me, find another caddie!
[Dad] I'd like to thank all the sponsors who've been supporting us.
Without the sponsors, we wouldn't have come this far.
And a big thank you to the reporters who've followed our journey.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Hi, Uncle Nu.
Hi, May.
It's all right.
Keep trying.
-It'll be yours one day. -Thanks.
This is Tae.
Hi. Hi.
He's responsible for the golf scoop.
-He's been following your career. -Thank you.
Uncle Nu, excuse me...
-I have to... -Go on.
I understand you.
[spokesman] All right, it's time to invite May.
Never give up.
I won't.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
ONE WEEK AFTER THE TOURNAMENT
[Dad] You're terrible at putting
and chipping.
That's why I've always pushed you to drive hard.
If you had followed my plan,
you would've been the first Thai LPGA champion.
I...
I did what I thought was best under the circumstance.
And it's over. Why do you have to rub it in?
You're pigheaded.
You've stopped listening to me.
And your caddie, Joe.
He's not good enough for you. I'll fire him.
Dad.
It's my game. I'll choose my own caddie.
And Joe's been good to me.
Stop telling me what to do.
How dare you speak to me like that.
I've had your back all your life.
I've seen everything. I made you what you are now.
Joe doesn't suit you anymore.
A caddie like that will never get you near a trophy.
Is it because he's not good or is it because he doesn't listen to you?
Stop dictating my life.
I'm not your little girl anymore.
I can decide for myself what's good and what's not.
To tell you the truth...
I lost that match because of you.
If you hadn't bossed me around, I would've scored.
I am your father.
I created you.
You're here because of me.
You're my daughter. You have to listen to me.
No.
From now on, I'll play the way I want.
You have no right to order me what to do.
You're not even a pro...
remember?
When you can play better than me,
then you can tell me how to play.
-Is everything all right? -Fuck off!
-Miss, can I take these for you? -Um, no.
I'm going to finish it.
[Mom] May.
Your dad left.
He took all his stuff.
[Mo] This is all we have left.
Nine hundred and eighty dollars.
Wait.
[May] How long are we going to last?
We have a tournament in a few days.
We won't make it with just this much.
You two, stop worrying.
Focus on your game.
I will take care of everything.
[Yui] I'm trying to convince him.
But you know it's impossible to change his mind.
Let him calm down a little.
You have to be strong,
at least for Mo and May.
Thanks, Yui.
[male voice] Hello? Is anybody in there?
This is your last day here.
If you don't pay rent today, I'm gonna call the police.
You're gonna get thrown out in the street.
Do you understand?
Are you in there?
[May] From now on, I'll play the way I want to.
When you can play better than me,
then you can tell me how to play.
[Nu] After her father left,
May suffered a slump in form.
Besides slipping down the world rankings,
a new star, Kristen Lee, emerged as her rival.
From now on, you have to tell me
everything.
We are a family now.
This aisle. Go!
Slow down, you crazy girl.
Stop. Stop.
I want this.
Watch my head.
Mo, May, brush your teeth first.
Eat now.
Hey.
-Again. -Have some mackerel.
Ready to eat.
[Mo] May, what will become of us if Dad comes back?
Sometimes I feel like...
I want him to stand behind me when I'm hitting the ball.
But to come back into our family?
I don't know.
What about you?
No. I'm fine living with Mom.
-[exclaims] -Hurry up, Fatty.
-You hit me? -[exclaims]
[Mo] Come on!
[May] You hit me?
Take this!
[gasps] Darn it!
-[grunts, screams] -Come back here!
-You're playing like a girl. -[thuds]
May!
May!
Are you all right?
May!
May.
Where are you hurt?
Don't move.
I will go get help.
A dislocated shoulder
and rotator cuff tear.
Don't worry, you'll be back on the green in three to four months.
Physical therapy is extremely important.
You have to be strict with yourself, watch your diet.
MAY CAME BACK TO THAILAND TO TREAT HER SHOULDER INJURIES
Excuse me, can I have the remote?
Thanks.
[newswoman] A new star player from South Korea
has made headlines everywhere.
Kristen Lee claims
the no. 1 ranking in such a short period.
So brilliant, she's been called a genius golfer.
-[therapist] Lift yourself. -[May groans]
I do my best in every match
and every day in this match.
I will increase the pressure.
When you're done, can I have your autograph?
This win is one of my wins,
and to be the first of-- every day, or after this...
ARIYA - HIT OR MISS?
MISS THE CUT AGAIN?
[Nu] This is Tae.
He's been following your career.
Hi, this is May speaking.
[Tae] May who? The badminton player?
No, May the golfer.
Ariya Jutanugarn.
Well...
would you like to interview me?
Can we talk while I'm eating?
-Sure, let's be casual. -Okay.
Okay, shall I start?
-Yes. -Okay.
Could you update me on your injury?
It's...
getting better.
Okay.
Will it affect your future performance?
DIG FOR DIRT ABOUT HER FAMILY DRAMA
Feel free to ask me anything.
I'll answer everything I can.
Right.
What? Are you stopping?
Let's take a break. I'm hungry.
Let's eat first.
Tae.
Let me tell you a secret.
This is...
the first time in my life that I ordered noodles myself.
Can you believe it? It's so yummy.
I'm finishing it all.
I'll have another one later.
Let me tell you a secret.
The best noodle shop in the world is right next to my office.
It looks like you'll be here for a while.
But when you're out, I'll take you there.
-Really? You'll take me there? -Yes.
Let's go.
-I want to try it. -Sure.
Can I have the cap?
-Go on. -Thank you.
[newsman] All eyes in the golf world are on you at the moment.
Beside your spectacular form, you're also a beautiful woman.
What's your response to those who say that you're no. 1
only because of the injury with Ariya Jutanugarn?
I don't think like that.
I'm practicing so hard, and I work hard a lot.
So, I'm here because of myself, not because of anyone else.
It looks great.
I told you.
-Try it. -[hums]
I thought you were hungry.
-I don't know how to use chopsticks. -Use your hands then.
Go on. I won't sell your pictures.
-[May] Can I? -Of course.
-All right. -That's how they did it.
It's hot.
-Take this. -Thanks.
Taste it.
Look.
Awesome.
Mm. Where would you like to shoot the photo for the scoop?
May, let me ask you something.
Why do you collect bottle caps?
Another egg noodle bowl, tom yum soup, extra meat balls, and braised pork.
No veggies, no bean sprouts. Make that two. Thank you.
I was reading the menu.
What's up? Not enough cash?
-No, eat your fill. -Thanks.
You're welcome.
Mom!
-I miss you so much. -Fatty.
Long time no see.
-What's this? -What?
You're wearing makeup...
-And? -and a skirt.
-You don't like it? -Mm. Let's talk.
-What? -A boy?
Watch your mouth, crazy girl.
Why are you dressed like this?
For a photo shoot, at the 18th hole in Pattaya.
Now you both have to come with me.
Have you made peace with that cursed hole?
[Tae] One, two, three.
-[May] Like this? -It's good.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
-Let's pack up. -[May laughs]
Hurry.
Stop it.
[Mo] Maybe it's for the best the ball didn't go in.
If you had scored,
Dad would've been here.
I don't know.
I like this life.
The life after you failed that putt.
[Dad] All they have to do is practice, practice, and practice.
Practice the way I tell them to!
I know you've cut Mo some slack when I'm not looking.
Now she's falling behind her sister!
May has become a much better player!
I'll do everything to push May as far as possible.
If you think your approach can help them improve,
you can take Mo, I give her to you!
May is mine. Mo is yours.
I'll leave it all here...
at this hole.
When I recover...
I will become the world's no. 1.
And you...
you can take the second place.
[Mo] Fatty. Wait until I show you my power.
Do you want to hurt another shoulder?
I'll have deep-fried snapper in fish sauce,
crispy fried pork with basil, and a carbonara.
Deep-fried snapper in fish sauce, crispy fried pork with basil, a carbonara,
prawn sashimi in seafood sauce, crab omelet, and fried rice.
And an ice tea bingsu. Bring them all at the same time.
-Do you want something else? -Nope.
ARIYA "MAY" JUTANUGARN
[May] Feel free to ask me anything.
I will answer everything I can.
DIG FOR DIRT ABOUT HER FAMILY DRAMA
[Tae] Let me ask you something. Why do you collect bottle caps?
ARIYA "MAY" JUTANUGARN...
I've given you a month
to write about May Ariya.
And what's this?
A bottle cap campaign?
Nu,
I'm very disappointed.
May's the headline news. There are so many things you can dig up.
The audience is ready to believe anything.
And you got me this?
Do it all again.
I'll take care of it.
RECYCLE BOTTLE CAPS FOR OCEAN HABITATION
-[Mo] Did you bring your passport? -[May] I forgot.
Don't overact.
-You're so wicked. -Stop.
Stop it.
-Mo, May, I have something to tell you. -What?
Dad...
He's very sick.
Now he's in the hospital. He has heart disease.
He's in the ICU. He needs a bypass surgery.
But don't worry, I'm taking care of him.
MAY SUFFERED TEN MISSED CUTS
From now on, I'll play the way I want.
Joe, you told me it's 150 yards,
but you didn't tell me there's wind.
May!
May.
May is mine. Mo is yours.
[Dad] A caddie like that will never get you near a trophy.
And May God be with you.
May, are you all right?
[Mo] May.
He's gone.
My Dad.
No, he never left.
He's still somewhere deep inside you.
Do you know why I accepted to be your caddie at that time?
Because everyone in the world of golf should know you.
May Ariya.
But he's gone.
So it's your time to make your own choice.
What do you really want, May?
I want to be no. 1 in the world.
So...
what are we waiting for?
-Let's do this. -Yeah.
[newsman] The Yokohama Tire LPGA Classic 2016 is approaching.
All top pros are coming to this tournament,
including Kristen Lee, who said that she's ready to win this championship.
[broken English] My result is good. So, winner, it's sure.
[newswoman laughs] I think you worked hard. You're a winner.
-Yeah. -You're a winner today, you know?
And, uh, do you feel...
[Joe] He's still somewhere deep inside you.
[May] Hello, Uncle Nu?
May I trouble you with something?
Now, for sports news.
After suffering a slip in form and world rankings,
Pro May Ariya Jutanugarn has a chance
to rebound this week at the Yokohama Tire LPGA Classic.
Thai golf fans are sending her support.
Because I practiced so hard,
I'm gonna be a winner.
[female announcer] The yardage is exactly right,
but the flight ball is a little off target.
You are not her. You just think you are.
So, just get on with it...
and hit that ball.
[male announcer] Wow. What a shot.
That's amazing. That must be the shot of the year.
[female announcer] Ha-ha, wow. I can't believe it.
[Tae] Move left.
Set up properly.
[male announcer] Oh, wow. What a beautiful smile from Thailand.
[female announcer] Ariya's playing well and will definitely make the cut.
Welcome to the day three live coverage of the Yokohama Tire LPGA Classic.
May Ariya has narrowly made the cut.
If she wants to beat World No. 1 Kristen Lee,
she has to play her best golf.
[newsman] A phenomenal performance from Ariya.
With this form,
she has a real chance to win it on the last day.
THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT
[May] Hi, this is May speaking.
May.
I want to ask you for a favor.
Can we meet?
Sure.
UNCLE LAO NOODLES
You want me to bring you to see your dad?
You're the only person he'll listen to.
I need to get over this.
If I can't get rid of this knot in my heart...
I will never win anything.
You're just like your dad, you know that?
Do you have any idea why he and I didn't talk for ten years?
We were once very close.
We came to Bangkok from the province together.
But when we grew up, our goals became different.
The day I realized that
he was using you two to achieve his own goal...
I cut all ties with him.
In golf, the only person you have to beat is yourself.
So, you have to go and see him yourself.
[female voice] Five, four, three, two, we are live.
Welcome to the final day of LPGA Tour Yokohama Tire Classic 2016.
Today is the last day.
Ariya Jutanugarn will go head to head with World No. 1 Kristen Lee.
Will Ariya win her first LPGA championship today?
[male announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Kristen Lee.
And Ariya Jutanugarn.
[male announcer] Hole 1, par-4.
Keep your eyes on the world's no. 1.
[male announcer] She beautifully drives the ball
to the middle of the fairway.
Ariya is at the tee off and is under a lot of pressure.
[male announcer] A brilliant first shot, straight and long.
The ball goes farther than Kristen's. Superb.
[male announcer] Kristen Lee's ball is in the bunker.
This putt line is tricky.
She has to sink this putt for par.
She missed. It's a bogey for Kristen Lee.
Wonderful. Ariya scores a birdie.
Yes! That's it.
After three holes,
Ariya is leading Kristen Lee by one stroke.
[male announcer] It's a chance for her to make history for Thailand.
TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE TOURNAMENT
Dad.
How are you doing?
[male announcer] She missed again. The pressure is on Ariya.
The momentum has swung back to Kristen Lee.
She turns the situation around and now leads Ariya by three strokes.
[May] I'm concerned about your health.
You don't have to worry about my career.
I've had a lot of help lately.
Many foreign coaches have advised me.
You came all the way here to tell me this.
Did you know...
When you left me...
Mo,
and Mom...
did you know how much we suffered?
You built everything.
And all of a sudden, you walked away just like that.
How could you be so heartless?
[male announcer] An absolutely important putt.
She has to keep Kristen from pulling ahead too far.
-[audience cheering] -And Ariya's done it in a critical moment.
She's behind Kristen by two strokes. It's still possible to catch up.
The Goddess of Victory hasn't abandoned May.
Kristen Lee missed the putt, and it's a bogey.
[male announcer] Another birdie for May.
-Yeah! -Woo!
[male announcer] Two birdies in a row can turn the momentum in her favor.
She has a real chance to win it.
[male announcer] Ariya keeps making birdies on the last nine holes.
We're now at the 17th hole.
If Ariya can save par,
she'll go into the last hole with a one-stroke lead.
The championship is within her grasp now.
You won't achieve anything...
if you still have that mentality.
What a waste, after I've taught you all my life.
[Dad] What happened in Pattaya was just the beginning.
As long as you refuse to believe me...
it's hopeless
to dream of becoming the world's no. 1.
[male announcer] Unbelievable.
Ariya dropped a stroke on the 17th.
Now the score is tied with Kristen Lee at -14.
The championship will be decided on the 18th hole.
[male announcer] A wonderful first shot on the last hole
from the world's no. 1.
[Dad] Remember.
The winner is...
the one who drives the longest.
[male announcer] Ariya's drive is longer, but the ball's in the rough.
A tough next shot for her.
Kristen Lee's approach
stopped in front of the green.
Five.
[male announcer] She picked this iron, meaning she'll go for it.
But from the rough, it won't be easy.
-[audience] Aw. -No. The ball landed in the bunker.
It's the same situation as in the last hole
of Honda LPGA Tour Thailand in 2013.
[male announcer] It's Kristen's third shot.
She has all the advantages over Ariya.
Whoa, too strong.
The ball drifts beyond the hole and down the slope.
It's not going to be a walk in the park for Kristen.
Unbelievable. Kristen Lee missed her third shot.
Now it's an opportunity for Ariya and for all of Thailand.
[Dad] As long as you refuse to believe me, it's hopeless
to dream of becoming the world's no. 1.
[May] Thank you for taking me this far.
But I won't stop here.
I will be the best in the world.
[male announcer] A wonderful bunker shot.
May overcame the pressure and did it.
A decisive putt.
She has to save par with this putt in order to remain in the competition.
[male announcer] She missed.
Ariya has to save par now
to become the first Thai to win an LPGA tour.
She'll write a new chapter in the history of international golf.
[male announcer] The most important putt in Ariya's life.
The shot that will make her a champion.
I know you can do it.
-[audience cheering] -[male announcer] That's it!
Ariya Jutanugarn has won the Yokohama Tire LPGA!
Bravo!
She's the first Thai in history to ever win an LPGA tournament.
Ariya Jutanugarn!
The journey has been long and full of obstacles.
But she finally did it today.
She's brought pride to the people of Thailand.
[Nu] All right,
that was the amazing story of May Ariya Jutanugarn.
As we all know,
that victory wasn't her highest point.
After the Yokohama Classic,
she would go on to win many more tournaments
and eventually become no. 1 in the world,
full of pride.
But that's not exactly what I want to tell you.
The real story is about
how we overcome our failure
and how we move on from the lowest point in our lives.
Because we have to keep moving on.
May also keeps moving on,
no matter how disappointing or painful her experience was.
Likewise, her sister, Mo Moriya Jutanugarn,
kept improving until she reached the top ten in world rankings.
This is the story of two Thai sisters who became phenomena in the golf world.
Now, you're curious, how much truth is in this?
Hall is real,
and we hope he'd forgiven May for extorting his money
and that the boy who hated golf people...
I hate golf people!
would end up becoming a scientist.
Tae is real.
Well, sort of.
Initially, he didn't know anything about golf.
But the story of May and Mo became an inspiration
that made him want to become Thailand's no. 1 sports reporter,
which is impossible because I'm still here.
Finally, am I real?
Well, just forget it.
In fact, there's a genius in every Thai family.
How children can grow up to become geniuses
depends on how their parents prepare, support, and groom them.
No need to imitate the Jutanugarns' way.
Find your own approach,
commit to it,
and never stop until you've found your genius.

She, uh… With Mr. Jones. That's exactly…
-Right over there on Mr. Jones Way. -Oh my God. Bud.
We'd get much further if you'd be straight with me.
-I am being straight. -You're not.
I am being straight, but the question is, what is that sponge doing on the ground?
I am being straight, but the question is, what is that sponge doing on the ground? And this? What is all this?
And this? What is all this?
I am fixing the broken tile.
Mm-hmm. I see that. And why?
Uh, what does it matter?
-You don't live here anymore. -Wow, that's what we doing?
What I was gonna tell you is that this tile goes…
Joss, what's this? This a new door?
A door with five locks doesn't exactly
send the right impression to potential buyers.
Buyers? Buyers? What are you talking about, Joss?
I didn't want to tell you this way, but…
I'm thinking about selling the house and taking my mom up on her offer.
You and your momma.
Florida?
What are you talking about? You can't move to Florida.
All her friends are here. I'm here. Her world is here.
She needs stability.
She has stability. She got you. She got me.
She got Yogurtworld. Ain't no Yogurtworld in Florida!
Yeah, and she also has a school
that she's not gonna be able to go to unless we pay tuition by Monday.
Then let's pay the tu… Mon--
Monday? Monday, like in seven days?
Yeah, which you would know if you had checked your voice mails.
Is that the stability you talk about?
-How much is it? -Five grand.
Five thousand dollars for a child?
Mm-hmm. And she needs braces.
-What's wrong? -Her teeth are jacked up.
She always says she likes her teeth 'cause they look like my teeth.
That's my point.
Okay. Well, how much are braces? What? Five, six hundred dollars?
-Without insurance, try six grand. -Six grand?
But I did find a guy who quoted me $4,800.
-I know we done been through a whole lot. -Yeah.
Just, please, don't take my daughter away.
Till Monday. Just give me till Monday.
Ten grand. Tuition, teeth, everything.
Okay, fine. I will give you till Monday.
Come on, hug me.
-Hug me. -I'm hugging you.
-Stop listening to your mom. She drinks. -What?
-Uh, Bud. -What?
I have one more question.
Paige said that there's a porn star living in your building?
How does she even know what a porn star is?
It's the Valley, Joss. They live amongst us.
♪ Still gotta pray for the LA, we play Black folks still bring into the true ♪
Fellas. 'Sup, baby?
Who's thirsty? Hmm?
Business is booming, I see.
What's up, Eddie? Oh!
You always fast.
[in Korean] Is Troy here?
-[door buzzes] -[Bud] Troy!
Decided to take me up on my offer?
Not today, not tomorrow, not anytime.
-Here, you thirsty? -Ooh. Thank you!
-Get some of that in you. -Fifteen hundred is good money.
Like I said, Troy, Snake Eyes ain't for sale now.
Everything's for sale. You just have to be desperate enough.
-So, what do you got for Troy? -Desperate, huh? Mm-hmm.
-[rattling] -That's what I got for Troy.
Money. All right.
Right there.
-[Troy] Ooh, nice. -Count that.
Let's see, uh…
-Oh, this is a young male. -Mm-hmm.
Garden-variety, it's like Eastern…
Hey, smoker…
-Nasty habit, don't you think? -Yeah.
He would have died from smoking if he wasn't dead already.
Count the shit up.
Let's check this out. Uh, yeah, you see there?
-Yeah, solid bloodline. -Mm-hmm.
Must've gotten here through Mexico or something.
-He fed recently, you see that? -Yeah.
Okay. Well, how much?
Eight hundred? $800? A piece?
No, both.
Troy, what are you talking about? Look at that again.
-That's worth at least four grand. -Down at the Union.
-Why don't you try the Union? -Come on.
I can't go to the Union. You know that.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I… I forgot you can't go to the Union.
-That's why you're coming to me. Huh? -[table thuds]
And I'm offering you 800 for both.
All right, forget it. Just check the Elder's.
Elder?
That's a different story. That's 20 grand.
[finger snaps] Boom. Perfect. Done.
Yeah, yeah.
If she had been an Elder, which she's not. [laughs]
Check this out.
A decade early and a whole lot of dollars short,
so I can give you like two grand for this.
-Two thousand, Troy? -Mm-hmm. Two thousand?
Listen, I don't think you understand. I need cash today.
Then go and rob a bank or do something. I'm a businessman!
Forget the Elder's. How about this? Silver.
Silver? This is…
-Just gonna put that in your mouth, huh? -This plated shit? Please, Bud.
You wanna make a deal or not?
Shit.
Snake Eyes, 1,500.
Ah, twelve.
You said 1,500 when I walked in here. It is 1,500.
Before I knew you were desperate.
That's everything I have.
Well, I think you have something else.
Are those Jordans?
What size?
Hey. Hey, Pickle. How you doing?
[Paige] Dad, are we moving?
-Are we what? -Are we moving?
No. No. What makes you think that?
Mom says I might have to start a new school.
That's what Mom says, huh?
Well, you know Mom is a jokester, and I love her to death, but…
But we're not going anywhere.
You're not going anywhere, okay?
Okay, good. Thanks, Daddy.
-I love you. -I love you too!
I need you, bro.
[man on phone] We have already agreed to take delivery of the product
and to help with placement in Simi Valley.
You had no authority to take out Sasha.
I'm going to have to rethink our deal.
[Audrey] Sasha is the past, and I am the future.
We already own the night, but my product will allow us to seize the day.
So here is your choice.
You join me, and we take over the Valley, or you can join him. Comprendes?
[in Spanish] My precious…
[in English] It's just one man.
I can still smell him.
Find him.
Big J, you ain't changed a bit, baby. I see you. What's happening?
You know me, cutting necks and cashing checks.
Yeah. Thanks for meeting me, man.
Least I can do for the player that snatched my ass out the sandbox twice.
How's Seeger?
Same.
-Or worse. -Damn.
You think he'll listen?
-Things have changed since you left. -I ain't never left, Big J.
Well, since you got your ass kicked out the Union.
Look here. I'm putting my name and my ass on the line by vouching for you.
Can you play this shit by the books?
I got to. I got to get that Union card, or I'm gonna lose my family.
Look, I need ten large in the next five days,
or Joss is gonna take Paige down to Florida.
That's bad.
The Union is the only place gonna give me that kind of coin.
-I got you. Lock and load. -All right.
She's done this before, man. Pump faking, whatever.
She's done this before, man. Pump faking, whatever. But right now, it seems like it's real.
[in Japanese] Hi, Momoko!
How are you?
Momoko.
[in English] Yes?
Pink penguin puffy pants.
[Bud] See you ain't missed a step, Big J.
[woman on PA] JJ Perry to the trade counter.
-[Bud] Wow. -JJ Perry to the trade counter.
[Bud] I don't know how I feel about this.
Things really done changed around here, huh?
Yeah, we ain't just 818 no more. We done went international.
Look, Paris even blowing up tonight. Hmm.
Bet money's good out there.
Let's go and get this thing over with.
How's the shirt look?
Stop being nervous, man. Pull yourself together.
Hey, Big John.
[John] Well, hello, sunshine.
He's expecting you, but he's in one of his moods today.
I took this meeting out of respect for you, Big John.
God knows I wouldn't be sitting here without your support.
But, uh, I'm certain we all remember
that Mr. Jablonski's previous tenure as a Union member was…
chock-full of incidents.
Let's just take a look.
Northridge, 2014, violated code 103.
Encino, 2015, fleshed out a nest
while a child's birthday party was unfolding next door,
endangering civilians, violating codes 921, 833, and 605,
the worst of which was the failure to notify law enforcement in due time.
-That was a good bust. What happened was-- -And to top it all off…
Canoga Park, 2017,
violated code 101, endangering a fellow Union member's life.
Critical injury sustained.
He already had g… gout. He had gout.
Each of these incidents… meriting a lifelong suspension.
And yet, time and again, you were given warnings.
Why should I extend you yet another lifeline?
Ralph, let me be the first to tell you.
-Bud here, he's a new man. -Yeah.
Is that right?
Yes, sir. Absolutely. I'm a changed man.
I've cut out, uh… pork and cartoons and minimal white women.
Bud, I'm curious. Uh…
If you were in my position, sitting across from a man such as yourself,
would you let you back in?
If that person that is in question admits fault
and be apologetic, which I am, and,
on top of that, I just…
Look, Ralph…
Mr. Seeger, I just…
I really need to get out there. I need to do good.
I promise, if you give me that opportunity, I'm not gonna mess it up.
One last chance.
Now that we, uh, got that part settled,
I'm gonna go freshen up my coffee and let you gentlemen cross those T's.
That's a great guy. Great guy.
Really appreciate this second chance.
I don't know what the hell that man sees in you, Jablonski.
I mean, I know you served together, but, frankly, I don't care.
I've made it my life's work keeping cowboys like you out of the Union,
so I'll be watching you.
[menacingly] ♪ Every step you make ♪
♪ Every shit you take ♪
-♪ Every time you-- ♪ -[John] Everything good?
Quite. [clears throat]
Fill these out, all of them.
Once you pay your initial dues, we'll get you started on the health care plan.
There's dental included, right?
After a probationary period lasting…
30 days.
Come on, man. Three days.
Two weeks.
-One. -[sighs]
Fine.
With a Union rep accompanying him in the field.
-Generous. Thank you. -[Seeger] Great.
All right. Thanks, and, uh… [clears throat] …I want the night shift.
-Not on my life. -[Bud] Come on, Seeger.
-That's where the big money is! -[Seeger] No. Not a chance.
Amount of shit you stirred up working night shift,
you expect me to let you back out there where the sun don't shine?
Fine.
Day shift.
Good. Anything else?
No.
Oh, yeah. I got some, uh, teeth I need to sell.
Go to the cage.
Seeger, thank you kindly.
And remember, Bud,
one last strike.
Is… Are you referring to bowling, because…
-I'm saying there's a strike in bowl-- -You're back. That's all that matters.
Carol.
Carol, did you eat my yogurt again?
I even wrote my name on the lid today,
so you literally had to peel back my name to get to the yogurt.
Oh, what? You can't hear me?
I'm gonna fart in my yogurt, and you're gonna eat my fart.
Next.
Mr. Jablonski?
Yeah. Teeth.
So I look at it like this. I get back out there, do what I gotta do,
you know, for Mr. Mullet.
This is chipped, female.
Appears to be an almost Elder, roughly 90 years old.
Ninety? You probably need to check that again.
-You sure it's 90? -I'm sure.
Okay, whatever.
Full price still, right?
I'm sorry. Code 107 in the book clearly states anything--
Enough of the codes. It's fine.
-That's the net for the teeth. -Yeah, I'll come in… Hey!
However, due to the truncated processing time,
Mr. Seeger would like me to inform you we need your dues up front,
which, of course, is $5,000.
$5,000? I thought it was two?
Those are 2017 rates, Mr. Jablonski.
Then there is 15% off the top of every fang,
and we have to hold 50% until we receive your paperwork.
And, of course, $10 for your membership card,
which gets you one free app at Cheesecake Factory.
-I don't like cheesecake. -Do you have that?
Why won't you take the $10 out of that? Taking everything else.
You don't have cash on you? You really wanna make me split this?
Okay, you are good to go.
Am I?
If you have any issues with this,
Carol right here would be happy to further assist you.
Oh, great. I see you met your Union rep.
What?
[John] Come on, Bud.
Sir, please.
That new girl's a smoke show.
Right, but I'm begging you to reconsider. I'm not meant for the field.
I just bought an ergonomic chair with my own money. I'm all in on the desk.
That's why I need you out there with him. Right? Someone who knows the codes to the letter.
-Okay, but-- -Hey, hey, hey.
Do you wanna move up here?
You gotta get your ass out in the field. All right?
Think about it this way, you're gonna be my eyes and ears, my friend.
-Right? -Right--
And the minute he messes up, the minute he goes against code,
you'll be there reporting it back to me, right?
The sooner he fucks up, the sooner your sweet cheeks are in Carol's desk.
You work out?
-A little. -Yeah, thought so.
You're late.
Close it.
I was actually here an hour ago, but you weren't, so I went to go get us breakfast.
I got you an organic, gluten-free, paleo bran muffin.
Really? Thank you.
-I was starving. -That was a six-dollar muffin.
-What do you have on? -What?
-What are you wearing? -Just, like, normal clothes.
The handbook says blend in on the hunt. Be inconspicuous.
You have on a suit. How's that inconspicuous?
You have on a suit. We're in the Valley. In the summertime.
-It's a summery suit. -A summery suit?
-Juniper green. Yes. -What is juniper green?
A hue of green I found to be complementary against my skin tone.
Whatever it is, don't wear it again.
Look, I'll put myself together, and we'll take off, all right?
-Do you have somewhere I can hang this? -Yep.
Not there.
I'll just… hold on to it.
This ain't gonna last.
Got enough weapons and ammo in here to take down El Jefe, huh?
[chuckles] What you know about El Jefe?
Oh, come on. Legendary 700-year-old European vampire.
Some say he's at the top of the LA drug trade, just waiting for his moment to reemerge.
Fangs so sharp, with just one, you could buy a mansion in Bel Air. Hmm.
You sound like Big John.
Whole lot of gibberish. You know that's a crock of shit, right?
I didn't take you for an arts and crafts guy. -What are these all about? -Wanna keep your hands off my shit?
-What are these all about? -Wanna keep your hands off my shit?
It's my trophy case.
For each one that I kill, I, uh… They're already dead, but you get my drift.
'Cause they're allergic to wood. Smart.
They're allergic to wood, but not just any wood. It's mpingo wood.
The strongest African hardwood. Not that Ikea shit.
We mix it with the garlic. The wooden bullets pierce the heart.
-The silver-- -Silver to the throat. Right.
Yeah. Cuts the head off… usually.
Usually. Right, you are referring to Uber Vamps,
who have come back from decapitation.
[Bud] Not if you blast the heart with wood before you cut their throats with silver.
Mm-hmm. You also forgot to mention that you can kill them by burning them.
I didn't forget anything. That's how I get my money.
Why would I burn the fangs? I don't do that.
Listen, Guacamole Suit,
right there on the shelf, grab that for me.
Get that, we'll take off.
And remember, whatever you do, don't… drop my shit.
So, uh, where we going?
I'm going hunting. I don't know about you.
Why you wearing the seat belt like that?
Um, yeah, I mean, usually the seat belts aren't like this complicated and heavy. But--
It's not complicated. It's just a seat belt. It protects you.
Sure.
Sure. It's still protecting me though. If anything happened, it's just--
See? It still catches me.
I see.
It's gonna be a long day.
So, are you gonna tell me what we're doing at an animal shelter?
I'm gonna tell you shit.
What you know about Juvies?
Juvies or Juveniles, AKA Zombie Vamps,
formed when an already young vamp turns somebody else.
Instead of the strength of a full vamp,
they lack regenerative abilities and appear more dead than alive.
They can't process human blood yet, so what do they do?
-I'm aware. -They feed off of small animals, rodents.
So you've read the book?
I don't have to read it. I'm out here.
What do you know about different species of vampires?
I know there are five types. Southern, Eastern, Spider, Uber, and Juvenile.
They are largely solitary, but when together, there is a hierarchy.
They organize by age. What else?
The sunlight is the only thing they're scared of.
They can't reproduce, but they can turn people. Should I continue?
-What about familiars? -You think this guy's one of them?
I don't know. You tell me.
-Hmm? -I think he fits the profile.
-You think so? -Absolutely.
More powerful vamps have more powerful familiars.
And when it comes to Juvies, a little kid like this,
he's probably grabbing those cats for 'em, try to get 'em turned.
-Oh man. -What?
No, I'm just a big cat lover. I got two of them myself.
Oh. Okay. Well, that explains it.
-Want to see a picture? -No, I don't.
Maybe later.
All right. Here we go.
[Bud] There's his car.
Canoga Bowl. Closed for 18 months.
It's perfect.
-Can I offer some advice? -No.
I mean, economically speaking, why go after Juvies?
Why not let them ripen, come back when their teeth are valuable?
I could come back in September, but right now, I'm out of time.
And beggars can't be choosers.
Plus, you don't want these things biting people, do you?
Wait. Why don't you have time?
-Why you ask me so many questions? -I'm just--
Just stay in the truck and do your business.
Stay in the truck? No, I have to be with you at all times in the field.
-Union rules. -Other than keeping you alive,
-Union rules. -Other than keeping you alive, I don't give a shit about rules.
No, no, you don't understand. All times.
You're gonna stay in this car. With that in mind, here.
-What? No, I don't believe in guns. -You don't believe in 'em?
No, they're amoral. They're killing machines. They're not for me.
When I was a kid, I tried shooting a squirrel with a BB gun,
and I just couldn't. All right?
I still have nightmares where I can see his little face
making little squirrel noises, and I still have nightmares about it.
Made squirrel noises, huh?
-What does a squirrel noise sound like? -It's like…
Whatever! I don't wanna talk about it.
Stay in the truck.
It's impossible.
How the hell can you be here? It's daytime.
You've been a bad boy, Troy.
Did you know that a vampire cannot live without its fangs?
And yet, for whatever reason, whatever cruel joke from the gods…
they are the one thing we cannot regenerate.
Everything that makes a vampire a predator
is in its fangs.
Each set is a life that could have lived a thousand lives.
Lives that you had a part in ending.
Yet it wasn't always like this, you know?
There was a time when you humans, you worshiped us as gods.
Right here in this valley, you built temples of blood and bone to honor us.
And then you turned on us.
Well, guess what?
I'm gonna take back what's ours,
one property at a time.
The way I see it, you have two choices, two doors.
One, you bend the knee and join me in service, and you live.
And two…
you don't.
All right. So, what the hell do you want? Huh?
Who brought you this tooth?
A name.
You're so full of shit, lady.
You think you're a god?
You're not gods. You're a big mistake.
You're a genetic mutation that would've died out
if there hadn't been a stinking hole for y'all to crawl into.
Door number two it is.
No. No! [echoing] No!
Time for the tooth fairy.
Hello, sir.
How are we on this fine morning?
Any violations to report?
He is certainly heading that way,
but nothing verified quite yet.
Well, where is he now?
He left me in the car and went into a bowling alley.
You didn't follow him?
I thought he was gonna shoot me! He's very difficult to reason with, sir.
Kid! You want your promotion?
You want Carol's desk?
Then get off your ass, get in there, and verify those violations.
Ugh! Hair on your nipples!
-[Seth] Bud? -Seth!
-Seth! -Shit.
-Bud! -[Bud] Hurry up! Shoot it!
I… I don't have my gun!
-Give me my shotgun! -[snarling]
I'm… I'm just an observer!
Your gonna be hors d'œuvre if you don't give me that gun!
Shit! Shit! Shit!
Whoa! I'm sorry!
Next time I tell you, "Gimme that goddamn gun," you gimme that goddamn gun!
-Now duck! -What?
I said duck!
You okay?
Oh, jeez. That was horrible.
These Juvie teeth ain't worth shit, but get enough of 'em…
It's a number game like you said. Uh, you okay?
What's going on?
Oh, come on. No, no, I'm not okay.
-All right? Look at me! -What?
Vampires just tried to kill me.
You put a gun in my face, and now I just pissed my favorite fucking suit!
Hey, hey. Relax. You did good in there. You did good in there.
Besides, everybody pisses themselves the first time.
-Really? -Yeah.
-Did you? -No, I… No, I didn't. But listen, you did.
Here, dry your eyes. Dry your eyes, okay.
You know what?
Put it on me. My bad. We bit off more than we could chew today.
So why don't we go home, get some rest.
In the morning, we'll kick some motherfucking ass. Okay?
-Okay. -All right, come on.
Let's get in the car.
What the fuck is that? What'd you eat today?
You know what?
Let's have you get in the back. Don't want you to get that on my vintage seats.
-What, are you serious? -Damn right.
Come on. Gotta move.
Hang your leg out the back so we can air dry.
[Bud] Hey. Hey!
-You forgot your man-purse. -Wait. That's expens--
You gotta get some of this too.
I'm sure you know, Mr. Union Man. But when vamps are killed,
they release a gas that gets on you that other vamps can sniff out.
So you gotta get all of that off. Here, take this.
It's my special blend, like a little, uh, skunk musk, okay?
-Now, get that on you, in the shower. -Oh Jesus.
-Now, get that on you, in the shower. -Oh Jesus. On every inch of you, okay?
Be extremely careful. Don't get it in your eyes.
And whatever you do,
don't get it in your butthole. What happens in the butthole?
I mean, it can't kill you, but… Jesus Christ.
By the way, lock your doors, don't come out after dark, and, uh…
-Guess what? -What?
You're dried up.
Oh!
-[chuckles] Oh God. It's okay. -I'm sorry about that.
-No, no, me. I got it. -It's okay.
It's my fault. I couldn't see over my baskets.
I got it. This is a… You a… you a doctor?
Uh, nurse, actually.
Hope you don't think this is weird, but you got a lot of scrubs.
Yeah, I mean, I hate doing laundry, so I kind of just kept buying new ones.
-Got out of control. -Okay.
But, hey, new apartment. Why not start off on the right foot?
Yeah. Well, welcome to the building. I'm right there in 20.
-Oh! Well, I'm Heather. I'm in 19. -Well, I'm Bud 20. [chuckles]
Can you help me with that, actually?
[Bud] Oh. Yeah.
-[Heather] Thanks. -Yeah, no problem.
-You can just put that down anywhere. -Sure. Okay.
-See you've got a retro vibe poppin', huh? -Mm-hmm.
-Dig that. -Thanks.
I wish I had a beer or something to offer you.
Uh, a previous tenant left some ice cream in the freezer, if you're interested.
No, thanks. I'll take a rain check.
-You sure? -Yeah. Welcome to the building.
Thank you.
Feeling better?
Not really.
Got a little bit of that yellow stuff in my butthole.
It was so much worse than what you even described.
Bet it was.
You looking for something?
-Whoa. Hey, that's personal. -No, no, no.
"Violation code 101, terminated vamps and didn't report to the Union."
"Violation code 276, breaking and entering without Union sanctions."
-That did happen. -Violation. Violation. Violation.
Oh, look at this. "Needs to reimburse me for six-dollar muffin"?
It's a standard part of Union procedure.
-I have to document everything. -It's not.
It's for Seeger to keep me out the Union. Ain't that great?
You almost got me killed yesterday.
You almost got yourself killed yesterday.
I told you stay your punk-ass in the car. That's why I work by myself.
Listen. What? You're gonna die in the name of kissing your boss's ass?
Well, he didn't give me a choice, okay?
Listen to me, Mr. Union Fellow.
I may not follow all the Union rules, but let me tell you something.
If we went by the book, we'd both be dead by now!
And you saw that yesterday.
Look. Just give me a couple of days.
Okay, a couple days.
So, what's on the agenda today?
Like every day.
Hunting vampires.
[Seth] Bud, what are we doing at a pawn shop?
[Bud] This dude's cheap as shit, but he got goods we need in order to, uh…
What the hell?
Oh Jesus.
[whispers] Shut up. Shut up.
Hey, hey.
Don't you puke in here! Don't touch nothing. Don't leave your DNA.
I swallowed it.
Troy.
Troy?
Damn it.
Wait, is that…
It was.
[Seth] Oh no.
Who… who does that?
All right, we gotta move.
Wait a minute. Take this.
Are you kidding me?
-It's not right, okay. Wait-- -Damn right. How you think he feels, huh?
Come on, let's go.
Wait. You can't leave. That's against protocol.
We have to call the Union and wait for them.
-Code 233 says any hunter who encounters… -Code? I don't give a shit.
…suspicious civilian death will be under a 30-day suspension--
We don't have 30 days. I don't give fuck!
We gotta leave. There's other vamps around here. Let's go.
No, no. I'm calling.
Whoa! We have dead humans here. We have to report this.
That ain't no dead human! That's my friend!
Listen, I'm not telling you you cannot report it.
I'm just telling you to delay it.
We'll make an anonymous call to the cops, and, after 24 hours,
you can make your funky little report. Let's go!
Why do you care? What difference does a day make?
I'm gonna lose my family in a day! That's the difference!
What?
Look, if I don't score some prices at Union wages by Monday,
my wife and my daughter move to Florida.
That means, if you call Seeger, I'm gonna lose my family.
I'm… I'm sorry.
Yeah, I bet you are.
So what you're saying is you… you kinda need me.
But… No, I didn't… I didn't say I need you. I didn't say that.
-No, I just mean… -I didn't say that.
You told me your secrets. I'm gonna break protocol for you.
-So we're like a team, partners, whatever. -I didn't say partners.
-Crockett and Tubbs. -No.
-Any partnership you find satisfactory. -Listen.
What I'm saying is this, is as a man, just give me till the weekend.
Yeah, okay. Until the weekend.
Yeah.
[Heather] Look. What do you want me to do? If I keep… he's gonna suspect something.
Just relax.
[Bud] I got a tip on this house from Big J.
Why don't you check the glove box right now?
Yeah.
That's what we're doing right there.
That's what we doing.
These… garlic grenades.
Pull the pin, garlic and sawdust comes out, clears the room.
I think. Haven't actually had to use it.
But, in theory, that's what's gonna happen.
An unproven weapon for my first real vampire fight.
-That's wonderful. Thank you. -Shit. Shit!
What? What?
Goddamn Nazarian Brothers.
Wait, the Nazarian brothers. Oh, they're big-time hunters.
Yeah, not bigger than me though.
They cleared out all of Glendale. Now they're headed west.
-Hey, Bud. -[music stops]
I thought I smelled chlorine.
[sniffing] Funny. Thought I smelled shit.
-Who's the cupcake? -[Seth] Seth.
I'm his Union rep. But you can call me Cupcake or whatever you prefer.
-I'm a big fan, by the way. -Want to get a selfie for your Instagram?
What you guys doing in Simi Valley?
You know what we're doing here, bro.
We let you do the hard part for us,
figure out which house is hiding the goods, then, you know.
You got me twisted. I did the work, but I ain't do it for you.
Oh, come on, Bud. Think about it.
Waste a week waiting for the right moment that we just might take from you?
Or we run up there in force right now.
Sack the place together. Split the money down the middle.
Well, one, ain't nobody taking shit from me.
And two…
Yeah. It's a good idea.
-[techno music resumes] -Wanna get a selfie?
Right now? Is that appropriate?
-We can wait-- -That's not appropriate at all.
-What's this? -Keep your neck from getting chewed out.
Take this. Stay behind me. I keep you alive.
Don't shoot where they are. Shoot where they're gonna be.
You ready? Let's go.
♪ Ooh, baby, I like it raw Yeah, baby, I like it raw ♪
What's the garlic for?
Any vamp gets close to me, I spit in their eye,
melt hole in their fucking head.
Bro, you got any more gum?
-You always share that with your brother? -We share everything.
D, you're supposed to pry that shit open, not smash it.
Hey. Are we inside the house or not, bro?
Don't even think about it.
-[shotgun cocks] -Got him.
Nice shot, bro. Time to get paid.
Open up.
I told him not to do it.
-Really? -I'm sorry.
-Put that gun down. -Okay.
-Take your finger off the trigger. -Right. Okay.
Just watch my six. Six… Uh…
-It's a hive. -What?
Showtime, bro.
Head on out.
Bitch-ass.
Keep your head on a swivel, all right? And stay away from the walls.
-Oh shit! Bud! -[grunts]
Bud! I don't… What do I do?
Ah! You gotta stop wiggling!
Oh no!
No!
-[clicking] -Oh shit! The gun's broken!
-[Bud] Take the safety off! -Help, Bud! My gun's not working.
[Seth yelling] Oh, come on!
Oh God!
Buckshot mouthwash, baby.
Nice, bro. Yes.
I got six.
You got six. I got five. I'll catch you up.
Oh shit! Bud, help me!
-[snarls] -Wait, hold up! Wait, hold on! Ah!
[Bud] Don't let it bite you, Seth!
Haircut time, bro.
I'm out!
Bud, help me! Bud, help!
This motherfucker threw me up the stairs?
Bro, send one!
[Seth yelling] No good!
Nice work, bro.
Help! Help me!
-[vampire snarling] -Seth, my shotgun!
-Big money, baby. -Huh? This is what I was talking about.
-This was good, yes? -Very good.
What happened to you? You piss your pants?
It's kinda my thing.
-Bro. -What you doing? What're you doing?
Listen, pee-pee pants, this is man's world, not little boy.
Gonna get you a Pamper. Anyway, listen. Be safe, man. Okay?
I'mma take this and put it towards my baby girl's tuition, you know?
That's why I'm out here. You know…
Familiar on the run.
I got it.
-He's up again. That was vampire. -I know.
Streets done changed. I hear they got this sunscreen that they put on.
It's real thick, and they can now last out in the sunlight like 15, 20 minutes.
You know it's made from the shell of desert tortoise.
It's illegal in 40 countries, right, bro?
Vampire sunscreen? The Valley? I don't like the sound of this.
-Hey, wait, this doesn't make sense. -'Sup?
Okay, that's a Spider, but that's an Uber.
Those are Southerns, and…
Yeah, that's an Eastern. You can tell by his fangs in the front.
Ain't Bloods and Crips. It's the Valley. They cross-pollinate.
No, these vamps would never choose to live together.
Ubers are solo-nesters.
Spiders cohabitate, but never with Easterns and Southerns.
-They'd steal their food. -[Diran] Listen to this kid. Huh?
This joker reads a few books, he thinks he knows more than the pros.
No, no, wait, wait, wait. Kid makes a good point.
-But… -[watch beeps]
But I'm outta time. I gotta go pick up the little one. Come on.
Pull these fangs. And why don't you go to the bathroom and dry off your dick.
You okay?
I don't know.
I just keep thinking about how all those vampires we just killed
used to be regular people.
[chuckles] There you go.
The old vampires-are-just-like-us routine.
But they're not, Seth.
You know what I see when I see a vamp? Big old dollar signs.
'Cause all they are is murderers and liars.
It ain't Brad Pitt in a leather jacket and some blood raves.
It's not Eclipse. It's not New Moon. It's not Breaking Dawn Part One.
It ain't like that, all right?
Why do you know the names to all the specific Twilight films?
What's your gripe with Breaking Dawn Part 2?
It's the exciting conclusion of the whole Twilight Saga.
Wha… Have you seen Part 2?
Bella has her baby now. It's insane.
-She had the baby? -Oh, I wish I was you!
To experience that the first time. You're in for a treat.
My daughter hipped me to all that. I don't really get into all that.
But you got something different, Seth.
You're tougher than you think you are.
No.
I'm serious.
You're just saying that so I don't report you to Seeger.
No, I'm not. You got what it takes. I'm telling you. You have that instinct.
You could be a real hunter out here.
Telling you right now.
Fuck Carol.
Fuck accounting.
You could do this.
-Hey. Hey! -Hi, Dad!
-Dad? What happened to "Daddy"? -Little kids say, "Daddy."
Oh, is that right? "Dad," huh?
Everything's changing around here.
You're late. Again.
So, what is all this?
Well, I can't actually sell the house without putting it on the market.
Yeah. Last I checked, it's three days until Monday.
Come on, Dad. We're gonna be late to the party.
You know, I was thinking, what if we don't go?
What if we stay here at the house and eat pizza, some ice cream--
Bud. No. She's been talking about this all week. You promised.
Yeah, well, I just didn't think it was the right time right now.
What? Okay, give me a reason why.
Right. So, Daddy was just kidding. He was just being weird.
-[Bud] Yeah. -Yeah, you guys are going to a party!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. -See, Daddy was just being strange.
-Strange, yeah. -Yeah.
-Come on. -Bye.
-Bye, baby. -Bye.
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday… ♪
-Cake time, baby. I'll check on the kids. -All right.
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
Hello?
[Audrey] I've been looking for you, Bud.
Who is this?
Troy spoke so highly of you.
Your name was the last thing on his lips when he died.
You know how this ends, don't you?
You tell me.
With you on your knees in front of me,
begging for the lives of your wife and your daughter.
You took something from me, and now I'm gonna take everything from you.
Enjoy the party.
-Yay! -[all cheering] [Bud] Aw. Nice. Ha ha. That's so nice. We gotta go, baby. That's so nice.
We gotta go, baby. That's so nice. -Happy birthday. -Bye, Paige.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Up, up, up.
Look, buckle yourself in, okay?
Look, in here, all right. Now let's put your headphones on, okay?
Got your iPad right here. Now listen. Dad's gonna be driving.
You might feel a little swerving, but that's just my special driving.
Just pick up, pick up, pick up.
[Joss] Can't talk. Meeting a realtor.
-Don't hang up! -Why? Is Paige okay?
-Uh, yeah, she's great, but, uh… -[game chimes]
Look, Joss, we're in trouble, okay? All of us.
What? What are you talking about? There's a lot I need to tell you.
I know you've had trouble trusting me in the past.
I know you think I keep things from you, but right now, you gotta trust me.
-I don't want to lose either of you. -Now you're freaking me out.
Pack your bags, be ready to go, and I will explain everything, okay?
-A bag? -[hangs up]
All right.
Hey. You took your headphones off, huh?
I already won my race. Besides, looks like you can use my help.
Uh, you're not wrong on that.
Light!
Car!
Thank you!
All right, big jump. Big jump!
There's a guy on the right!
[Bud] Hold on.
Cover your ears, sweetie.
[Paige] That was awesome.
[Bud] Yeah? Just don't tell your mother.
Come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on. All right. Come on. Let's run.
Come on. All right. Come on. Let's run.
-You ever heard of Jackie Joyner-Kersee? -Uh, no.
-I'll show her to you. -Okay.
-[screams] -No! No! No!
No!
[Joss] No, no, no! Stop!
[Audrey] Hola, Bud.
I told you you'd be on your knees begging for their lives.
It's okay. It's okay.
So beg.
-Go to hell. -Oh, your compadre said the same thing.
Oh shit. Baby, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for this, Joss. Are you okay?
Yeah.
What is happening, Bud?
I could try to explain it right now, but it's not gonna make any sense.
-But-- -But what?
I'm not exactly a pool cleaner.
Well, then, what are you?
I…
hunt vampires.
-What? -[Bud] Yeah. I hunt vampires.
-Vampires? -Yeah. That's what I do.
-Vampires? -[Bud] Yeah.
Okay, so all of the lies, all of the late-night calls, all of the locks…
Come on, man.
The reason I'm separated from the man I love is vampires? Ow!
Stop choking her like that!
Come on, Bud. We said we were gonna be honest with each other.
We are.
-[Bud] I know. Don't look at it. -Oh my God! -[Bud] Listen… -[hissing]
I wanted to tell you. I just didn't know how.
Okay. Okay, so…
Uh, what do you want?
What do I want?
You and your daughter.
-They're not a part of this! -Pendejo, you made them a part of it!
-Don't touch me! -Don't touch her!
I'm not afraid of you.
[gasps] Such a brave muñeca.
Take them.
-No! No! -No, don't touch her!
-Leave her alone! Get your hands off her! -Don't touch her!
[Bud grunts] I'll come get you! -[Paige] Daddy! -[Joss groans]
-I'mma fix all of this. I love y'all! -[Audrey] Cálmate, Bud.
A new day is dawning, and your little girl's gonna be a part of it.
[Audrey] First, I'm gonna turn her, and then I'm gonna watch as she drinks your wife.
[sighs] I wish you could be there to see it,
but I'm afraid someone's having you for dinner.
[Paige in English] Daddy!
Oh, I'm alive.
Oh, Bud.
Oh, I feel weird.
Yeah, I bet… I bet you do.
What happened to me?
Just some bullshit. You know how shit go.
But, uh…
-[groans] -You probably wanna… check your teeth.
Check my teeth?
Yeah, just check them. There's a mirror over there. Oh…
Oh! Oh no!
Oh no. Oh, that's not good.
-What! That was totally involuntary. -It's like a hiccup, probably.
-[gasps] -I'm sorry, man, it was all my fault.
How you feel?
Pretty horrified about the fact that I'm a vampire.
-Right. Right. -But also like…
-I don't know, kind of amazing. -Yeah, like--
Like my blood, it just… it feels like it's on fire--
Like you had, like, a lot of energy drinks.
[sniffs] Oh, I can smell everything!
Oh God, did I shit myself this time?
No, no, no, you look fine.
-Is there like a mark? -No, you look good.
Everything looks great.
Listen, let's just take it easy.
-We're gonna work this out. -[stomach rumbling] Oh wow.
Mainly I just… Whoa, I just feel
hungry!
Goddamn it, Seth.
I'm sorry, kid.
I'm actually gonna miss you, man, you know?
It's crazy how you get attached to someone.
Oh shit.
Bud?
You cut my head off. I thought we were friends.
I… You rushed me.
It's just reaction. That's what I do.
It's in my blood. It's like… You ever see Tyson? He…
You don't walk up on Tyson either.
Friendship is complicated, huh?
Yeah, friendships are complicated.
All right, wait. Follow my voice. Left, there. Yep, okay.
Easy. No. Okay, easy, easy.
[groaning] Okay, here we go.
The fuck?
Okay, gentle. Gentle. [exhales]
Huh. Still fits.
Wha…
Oh, it's been quite the week.
Yeah, it has. You good?
-How do I look? -You look all right.
-You feel all right? -You swear?
-Yeah. -[hisses]
-Hey! -Sorry. Just kidding.
-Okay. All right. -Too soon. Too soon. All right.
Hey, I'm sorry I tried to eat you.
How 'bout we not report this to Seeger until Monday?
Seeger, shit. Oh, what? You don't think he's gonna notice?
What, am I just supposed to wear turtlenecks from now on?
I mean, I do look good in a T-neck, but that's not sustainable.
-Wait. Where are we going? -Going to get my family back.
I have to stop at my place and get some information.
What's going on with your neck? Is it repairing itself?
I actually think it is.
Okay, just be careful. Don't go over any speed bumps.
Damn. Damn.
My bad.
[Seth] You have a driving problem. You know that, right?
I gotta go to apartment 19.
I'll be back in five.
Heather, you just moved in. Leaving so soon?
Bud, just listen to me.
Look, we need to talk.
Talk? Vampires kidnapped my family. You wanna talk?
-I didn't have a choice. -I don't give a rat's ass.
This is stupid, Bud. Let me at least explain.
Okay, listen.
Because of you, my family got kidnapped, and my friend is dead.
Or undead.
So I don't want no problems, I just…
That's what she does, Bud.
-[groans] -She turns people against their will.
I wasn't even a familiar. She just… just did this to me.
You think I wanna work for a monster like her?
Then why do you?
-She's my maker, okay? -What?
And an Uber Vamp.
Look, she forced me to get close to you.
She wanted to get back at you for what you did to her. What you talking about?
She just… She just wanted to know how to hurt you.
Why?
So, you just gonna light your finger on fire, huh?
You killed a vampire Monday, didn't you?
-Sweet old lady? -Not so sweet, actually.
That was Audrey's daughter.
Daughter? How?
When she came over, she had a little girl she had to leave behind.
So by the time they went back, found her, and turned her, she was old.
-And I killed her. -And you killed her.
And now they got Paige and Jocelyn.
I'm sorry.
-[door slams] -Hey, Bud. I don't feel so good.
[moans] Could you hold my head for a little?
Holy shit.
You're walking on sacred ground. You should be honored.
Where are you taking us?
-Why, are you frightened? -No.
You should be.
Well, then you don't know me that well, bitch. Ah!
Why are you doing this?
Paige, don't talk to her.
She has a right to know.
You don't get to decide-- [gasps]
I had a daughter once, feisty like you.
I wanted to make a better world for her.
A world where she could be free from hiding.
But your father took that away from me.
Now, you see, it's only fair I take you away from him.
-If you hurt her, I'll kill you. -[snarls]
But I'm already dead.
I'm not gonna hurt her, Ms. Jablonski.
I'm gonna make sure no one can ever hurt her again.
-You should thank me. -[gasping]
A war is coming,
and your little girl's gonna be on the winning side.
-[Paige] No! -Paige!
[Paige] Let me go!
No. No!
-[Joss grunts] -Come on.
-[squelching] -[Bud] Seth, hold your head still.
Looks like they've turned him with Uber blood, so he'll be unpredictable for a while.
He'll get under control eventually.
[Bud] Here.
[moans] No, I'm pescatarian.
Come on.
-[groans] Mm. Mmm! -[Bud] There we go.
You hunters are always complaining about LA running dry.
That's what Audrey's trying to change.
It's, like, sweet but a little tangy.
That's nice. [burps] Oh yeah, get inside of me.
She uses her cover as a realtor to buy properties all over the Valley
and move vamps back in amongst the rest of us.
Within a year, all vamp activity in LA
will be traceable to her sitting at the top.
Not if I get to her first.
I'll lead the way.
-All right, I'm coming too. -No, no, no. No. Hell no, Seth.
You got too much energy now. You fresh off some blood.
I don't want you to switch up on me, try to bite my kidneys out.
No, Bud, listen. They tortured me.
Okay, they drank my blood. They cut my head off.
I guess technically, you cut my head off, but they turned me into this, okay?
-I want to help take her down. -Okay.
We'll get you changed, head back to my spot, and we'll gear up.
-Oh, right now? -Yeah, right now.
What? It's dark out. That's a suicide mission.
Welcome to the motherfucking night shift.
[Seth] Oh shit!
-Ah! Oh, they got me! -[Heather] Look, Seth, calm down!
They're expecting humans. It's lead. It can't hurt you.
-Really? -Yes. But, hey, let it make you mad.
[Bud] You okay?
This one actually hurts. Shit. Ah! Ah!
[Seth] Bud, what do we do? We're surrounded.
Black Cowboy.
Get down.
How the hell you get here?
[John] The snowflake.
I might have texted him.
-Welcome to the fucking Union, brother. -Thank you.
-Hey, hey, if you don't get your ass off-- -Oh. Sorry.
-This way. -Sorry.
[Bud] Come on, Big J.
After you.
Bud, in the back, look for the staircase. That's the entrance to her tunnel.
Keep going down, and you'll find her.
There's a faster way down, but you wouldn't survive it.
We survive everything. See me fighting a bear, you pour honey on me.
You two go ahead. We'll catch up.
Come on. Let's get cracking.
Just like old times.
[John] I'm out.
Look at this shit here. Jackpot.
[John] Man, look at all this gear.
Okay.
Ugh. Shit, look at this. All this sunscreen.
Vamps runnin' around in the day. She could take over the Valley.
[Bud] Handle him, J!
Okay.
-Oh shit. -[grunts]
I see you. He didn't know, did he?
He didn't know.
-[man grunts] -[Bud] Whoo! Get him, J.
[John] Stay down, fool.
Yo. You did that without even stretching, huh?
That was my weak leg.
See all this? Huh?
All these guns?
[John] Check it out. Silver-tipped wooden bullets. Vampire killers.
What's that about?
Is she El Jefe?
Nah. El Jefe is bigger than this, brother.
But, either way, that bitch got an ass-whooping coming.
Yeah.
Yeah, they down here.
Let's get cracking.
[John] Just like old times.
[distorted voice] He's coming.
I can smell him.
I don't know how all this works, but I know my husband,
and he's gonna murder you.
-Ex-husband. -See, now you're just being a bitch.
[in Spanish] Bring him to me.
[in English] Paige.
-This place ain't creepy at all. -[Bud] Tell me about it.
Here we go.
Bud!
[Audrey] Jablonski…
[grunts] John!
[Bud] That's how we do, baby.
You know how we do. We bag 'em, and we tag 'em.
That's how we get it done.
-[John groans] -What's going on with you?
Ain't nothing going on. Ain't nothing wrong with me, man.
-You all right? -Shit. You know they can't fuck with me.
Okay, but why you leaning like that?
We been battle-tested. This don't mean nothing.
-All right. -Nothing but a flesh wound, dog.
Okay. Still, it don't look too good. Come on, let's get up out of here.
Come on. We ain't got much time. Gotta get you out of here. Come on, man.
-Big John, what the hell is you doing? -I'm saving your Black ass.
-Big John, what the hell is you doing? -I'm saving your Black ass. What are you talking about?
Go get your family right now. I got this.
-We can't do it like this. -You know I work alone.
-You crazy motherfucker. -Go.
-You better stay alive. -Go!
I'll be here waiting for you!
All right, motherfuckers, come on!
West side for life!
John…
I'm not supposed to kill you yet, but you've been a real pain in the ass,
so give me one good reason.
Burn in hell.
Good enough.
-You're working on that landing, huh? -No, I planned it like that.
Go, we've got him.
-[gasping] -[Paige] No!
[Bud] Paige! Stay back.
Daddy!
-Joss, you okay? -[moans] Yeah.
All right. I'll let you go.
A life for a life or whatever the hell you have.
You took my daughter, Jablonski.
-I'm just returning the favor. -No.
-[Paige] Mommy! -Baby!
What do you think, muñeca?
I'm gonna kill your daddy, then I'm gonna make you drink your mean old mommy,
and then I'm gonna be your new, improved mommy.
-How does that sound? -[Joss moans]
I hate you!
That's not very nice.
I hate you too.
Daddy!
I should've just got another job.
-Baby, get up! -Come on, Daddy, get up!
Baby, I'm trying.
-[Paige] Try harder. -Oh, okay.
[in Spanish] In the end, the devil comes for everyone.
[in English] That's what you get.
[in Spanish] Bitch.
[in English] No!
Mommy!
Pull!
Wood to the heart, silver to the neck.
[in Spanish] Your last bullet, cabrón?
[in English] No!
[in Spanish] Fucking pool boy.
[in English] The best.
Y'all good?
Works every time.
Let's go.
Come on, babe. Let's go.
All right.
-Hey. Where's Seth? -Hey.
-Whoa! -No, no, no. Babe, babe, no.
They're the good vampires.
That's my girl Heather. That's my guy Seth.
-Hey. -Hey.
Whose arm is that?
Oh. Sorry.
But, Bud… got my first pair of fangs.
That's big money right there.
-Guess what? -What's that?
I didn't pee myself this time.
-Get out. -Vampires don't pee or poop.
Nah, they don't.
-Please let me have this little victory. -Of course you can. C'mon. Let's go.
Do they really not pee or poop?
-Does that mean they're full of shit? -[Bud] Language!
[Bud] Big John.
I'll miss you, baby.
Oh, no.
It's got good energy in that.
All right.
We were hiding right over there. Right over there.
Jablonski!
Seeger? What the hell you doing, walking all fast like that?
New shoe boots on.
And you. What are you, sick?
-Uh, pink eye. -What?
It's when poo particles get in your eye.
Where's Big John?
Oh goddamn it!
I did you a solid.
But now you have graciously returned the favor
because after the shit you pulled here tonight,
I'll never have to deal with you again.
For starters,
flagrantly violating code 682, operating outside of your shift.
Actually, sir, if I may.
Code 741 states that, "If a hunter is in a 911 situation,
he may circumvent normal operating hours
so long as he notifies the Union before entering," which he did.
Thank you. Thank you for that.
There's also code 584, unlawful termination of familiars
without prior authorization.
Yes, sir, that is correct, but Section 4 states,
"When fired on, a hunter is lawfully allowed to return fire,"
which is what happened here.
Code 424, "A Union hunter must make all reasonable efforts
to limit collateral damage to property while engaging in a hunt."
Boom!
-Sir, code 42-- -I got this.
Code 424 was rescinded by the national office in January.
Boom. Boom.
-Someone's been reading. -Saw it in the newsletter.
Yeah. I see what's going on here.
Loopholes.
Think you're smarter than me?
Then you can probably spell "traitor."
Sure.
T-R-A-I-T-O-R. What was the point of that?
Carol's keeping her fucking desk.
Good! She can have it.
I'm a field man now! Mowing down vamps with my best friend Bud.
-That felt good. [laughs] -You did that.
Wait. Shit. What are you gonna do about the money?
-Oh, I'm good. -[rattles]
Think I'm gonna be all right.
And, uh…
fuck Carol.
Hey, should I drink Carol?
No, no, that's a lot of cholesterol. Right, okay.
I won't go out of my way, but if, like, there's a chance encounter
outside her house at night or…
-Yeah. Later. -See you, guys!
-Bye. -See you, guys.
What about us?
What about us?
I was thinking, what if we tried this whole, you know,
stay on the same groove type thing.
You know, me cooking breakfast. You know?
How about we take it one day at a time, but no more lies.
After what we've seen tonight, there is no reason to lie.
So I ask you a question, and you give me a straight answer.
I can live under those terms, you know.
Yeah, I don't think we're there yet.
Mm-hmm. You just gonna leave me like this?
Mmm. Jump back, want to kiss myself.
[Paige] I'm gonna be a vampire hunter too.
[Bud] Uh… -[Bud] No. -[Joss] No.
-[Paige] Daddy, why do you call me Pickle? -[Bud] Because that's what you are, baby.
Sometimes you're a sweet pickle, sometimes you're a sour pickle,
and sometimes you're a salty pickle.

My parents just emailed that they're coming.
-Are you kidding? What? -Yeah.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Parker.
Yes! Oh, I get to meet your parents, finally!
-[grunting] -[Parker] Oh, okay.
I'm gonna marry this guy.
Oh, gosh, that is-- Oh, you have to be so psyched.
Are you psyched? You're not psyched. Are you psyched at all?
-Is there any psyched happening? -Yeah. Yeah, no, I…
It's… It's totally great. I just…
I've told you. They can be… They can be a lot.
Okay, have you met my parents?
I only picked Skeletor and Medusa

Yeah, I'd probably regret it one day if my parents didn't come to my wedding.
Yes, you would. We're gonna get through this.
'Cause there is nothing He-Man and the pink Power Ranger can't handle together.

Is that a deep cut He-Man reference?
Yeah-ha!
Oh, I love you.
Oh, I love you too.
[Owen's mother on speakerphone] Your Aunt Linda, she's allergic to nickel.
Does the silverware have nickel?
I don't know, Mom.
Cheap silverware has nickel. Nickel-plated, okay?
You're not gonna skimp on the silverware?
I'll make sure we have high-quality, nickel-free silverware.
-Okay? -Good.
But that's not why I called. I've got good news.
Parker's parents can come to the wedding.
Hello? Guys, I know you're there, I can hear Dad's nose whistle.
I'm sorry, what kinda parents skip their own daughter's wedding?
They're not skipping it! That's the thing, they're not!
Oh, please.
I'm sorry, they were living with the Yanomami tribe in the Amazon.
It's not exactly easy for them to travel.
No wonder Parker became a stripper.
She's not a stripper! I've told you a million times!
She runs a yoga studio! A very successful one!
Oh, I didn't know that.
Yes, you knew that! I invited you to a class.
You expect your mother to get on a pole?
-There's no pole! It's a yoga studio! -I'll bet business is booming.
-There's no pole! It's a yoga studio! -I'll bet business is booming. It is booming. Not in the way I think you're inferring.
-I'm just saying. -Please.
Please, can we just not make it weird? Just this one time?
-[parents] Weird? -We're not weird! You're weird!
Your father and I have been talking about it recently.
You've become weird, Owen.
It's true!
[Owen's mother] And you never behaved like that before you met this stripper!

They've been off the grid the whole time we've been together.
That's so fucking weird, man.
Owen, I don't wanna hurt your feelings,
but when you first told us about Parker, we thought you were makin' her up.
That does hurt my feelings.
But it shouldn't hurt your feelings, because I've never seen you with nobody,
so I'm like, "This can't be a real woman. Maybe it's a mannequin or a sex doll."
But guess what? She was real.
When I saw her, I was like, "Girl, you alive!"
This motherfucker made this fairy tale come true.
Because I didn't believe shit you said at first.
This couldn't be hurting my feelings any more.

Uh, why am I even doing this? This isn't my job. This is Gary's job.
Guys, where's Gary?
All right, no more "accidentally" locking Gary in the vault. I'm serious.
It's this new security system you designed.
-Shit is mad complicated. -It should be. It's a vault.
It's state-of-the-art. No one's getting in this bad boy.
Oh! Is this the same one Phoebe King has?
-Essentially. -[woman] Who is Phoebe King?
Phoebe King manages Atlas Reserve, the top bank in the state.
Not a top bank. Mmm-mmm. There's not, like, an official ranking or anything.
100% is, they wrote a whole article. Yeah, that's the top bank in the state.
It's a good bank, decent bank. Clean.
Last conference, Owen got called out by Phoebe King,
by her saying that a Butterball turkey could break into our vault.
I don't exactly remember it like that.
And she called you a dickless troll. -Oh! -Damn!
Now, I tried not to laugh, but I couldn't help it 'cause it was fucking hysterical.
-Imagining you without a dick. -Ooh!
Just nothing but a smooth surface, no genitalia at all.
Dickless troll, that's borderline unprofessional.
Fucking hilarious.
And you know what? I'd love to see a Butterball turkey break into this.

Hey, Gary.
You're lucky I had mints in my pocket. I could have starved in here.
For probably the 50th time,
there's an emergency escape latch on the inside of the door.

And like I keep telling you…
[yelling] I can't find it!
[man whispers] God damn, Gary.
[Owen's mother] So, um, Parker,
um, I understand that your parents are doing the right thing
and coming to your wedding.
Isn't that nice? It's very nice!
-[Owen] Yes, it is! Thanks, Mom. -[Parker] Yeah. Super nice.
[whispers] She hasn't seen her parents for a very long time.
I know. I know.
-How come they're not showing up? -They live in a cave in the jungle.
-Like Bin Laden? -A little like Bin Laden, right.
-[Owen] Um, that's… That's not it. -It's okay, I got it.
-Can I see your tattoos again? -Oh, um, not right now.
-Can I see your tattoos again? -Oh, um, not right now. Your Aunt Margie isn't the biggest fan, so, shh.
She said you got them so you could get bigger tips when you strip.
-Uh, once again, I'm not a stripper. -My boyfriend's gonna get a tattoo.
-[Parker] Oh, yeah? Of what? -My name across his lower back.
-[exclaims] -Hey, cuz!
-[exclaims] -Hey, cuz! Jesus! Hi, buddy. Well, don't…
Jesus! Hi, buddy. Well, don't…
How come I wasn't invited to the, uh, bachelor party?
-You know I'm, like, an EMT now, right? -[mutters] I do know that, yeah.
Yeah, well, I'd love to give you a ride in the ambulance.
-You know, hit the siren, zip around town. -[Owen's father] That's fun.
Yeah, maybe, uh, flatline you in the back, go to the other side.
Ask Grandpa Seymour what it was like dying by, you know…
[Owen's father] Okay, stop it. All right.
-[Owen] Why is he doing that? -[Owen's father] That was a rumor. Stop.
No, man. She walked in on it. She was so sad when she found him.

I'm getting a phone call. Lucky for me. I didn't even plan this.
This just happened coincidentally. Hey, storage space!
Ah, thanks for returning my call!
-This is Owen Browning again. -What the fuck do you want?
Well, I'm getting married in a week,
so I'm putting together a little photo montage.
But here's the thing, I don't have any photos of my fiancée's family.
And rumor has it that they actually have a unit in your storage facility.
Um, it should be under the name McDermott.
-[sinister note plays] -Do… Do you have the locker?
-[Owen's mother] Oh, my God! -[Owen's father] I'm on fire!
-[man] EMT! -Oh, shit.
-[all clamoring] -[man] Soy sauce!
Mom! That's not water!
Yeah. You told me to call if anyone asked about the McDermott locker.

Yes. Do you have a name?
Owen Browning.

What is it?
It's silly. I thought that… [laughs] I thought that button was a trap door to a shark tank or something.

I just wanted someone to come clean up this mess.
-What mess? -You.
[softly] "Shark tank."
Call the aquarium!
Does your dad always keep an extra shirt in the trunk of his car?
[Owen] Ha! Yeah, well… It's not the first time he caught on fire in a restaurant.
And then how about when your niece asked me
if my neck flaps in the wind when I ride a bicycle?
Thank you for not being offended.
They are truly disturbed people.
Ugh, God. Now, you're gonna have to meet my family.
-Are you worried they won't like me? -No, not at all. Are you?
No! Mmm-mmm.
Not liking you is like not liking Mr. Rogers.
The Notorious F-R-E… D.
-When do they come into town? -Not until the night before the wedding.
Oh! That gives me just enough time.
Oh, yeah? Time for what?
[muffled] I've got something special planned. Oh! Is that right?

Yeah, the flight was early, and, uh… Actually, you were singing.
I heard you singing a little ditty about boinking our daughter.
-[Parker] Really? -[both agreeing]
Uh, just a little ditty that I was doing in private.
Didn't know it was, uh, in front of my future in-laws.
-How'd… How'd you guys get in? -The door was unlocked.

There's one thing you need to know about me, my family has hip issues.
And, obviously, wanted to get ahead of it. Went to the doctor. She said, "Have you tried yoga?"
Went to the doctor. She said, "Have you tried yoga?"
-[Billy chuckles] -[Owen] Got a coupon. Went to my first yoga class…
-It was my class. -[laughing] I was teaching the class! I mean, what are the odds?
I was teaching the class! I mean, what are the odds? -Crazy! -Right?
[chuckles] That's amazing.
So then I noticed that halfway through the class, Owen's in child's pose.
Yep. Okay, so get this.
Okay, I'm in child's pose.
And while I'm in child's pose, I pass out, but no one notices. Look.
And while I'm in child's pose, I pass out, but no one notices. Look. [laughing] Look. If I was unconscious right now, you couldn't even tell.
-[Parker] Right? -[Billy] Oh, yeah.
So then everyone leaves, class is over,
and I notice that Owen's still in child's pose.
And I think to myself,
"Oh, fuck. This guy just died. He's dead. He's a goner."
-Mmm-mmm. But I didn't. -[Parker] Nope.
Then, when Parker unfolded me, and I came to,
I looked up at her big, beautiful smile, and I realized…
I looked up at her big, beautiful smile, and I realized… "This is the woman I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with."

I hope you're ready to have some fun because I got us tickets to a South American pottery exhibition.
Why?
Because you guys were living with the Yanomami tribe in the Amazon…
Oh! Oh, yeah.
…who obviously are known for their exquisite pottery.
We spent so many years with that tribe that we're all potteried out.
All right, well, let's go to the next step of our adventure.
The Holocaust Museum!
Honestly, I've been there, like… I would… They've got an amazing food court!
Okay! Look, we're not into pottery and we're not into Holocaust awareness.
Fine. What do you guys want to do?

Was it regular bad, or like really, really terrible?
It was incredible.
I've never met anyone like these people before.
We went skydiving.
We got very drunk.
I did a little dancing.
I finally felt like I was part of the cool crowd in high school,
like I'm a skateboarder, or like I vandalize stuff or something.
I don't, but it feels like I could.

-You gave them the fuckin' code! -[softly] Are you saying I'm an accessory?
No, you ain't no accessory, you are the fucking mastermind!
[laughing] This is gangster! Okay, look, can I be honest with you?
I steal, too, from the bank. That's right.
I haven't bought toilet paper in seven years.
-That was you? -Mmm-hmm!
From the men's and the ladies' bathroom. Come on, that's execution.
I don't care about the toilet paper. I don't care about the toilet paper.
-Hey! Okay, goodbye, thank you. -Hey! Who was that?
The baker. They just called.
The baker. They just called. They said there was a big commotion over there and they can't make the cake.
Wait, what? You're serious?
-I know! -What happened?
-The baker died. -[gasps] Oh, my God!
-How? -Kicked in the chest by a horse.
-Jesus! -Yeah.
Heart exploded on impact.
-Oh, my God. -I know.
-Hey, don't be sad! Hey, don't be sad! -[exclaims]
It's okay, 'cause the… the baker was racist.
-Yeah, like, a bad racist. -Are there good racists?
Well, my grandmother, so… Anyway, what's up?
Uh, my parents made samosas, so I was just coming to tell you.
How light and fun! Samosas! I love that.
-Okay, I'll see you down there. -Just take your time.
-All right? -It'll be okay.
-It's all right, we'll get a new cake. -All right. Yeah.
Definitely not a racist this time. [laughing] All right, love you.
Hi. I'm going to need to cancel a cake order.
Yeah, my fiancée was kicked in the head by a horse.
Why are you so nervous, Owen?
So, I know this might sound crazy,
but I think Parker's parents
might be criminals.
-Yeah! -Well, of course they're criminals.
Why do you think they're skipping their daughter's wedding?
They're coming to the fucking wedding! Okay?
[sputtering] They're literally coming! We're--
Okay.
I think that they are the people that robbed my bank.
-No! How do you know? -I don't.
But I'm not gonna turn Parker's life upside down unless I do know for a fact,
so I need your help, okay?
Okay, okay, here they come. Do that thing you guys do.
What thing?
That thing where you ask highly-invasive, inappropriate personal questions.
Hmm? Okay, come on!
[loudly] Hi, guys! Hey!
Honey. You sure you're up for this?
-Yeah, you? -Oh, yeah. I took a weed gummy.
Smart! Billy and Lilly McDermott, meet my parents Neil and Margie Browning.
-Pleasure to me you, Neil. -It's my pleasure.
-You're very attractive. -Oh, thank you.
That's not a compliment. For me, it's too much.
[Lilly] Well, hi, there.
-Hi, hello. -[Margie] Hi.
[Lilly] Mmm! Oh, wow! Speaking of attractive, you have absolutely flawless skin.
What do you use?
Soap.
-Perhaps we should have some cocktails? -[Lilly] Yeah, cocktails.
The sun is still out.
[laughs nervously] Okay, we got a table. Let's sit down.
It's gonna be fun!
-[McDermotts laughing] -And then I said, "We don't need a gondolier!"
Lilly, she pushes the wee fella off the boat, and we start paddling up the Grand Canal.
So, Billy, Lilly, let me ask you something.
[Billy] Yeah, shoot.
-Have you ever committed a felony? -[Owen gags] Mmm-mmm.
[Margie] No, no, no! Now, if we're gonna be family, we need to know if they're criminals, so…
Now, if we're gonna be family, we need to know if they're criminals, so…
-[Owen] Stop. Don't. -Give me that. Are you criminals?
My parents aren't criminals.
No, that's okay, baby.
I'm sure our lifestyle seems a little, um, unconventional to the Brownings.
Well, yeah, I mean they live in the jungle with the edamame people.
[Owen] No, that's a bean.
-[Neil] What's the name? -Yanomami.
What'd I say?
You said edamame, like at a Japanese restaurant.
They are the people of waitheri, totihi, peheti.
What is that now?
It's a common Yanomami phrase. I'm sure you've heard it.
-Honey, what are you doing? -Nothing! Just striking up a convo.
Owen, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you were quizzing us.
No! It's just… You lived with the Yanomamis for two years.
I'm sure you know what the phrase "waitheri, totihi, peheti" means.
It means courage…
beauty, and truth.
And if we seem a little confused, it's because your accent is so atrocious,
it's an affront to the Yanomami people and their god!
Owen, what the hell is wrong with you?
Anyway! [laughing] The Amazon is a wondrous place.
You two would love it.
Well, we don't travel. Um, Neil has traveler's diarrhea.
-It's not just when I travel. -[Billy] Yeah.
Oh, Margie, I bet under that cautious exterior,
there's a bubbling free spirit waiting to get out.
Oh, no doubt this one was really wild back in the day.
Uh, well, once, before I was pregnant with Owen, I, um…
Uh, well, once, before I was pregnant with Owen, I, um… Well, I participated in an orgy.
-What? -Yeah! [laughs]
-Mom, an orgy? -Yeah!
[shouting] An orgy?
-[Margie] Yes! -Yep.
I'm probably saying it wrong,
but it's that thing where you go and you just fuck everybody.
-Oh, yeah, that's an orgy, all right. -I had a lot of orgies.
-[all laughing] -That's where she met Dan Marino!
-The football player? -Yeah!
Well, it was either there or JCPenney.
Dan Marino doesn't shop at JCPenney. He's a Hall of Famer.
You met Dan Marino at the orgy.
-Oh, Jesus Christ! So is Dad my dad? -Of course I'm your dad!
Don't be ridiculous! Why do you think you have the Browning lower back hair?
I've seen you play sports, I know sure as shit it wasn't Dan Marino!
-[Owen] Wait, what? -[Neil] Dan Marino!
-Here's to Danny boy. -[Margie] Danny!
-[all toasting] -[Lilly] To Danny boy!
Whoo! Touchdown! [laughing]
Hey. Okay, look. So here's me, here's my dad.
The nose, the same beady, little dead eyes. It's the same, right?
-And the lower back hair. -Sweetie, I've seen your back hair.
Okay, of course, but you haven't seen my dad's.
-Should we FaceTime him? -[laughs] No. Can we just talk for a sec?
Yeah!
Everything okay?
What was that at dinner?
Oh, I don't know, just the fact that Dan Marino fucked my mom.
Yeah, I… I know. I know, and your bank got robbed.
And he's a big man.
He is. That's true. Um…
Look, I know you've been through a lot, and that's extremely traumatic,
both things,
but is there something else going on?
Whatever it is, you can tell me.
I won't get mad.
[whispers] Okay?
Okay, all right.
-[doors close] -[Owen] All right.
So the reason I've been acting weird…
I think your parents robbed my bank.
[Parker laughs] What?
-You're being serious? -Yeah, I'm serious!
-One of the robbers knew my name. -It's on the bank website.
But when I stepped on his heel, he turned back, and he looked at me just like your dad.
You said they had masks on.
Yes, they were wearing masks, but it was the same very specific disdain of me.
It's a vibe thing, you know? And…
It's a vibe thing, you know? And… And they knew that "She left me roses by the stairs"
And they knew that "She left me roses by the stairs"
was the voice activation code to get in the vault,
which I'm pretty sure I told your mom about when I was wasted.
Right, okay. Well, does anyone else know the code?
Just a couple-- Just-- Yeah.
Tyree, Gary, Marisol.
I think I told my therapist once, but I don't think she listens to me.
-Wow! -Okay.
You were the one who said that they're a lot.
I meant that they have big personalities, not that they rob banks.
[whispers] I'm not saying that they are bank robbers!
I'm saying that there's a possibility that they're bank robbers.
I'm just floating the idea out there.
Well, now, I'm just floating the idea that you've lost your fucking mind.
[Billy] I can't believe we have to take this shit box.
-[engine revving] -Bank robbing son of a bitch!
Oh, Jesus Christ, this thing moves.
Sor… Sorry!
Sorry.
-[honking continues] -Okay, yep! Sorry!
-[honking continues] -[man] …the fuck up!
Okay. Oh, that was scary.
-Thank you, OnStar. -[automated voice] Happy to help.
The prodigal son has returned, and bearing gifts.
My God. You look like a snack.
I could eat your dick like corn on the cob.
Is this Scarface's house? God dang.
Okay.
Ow! Come on!
-[thump] -[groans] Okay. Now I know why rich people have these.
Can we get on with this?
See, I just don't see any reason why we can't be civil.
Besides, if anyone has a right to be angry, it's me.
I was the one who was betrayed, right?
Oh! Oh, I am so sorry. I'm so sorry, little buddy.
No, no, no, no, no!
There's just under a million in there.
Bravo. Now you just owe me five more.
Mini ones? What, are they cheaper?
We took one million, not six.
And have you forgotten how this works?
While you were running, so was the vig.
-[dogs barking] -I'm sorry I kicked your friend!
Oh, look at you little guys. You guys are adorable from up here.
If only you were a wee bit taller.
-[branch snaps] -[Owen] Ow! Why?
Five million's gonna take us some time, Rehan.
Do I look like an unreasonable woman?
No. You have till end of week.
[grimacing] I'm sorry. Does that interfere with your daughter's wedding?
Oh, shit!
Are you surprised that I am aware that you have a daughter?
And she… Let's hypothetically call her, I don't know, Parker?
…is getting married on Saturday.
If you don't get me my five million dollars before the wedding, then Parker…
my five million dollars before the wedding, then Parker… is marrying the Grim Reaper.
-Meaning she'll be killed. -Yeah, yeah, I get it. I get it.
[Rehan] I know you got it, darling.
Did I mention I have a new shark tank?
Maybe your daughter could test it out for me.
Those fuckers are hungry.
-[phone line ringing] -Pick up, Parker!
-Parker, pick up! -[automated voice] Thank you for--
-Son of a-- -[siren whoops]
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no!
Oh, God!
-Okay. -[tense music playing]
Hey, officer, how can I help you?
License and masturbation, please.
-Okay, good morning. -[laughing] You look like shit.
And that's coming from a guy who uses his sock as a filter for his coffee.
No, I'm doing great. -Thanks for asking. -Mmm.
There appears to be a dog gnawing on your leg.
Yeah, that's just my little buddy. My little bud.
We just took a walk in the woods.
You know, it's funny,
the Ghost Bandits knew precisely how to circumvent the security system in your bank.
And when I called SunRidge to find out who designed the system,
you know what they said?
[scoffs] Are you insinuating that I had something to do with it?
Do you mind popping the trunk?
-Pop the trunk. -Okay, this is insane. I'll say that. I mean, this is ridiculous.
I'll say that. I mean, this is ridiculous. I haven't committed a crime in my entire life.
First time for everything!
-[metal door slams] -[Oldham] Let's see.
We got a couple burner phones,
two boxes of nine mil, and…
[distorted] …voice modulator.
Someone put this stuff in my trunk.
[distorted] Who, Owen? Who are you working with?
-[distorted] Who, Owen? -I…
I don't… I don't know.
Okay, look, I get it. I forget things too sometimes.
So how about a nice, long weekend in a jail cell to help jog your memory?
I'm… I'm supposed to get married this weekend.
You know, I was married once, to a beautiful woman named Sheryl.
-You know where she is now? -Is she dead?
I wish.
No, she lives in Key West with her new husband.
Former Navy SEAL.
Rock-hard abs, and a cock you can land a 747 on.
That's a big plane.
It's a wide plane.
Anyway, I became so obsessed with catching the Ghost Bandits
that it cost me my marriage.
My house.
Maybe even my sanity.
I mean, after a while, I started wondering if the Ghost Bandits…
I mean, after a while, I started wondering if the Ghost Bandits… you know, were real ghosts.
Hey! Let's funnel this energy into getting Sheryl back!
Right? I can make a photo montage.
Don't let this guy with this giant cock win over you!
-[sighs] Lock him up. -Wait, no! My wedding!
Oh, you're gonna have a wedding,
and quite the bachelor party in D block this weekend.
It wasn't me.
It was my in-laws.
They robbed my bank, and I did not help them.
They used me.
Damn, boy, you flip quick.
Prove it. Put on a wire and get 'em to confess.
-You want me to be a rat? -I want you to do the right thing, Owen.
Clear your name, and help me catch the Ghost Bandits.
And also, yes, be a little bit of a rat.
[whispers] Parker.
-[door closes] -[whispers] Parker! Hey, Parker!
-[Parker] There you are! Where you been? -We have to talk.
-Why are you pinching your chest? -Because I'm wearing a--
[nervously] Whoa, gosh! A… soft shirt! Whoa! Feels like my fingers are at a finger spa.
-Really? Looks pretty starchy-- -Don't touch me!
I'm sorry. It's just…
I'm sorry. It's just… the in-laws aren't supposed to touch the groom before the wedding.
-That's horseshit. -Are you high right now, Owen?
I don't do illegal things, unlike other people.
Other people do… illegal things, and I'm cool with that too.
And if we want to talk about that and just sort of get things off our chest…
Okay, uh, we gotta go, 'cause we gotta be at the bakery.
The bakery! Yep! Okay, I think me and you should just go to the bakery,
just because our baker died, we gotta get a new cake.
Perhaps we should all just go together. One big happy family.
You guys don't wanna run errands.
I do.
Of course we do. Who doesn't like desserts?
Well, they're vegan desserts, and we all know that they taste like shit.
I'm sorry, Parker, but I'm being honest with you.
They taste like shit, okay?
So you guys should stay, we should go eat the shit. Come on.
[Parker on mic] As long as we leave now.
[Owen] Oh, we're all going. Cool, good. All right! Okay!
[singsong] Okay! Oh, we're tasting cakes at 1308 Grant Avenue!
You know, when I go on a trip, I usually take two bags. I have a carry-on, then I check one too.
-[on mic] I check one, two. -Schmuck.
[Owen] You're driving! Billy McDermott is driving! Cool.
Hey, do you want to play Never Have I Ever?
Never have I ever worn a scary mask when it wasn't Halloween.
Now your turn.
[Owen] We have arrived. I am one click south of the door.
You guys sure you don't wanna wait in the car? No? Okay.
We are zero clicks from the door. -I am opening the door. -[bell ringing]
-[Owen] Right this way, come on in. -[Billy] Go ahead. Smells good.
-[Owen] Right this way, come on in. -[Billy] Go ahead. Smells good. Nice. Yep, that's cake.
Nice. Yep, that's cake.
Welcome to Vegan Divas. Where you can get your cake--
-[door opens loudly] -And eat it too! I'm Kay.
-[door opens loudly] -And eat it too! I'm Kay. And this is my sister Ida.
She's the vegan and I'm the diva.
Thank you so much for fitting us in last minute.
-Yep. -Don't even worry about it. I totally get last minute. I'm never on time for anything.
I totally get last minute. I'm never on time for anything.
Are you sure about this? [laughs]
[whispers] Our wedding is at a very specific time.
No, it's okay. The reviews were great.
-This is just their shtick. -[head bangs]
[Kay on mic] Why do I keep doing that? [Ida] Hey, I think you might be bleeding.
-[Kay] Ida! -[Ida] Okay, I'm sorry.
-[Kay] Cake! Hurry! -[Ida] Okay.
So this is our Better-Than-Sex red velvet cake
that Ida makes from scratch.
And that name is no lie.
I've compared them both.
Mmm! And this is vegan?
Oh, yeah.
[softly] Parker, can I speak with you in private real quick?
What's wrong?
-I like to concur… -What? Sure. …about, you know, important life decisions before we make them.
-You know? Mmm-hmm. -Really?
-You have a little something here. -What's that, sweetheart?
What the fuck?
I'm sorry! I didn't know you guys were together!
[laughs] Owen, what's going on?
Okay, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but the FBI thinks
Okay, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but the FBI thinks -I had something to do with the robbery. -What?
-They made me wear-- -[doors open]
Oh! What a lovely little bakery.
-You must be Parker! -Hi.
-[Parker yelps] -[all clamoring] -[loudly] Ah! Nobody make a scene! -You're the one with the gun, Rehan.
-[loudly] Ah! Nobody make a scene! -You're the one with the gun, Rehan.
Yes, you are the one with the gun holding hostages right now…
Yes, you are the one with the gun holding hostages right now… -[on mic] …inside of the bakery. -[gags] Oh, hostages!
-[on mic] …inside of the bakery. -[gags] Oh, hostages!
-What the hell is going on? -Listen, Rehan. -We told you we'd get you the money. -Oh, yes. No, you did.
-We told you we'd get you the money. -Oh, yes. No, you did. But then I remembered you are liars.
Just in case you were planning on slithering away into the shadows again,
I thought I'd come here for a little… -insurance. -[Parker yelps]
-[Rehan] Come along, Parker. -Hey, hey, hey! Just take me instead.
Take me!
You little Build-A-Bear? You think you're hostage material?
No one here gives two shits whether you live or die!
Look at them and check in with them.
Oh! Zero shits given.
I don't understand. Was Owen right?
Just do what she says.
Stay calm, baby. Just stay calm.
So emo! Getting choked up.
-Dad? Dad? -I like getting choked, though.
You can eat my cake anytime!
Please, God, save my fiancée who is exiting the back of the bakery right now.
FBI! Freeze!
God'll save you, Parker!
[whining loudly] Please! God, please! Please! Please, God!
Ahh! Oh! Oh, shit!
Come on, Roger! You got this, Roger! Be a man, you dickhead!
-[shrieking continues on mic] -God, man!
-[Parker] Fuck you! -[Rehan] Go on, take her!
-[Parker] Fuck you! -[Rehan] Go on, take her! Get the fuck in! Get in the car!
I'm going after her.
What the fuck? Oh, son of a bitch.
Everything's fucking cake in here!
I'm going after her!
No! You're gonna get yourself killed! Get down! Get down!
You're really fuckin' getting on my tits!
-[music stops] -Shut up!
Lilly! Lilly, the front!
Let's go.
Go for the tires.
[Rehan] Get me my fucking money!
Ah, shit.
I fucking love this job!
-[loud bang] -[Rehan] Motherfuckers!
[Oldham] Freeze!
[Billy] What?
Put your guns down.
Put 'em down now.
-They got our daughter. -Don't move!
-[Billy] Motherfucker! -[groaning]
You! You were supposed to protect her!
This is why people don't trust the federal government.
This is on you! Hey! Hey!
Let me in! Hey, let me in!
No, no, no, no, no!
Let me in! Let me in!
-Okay, I committed. [grunting] -[engine revving]
What happened?
-[Billy] Oh, Jesus. -[Owen] Ow!
[Billy] Come on, get your ass out here. There you go.
Ahh! Why are we stopped? We gotta go after her!
-I know where that woman lives! -Rehan has houses everywhere.
-I know where that woman lives! -Rehan has houses everywhere. We have no idea where she took Parker.
[Billy] Even if you did, what were you gonna do?
Sneak into the bushes and get chased up a tree by a pack of tiny dogs?
Parker is in the wind.
-I'm sorry. -Well, what are we gonna do now?
The first thing we're gonna do is you're gonna take that fucking wire off.
[Billy] You little shit bag.
I knew you were a coward but I didn't take you to be a rat.
Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna take the fall for you guys!
We never asked you to.
No! You just framed me!
You put bank-robbing evidence in the trunk of my car!
He wouldn't have been convicted of anything!
It was just enough to tie him up
and save Parker from making the biggest mistake of her life.
[yelling] She just got kidnapped because of you!
Before you came back in her life, the worst thing that happened to Parker?
She burned the roof of her mouth on a home-made flatbread.
I would've blown on it, but I couldn't. I had a cold.
How could you guys possibly know what she wants? Or needs? You weren't there!
Or needs? You weren't there!
Because we were trying to fucking protect her, that's why!
Rehan used to be our partner.
She would choose the bank and clean the money.
And then she started to fuckin' lose it!
We were afraid she would find out about Parker.
So on the last job, we just took the money and ran.
I don't give a shit. I don't care what happened, okay?
-I just care about getting Parker back. -Oh, yeah, you and me both.
You need five million in two days. So you're gonna rob another bank, right?
Wouldn't hurt to have a bank manager on the team.
Someone who knows the bank's weaknesses, which ones have excess cash holdings,
when and where they move that cash.
He gets nervous cracking an egg. You think he can rob a bank?
If it's to save Parker? Fuck yeah, I'll rob a bank!
We always knew they were criminals.
[whispers] They drink during the day.
Yeah. Yeah. Hey, and the daughter… is a yoga instructor.
I'm not saying anything, but, you know, connect the dots.
Do you have any idea where they might've gone?
Does Owen have any access to a family cabin or anything like that?
A, um, a vacation home--
Vacation home? What, are you kidding me?
Who do we look like, The Jeffersons?
Here's a list of all the banks within a 100-mile radius,
arranged by on-site cash holdings, from ValueBank all the way up to--
Atlas Reserve, 20 million dollars.
-One-stop shopping. -Hmm! Easy.
[laughing] Yeah, I wish!
-[Billy] No? -No.
We can't rob Atlas Reserve.
Phoebe King has that place on lock.
Who's Phoebe King?
I thought you guys were the Ghost Bandits. You don't know who Phoebe King is?
-She pioneered bandit barriers. -[upbeat music playing]
[Owen] Every inch of her bank is triple secured.
I'd fuck me.
And her vault?
I'm talking biometrics, weight sensitivity,
not to mention randomized time locks! [laughing] Okay?
When did you make this?
When I walked to the vending machine, got a Diet Squirt.
Weirdly, I had a lot of it in my pockets.
So, let me get this straight.
You made a model of a bank we're not gonna rob?
Oh, wow. There's another one. He made two.
I made 12. Only two are presentable.
See, we don't want a Phoebe King.
What we need is Victory Union, a bank whose manager is lazy.
A total turd.
-What we need is a Vince Millen. -[upbeat music continues]
Vince lost his right testicle because, one time,
Vince lost his right testicle because, one time, he sat on his nuts too hard.
[Owen] The reason he got hired is 'cause his dad owns the bank.
[man] Okay.
[Owen] The most important thing about Vince is that he cuts corners.
Federal regulations limit how much cash a branch can hold for security and insurance purposes.
When you go over the limit,
a manager has to arrange for a cash pick-up from the vault.
[Vince] Yo, lock up for me. I got paintball.
Now, the armored truck is supposed to take the cash directly to the repository,
but Vince hates paperwork.
So he has the same armored truck
collect cash from all three branches he manages
before going to the repository.
So if we hit that truck after the pickup from the third branch…
-It's like robbing three banks in one. -[Owen claps]
-We just need disguises. -[Owen] Yep.
And I need a gun.
-What? Oh, my gosh. -Mmm-hmm.
-It's way lighter than I thought it'd be. -It's a water gun.
-Is it? -Mmm-hmm.
Do I still look cool?
Yeah, you look like James Bond.
Which one?
-Five. -Oh, that was a good one.
Everybody on the ground, now! -Don't be a hero! -[vault door opens]
Hey, Donkey!
Oh, God! That was really violent!
How'd you like my accent? Did it sound Irish or Scottish?
It was supposed to sound Scottish but I think it came out Irish.
Don't tell Billy.
[Lilly] Focus! We're robbing a bank here.
And remember, you're in charge.
That's right! I'm in charge, okay?
So no one try to be a hero.
I will cap a motherfucker!
I will cap your ass!
Everybody, stay down, all right?
You guys like Shrek? Who's your favorite character?
Mine's Shrek.
What are you doing? Don't get up. Do not get up!
[nervously] Okay, and you did. But stay right there, all right?
Do not come towards me. Do not come tow-- Don't rush towards me!
Easy breezy.
What the fuck?
Freeze!
Nice and easy, boy-o. I gotcha.
Put the gun down. Put it down.
That's very good.
Lilly! I got this, get the money!
[Lilly] Come on, kid, where the fuck are you?
[Billy] About time, Shrek.
Sorry, a big guy that looked like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's character from Moana had a heart attack, so I had to give him CPR.
from Moana had a heart attack, so I had to give him CPR.
How's your part going? -[Lilly] Three against two. Drop 'em. -[guard] What do we do?
-[Lilly] Three against two. Drop 'em. -[guard] What do we do?
-I don't know. -You drop 'em.
Can we hurry up? [yells] Can we hurry this up?
Okay, all right, just put 'em down.
Easy down now.
What the fuck?
-Oh, shit. -[Lilly] Son of a bitch!
Oh! Oh, God!
That boy's a real dumbass.
-[Lilly] Fuck, there goes our getaway. -Okay.
-[rock music playing] -Get in!
Go! Go, go, go!
All right, yeah! We're doing this.
Shut up and drive!
Okay, yeah, let's go.
You know, I always wanted to be a school bus driver.
The money! The money, the money!
Oh, no, no, no. That's not good.
[Billy] I'm gonna kick your green ass, Shrek!
I thought we defunded the police.
[Owen] I'm sorry!
Yep, now they're angry.
-[gun firing] -[bullets ricocheting]
[Owen] Oh, God!
He'll be fine, it's fine.
[Lilly] Where the fuck is he going?
-[Lilly screaming] -[Owen] Oh, my God!
Lord forgive us, Mary and Joseph!
[priest] …to light, as our hearts mourn during this time--
Goal! [chuckles]
Have you no dignity?
Pretty sure my great-grandma was buried in here.
Shut the fuck up!
[Owen] Okay.
Oh, shit.
Why?
-Oh, shit! -[alarm chiming]
-Oh, shit! -[alarm chiming] -[Owen] God. -What the fuck is that?
My Go-Gurts! Snack time. Gotta keep the blood sugar up.
-[Lilly] Give me that. -You want to pick a flavor?
-[Lilly] Fucking Go-Gurts! -[Billy] Snack time!
-[officer] Shit! -[exclaiming]
[Billy] Oh, shit.
[Owen] How much did we clear?
Sixty bucks.
Sixty bucks.
Okay, that's a building block.
I'm sorry. What the fuck is this?
You don't know him? This is Babayan.
He's like the Kanye of the former Soviet Bloc.
Is the Kanye here?
Shut the fuck up and dance!
Do my parents rob banks?
Do I have a magical pussy?
The answer is yes.
Your parents, they are magnificent bank robbers.
I mean, when they disappeared, I felt… betrayed.
[Rehan] You try to run?
[Rehan] Stupid bitch.
Now, pay attention.
Babayan is about to do his grand finale.
-[upbeat music continues] -[Rehan] Hoorah, Babayan! Hoorah, Babayan!
I think I left my phone in there.
Okay, guess Uber's out of the question.
CPR?
You stopped to give someone CPR?
-My training kicked in. -You foolish gobshite!
Okay, stop it! We have less than 24 hours to get that money.
Oh, forget about the money.
We need to rescue Parker first, then leave the country.
We are not running this time.
Parker made a real life for herself here.
-It's what's best for her. -No, that's what's best for us.
I… I have an idea.
We could rob Atlas Reserve.
What happened to, "One does not rob Phoebe King?"
One doesn't, but maybe three does?
I don't know. I just-- I know a way in.
I just don't know we could get out once the police show up.
Well, maybe we can get a little help there.
Ghost Bandits on three.
Three…
Okay, that was gonna be a cool moment. Hey, guys, wait up!
Earlier today, a man dressed as the popular animated character Shrek
attempted to rob Victory Union Bank, but he soon discovered that it's not so…
That's 100% Owen in a Shrek costume. I could recognize his giant ass anywhere.
-No, it's not. -It's not.
Damn, he's going nuts.
Why is he on TV?
I'm gonna call him again.
-Hello? -It's Billy.
Oh, it's Billy.
-Okay-- -You listen to me.
You touch one single hair on my son's back, and I swear to God--
Shut up and listen, I'm not gonna touch your son's back hair.
But I am gonna use him to rob a bank.
If you don't want to see him go to prison, we're gonna need getaway drivers.
Wait, hold on! You want us to be getaway drivers?
So be at Owen's bank tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.
-And keep the engine running! -[whispers] Let me talk! Let me talk!
[crying] Mom? Dad? I'm so scared! I'm so scared! Please…
Please, if you love me at all,
don't tell Agent Oldham at the FBI anything.
Honey, I swear.
We will tell no one!
No one!
-What time did they say? -10:00 a.m.
Why does your clock say 8:00?
Oh, I took a business trip to Phoenix once, I never changed it back.
Something's not right here.
[Owen] Good. Coast is clear.
Told you they wouldn't be an accessory to a crime.
Owen, you better take this.
Whoa, heft.
That's not tap water. It's lead.
Do not under any circumstances--
Oh, Jesus.
Do not pull the trigger.
All right. Game time.
Await my signal.
Just think of how many terrible decisions we had to make
to get to this moment in time,
with everything riding on this pasty little goober.
We're so fucked.
Yeah, well, this pasty little goober is about to rob his second bank for our daughter.
I like him.
[Owen] I'm sorry, but I don't know what I'm doing.
My bank got robbed and I didn't do anything to stop it. I suck! I suck so bad!
I suck! I suck so bad!
First off, stop crying.
Whenever I hear babies cry, I lactate.
Can't ruin another suit.
Look, I need your help.
Can you show me your vault so I can see what a real security system looks like?
-So you want to see inside my vault? -Yeah.
Remember when I told you a Butterball turkey could break into your vault?
-Yeah, I remember. -Make that sound.
If I do, would you let me into the vault?
Do it! [imitates turkey gobbling] Come on!
-[imitates gobbling] -With your throat.
-[both gobbling] -Louder. -[gobbling loudly] -There you go.
Let's go.
-Pretty heavy duty. -[Phoebe] Yeah, you like that, huh?
[giggles] It's a decoy!
I'm not gonna have a safe this pathetic. What am I, you?
[mockingly] "I'll just put one big circle on the front and that's what locks it."
Freak.
-Don't look. -Okay.
The last numbers are irrelevant. That's how I masturbate.
That feels good.
[softly] Phoebe King.
You know it, bitch.
Is that…
Triple-enforced titanium with digital, manual, and combination locks?
Pussy.
Don't tell me when I can take a fuckin' break.
I take a break when I fuckin' feel like it.
[laughs] Shit! You know what I mean? I don't care if it ain't--
That Owen's parents? The fuck are they doing at the job?
Mr. and Mrs. Browning! What's going on with y'all?
[laughing] How y'all doing?
Why y'all look like that? Y'all look real stiff and kinda paranoid.
Real statuesque, like you… you in a wax museum or something.
-Hey, is that a cop in your backseat? -[Oldham] I'm not a cop.
I'm an agent. And could you please keep your voice down?
First of all, what's the fuckin' difference, okay? You don't run nothing here! This ain't your jurisdiction!
You don't run nothing here! This ain't your jurisdiction! -[whispers] Tyree! Tyree! Shh! -What?
-[whispers] Tyree! Tyree! Shh! -What?
Don't tell anybody, but your bank's about to be robbed.
What do you mean, don't tell nobody? They about to rob the bank again?
-Shh! -[yelling] What the fuck, man?
Damn it! Man, I haven't even… I left some shit in the microwave!
-Shh! -Fuck! I haven't even taken my lunch yet!
No, you don't shush me! -Fuck this! I'm out. -[Oldham] Ugh!
-[Tyree yells in distance] Fuck! The fuck… -Why did you say that?
-I told you not to say anything. -[Tyree faintly] This job fucking sucks!
[softly] Just like Owen told you not to say anything.
It's a setup! It's a setup! They're going after a different bank!
-[grunts] Get out, I'm taking the car. -Not a chance.
It's taken me years to get this seat exactly the way I like.
Oh, God!
God damn it!
-Where to? -Atlas Reserve! They're desperate.
-[thrilling music stops suddenly] -[Oldham] Come on! Come on!
Little faster, please?
And now for the money shot.
Synchronized manual locks.
Yeah.
-It's not the most discreet signal. -[chirping continues]
-[chirping continues] -Jesus, Owen, we got it.
Shut the fuck up! If this kid makes it out alive, I'm gonna kill him.
Shut the fuck up! If this kid makes it out alive, I'm gonna kill him. -[car alarm wailing] -[Billy] Fuckin' hell!
Three, two, one, and release.
-[vault door hissing] -Pull.
[Billy] This is a robbery! -Everyone on the ground now! -[people screaming]
What the fuck is that? Oop!
I'm sorry! I'm a coward!
I suck at bank managing! I can't believe I pulled it off.
[Phoebe muted] Owen, you fucking coward!
[Phoebe] Great, now I'm lactating.
Yes! Yes!
-[Lilly yells] -[guard groans]
I'm coming for you, Parker.
Nope! That didn't go as planned.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
-No! No! -[Billy] Come on, sunshine, out you get.
[dispatch on radio] All units, we received an alarm from Atlas Reserve Bank.
-Robbery in progress. -I knew it. Let's go, Neil, faster. -I drive smart, I don't drive fast. -[angrily] At least do the speed limit!
-I drive smart, I don't drive fast. -[angrily] At least do the speed limit!
Your son's life depends on it!
-[Margie] Faster! -All right! All right, here goes!
With your permission?
You're kind of reminding me of Dan Marino right now.
Dan Marino?
I met him at an orgy once.
Ha! You think his arm was big? Whoa!
I wouldn't know. I was in the car.
All right, emergency escape latch. Every vault has one.
How can Gary never find this?
[on loudspeaker] Hey, cuz, did somebody order a bank robbery getaway driver?
[imitates siren] Yo! Hey, what up?
-How'd the robbery go? -Shut up!
Yo, man, I got morphine in the back if you want to do a little drip--
-Let's go, come on! -Yeah, let's go!
-[yelling] Drive! -Yeah, of course.
-[parents] Was that them? -Get out! Get in the back, I'm driving!
You know what? I get sick in the back. Margie, would you mind gettin' in the back?
No! I don't want to get in the back. It smells like eggs.
[yelling] Come on, let's go!
-[Neil] All right! -Okay, I'm going.
-Fine. All right. -[Neil] Here we go. Okay.
You know what? If you just get out and walk around, it's faster!
[Neil] No, no, no! It's easier this way.
-No! -[Neil] I'm moving. I'm in too deep. I made the commitment.
Just-- Okay, all units, suspects fleeing northbound on Elm.
All right, come on, go, go, go!
[Neil] Oh, Jesus! Oh, Jesus!
[Rehan] This is the first time I've seen you look attractive.
This is the dress that I was going to wear when your father finally came around.
It's sexy. It's tasteful.
I look like a meth-head lottery winner
marrying Machine Gun Kelly at a cruise boat casino.
I love Machine Gun Kelly.
He has that skinny dick energy.
[Owen on loudspeaker] Hey, we got that cash delivery!
Bitches!
Finally. Interesting choice of vehicle.
Don't forget to give me five stars.
Uber?
It's okay.
It's all right there. Five million.
Where are Billy and Lilly?
They're off distracting the police.
-[siren continues] -Aw, shit. It's not the volume. Sorry. -[siren stops] -Sorry! Just-- Sorry, my bad.
Parker! What's up? It's RJ. Remember Roy's Teppanyaki?
Owen… you did it!
Bravo! Very well done!
Well, look.
My debt is paid, you're free to go.
I think we should just split this money 50/50, as a wedding present.
I'm joking! I'm going to kill the shit out of both of you.
Nope! Freeze, all right? Stay right where you are!
I got you now!
Let her go.
Oh, Owen, you're so sweet! Put that gun down, you man-child.
What the fuck do you think you're doing?
Did they give me a fuckin' water gun again?
-Oh, my God! -Holy fucking shit!
[RJ muted] Whoa! My cuz is a straight-up murderer!
Oh! Oh, God! Parker.
-Owen, are you okay? -Parker, Parker, Parker! Oh, my God.
-[Parker exclaims] -Parker! Are you okay?
-[Parker] Yeah. -Are you okay? Oh, my God.
-Oh, you… -[car approaching]
-My God, what happened? -[Owen] I don't know.
I got sweat on my gun so I thought it was a squirt gun.
-It wasn't. It was a bullet gun. -What?
What the fuck? You guys are bank robbers? You've been lying to me my entire life?
We're trying to protect you, baby. That's why we don't see you.
-We're trying to keep you safe. -And what about Owen, huh?
You dragged him into it. What if he'd gotten killed?
You… You couldn't have held him back if you tried. Really?
You're the most important person in the world to me, so…
He's a top man, he… he did really well.
I've… I've grown fond of you.
You did good.
Here you go.
Nah, put that hand away.
-We're family. -What?
-I didn't use tongue. -I did.
-[sirens wailing] -Uh-oh. Here we go, showtime.
We dragged every cop in the city here. Go on, skedaddle.
You don't want to be in jail on your wedding day.
-Move it. -[Owen] Love you.
-[RJ] Ow! -[Owen] Let's go! Come on.
Billy and Lilly McDermott, I finally caught you!
-[rock music fading] -Is the danger over?
God, you suck.
-[Kay] Hurry, Ida! -I'm trying. -[Kay] Hurry up! -I'm trying.
Look, let me tell you somethin', I've been doing bank security for years.
What people don't realize, it's all about prevention. You gotta keep your head on a swivel.
That's what I do, I see everything in that bank.
If somebody gonna rob it, that's on me, baby. [laughing]
But also I gotta get a new job, 'cause I quit.
[boy] You got him!
-Oh, she's having an allergic reaction! -Is there nickel in this spoon?
-Oh, dear, I guess one slipped through. -Oh, she'll be all right.
Don't worry, everybody chill! I got this!
Yeah! I'm not a hero. I'm just an EMT.
Oh, shit. This won't help.
But you're vaccinated!
-[laughing] I'll be right back. -[Margie] Aunt Linda--
Husband.
Yes, my wife?
Thank you.
For everything. This has been… one hell of a week.
Of course.
-I love you. -I love you.
[Gary on mic] And now, ladies and gentlemen,
for the first time as a married couple,
-Owen and Parker Browning! -[both] Whoo! -["Levitating" continues playing] -[guests cheering]
[RJ] Aw, you look so good.
What are you doing here?
You can't let a simple little thing like going to prison get in the way of your daughter's wedding, now can you?
Did you guys break out?
They get one dance and one slice of cake.
[Lilly] We made a deal.
We pled guilty, and then we tracked down an old friend of his.
-Wait, is that Sheryl? -Oh, yeah.
-May I? -Of course.
Come on, sugar. Come to Mama. Let's show 'em how to do it.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm happy for him.
Me too.
-I mean, prison? -Well…
Okay, but it's nice they could show up.
[Billy] Hold up.
Oh, yeah! Everyone's getting pregnant tonight!
They robbed our bank the other day.
Held me at gunpoint. This shit is really fucked up.
I got this piece especially for you.
Oh, that's very kind of you, Owen. Thank you. [chuckling]
[softly] Don't chip a tooth.
Good lad.
'Cause there's something inside of it.
-Yeah, we did get it. We're fine. -Okay.
-[whispers] It's a paperclip. -[Lilly] Okay.
-[Owen] I left the key in the Hellcat. -Shut up.
-I got it. I got it. -Okay. All right, enjoy.
"I'LL NEVER FORGET THE SCREAMS UTTERED WHEN THE BOMB HIT THE SITE"
"THE SCHOOL, DARK FROM BEING SHUTTERED, CHILDREN CRYING OUT OF FRIGHT"
Early on in 1945, the resistance had repeatedly asked the British
to bomb the Gestapo headquarters at the Shell House in Copenhagen.
The Royal Air Force hesitated.
Captured members of the resistance were kept under the roof as human shields. However, in March, the Gestapo was so close to unraveling the resistance
However, in March, the Gestapo was so close to unraveling the resistance
that a decision was made to attack.
JUTLAND, FEBRUARY 1945
There's a run in my stocking.
We can use the nail polish.
Somebody wants to talk to you.
-They came to my house. -What?
My mom said two men came to the house.
-Can I stay here? Just for a while? -Here?
-Just for a few hours. -No. Are you crazy?
-Why not? -You just can't. Svend, please leave.
They'll kill me.
I can't help you.
Do you understand? I can't.
Did you talk to Petersen?
I can't find him.
I would go to the Shell House.
I'll see you there later. The Shell House?
Yes.
-I'll go there. -Good.
Frede?
I owed you ten kroner.
Bye.
Do you have to wear that shit uniform at the table?
Come on now. It's just a white shirt.
Why do we live with that vermin?
Huh? Can you tell me that?
Shame on you.
Shame.
Did you have a good day, Grandma?
That is not the son you gave birth to.
The son you gave birth to isn't here anymore.
What happened to him?
He became a HIPO pig. A traitor.
-How fucking dare you! Come here! -Don't touch me, Dad.
-Leave me alone, pig! -What's wrong with you?
-Don't touch me! -Stand up, goddammit.
Our fists will crush them if they spite us
Youth, Youth
Our flag-- I know, Dad!
Our flag waves ahead of us
We march into the future with our men
We march for Hitler Through the night and suffering
With the flag of Youth… What does she want down here? Down
What does she want down here? Down
She wants to marry Henrik Henrik, Henrik
She wants to marry Henrik Henrik
So please say yes and smile Smile, smile Say yes and…
Would you watch Selma for a minute?
WINDOWS - BLINDS - PICTURES
A girl came a-walking Walking, walking
A girl came a-walking Walking
And what does she want down here? Down, down
And what does she want down here? Down, down What does she want down here? Down
She wants to marry Henrik Henrik, Henrik
She wants to marry Henrik Henrik
But she is not allowed Allowed, allowed
She is not allowed Allowed
-Svend! -So she wants to marry Peter… Svend Nielsen!
She wants to marry Peter…
Svend! Svend Nielsen?
Are you Svend Nielsen?
-No, that's not me. -Show me your ID.
-It's not me. -Show me your papers.
-Come on. -It's not me.
It's not me.
It's not me.
It's not me.
Well, that looks okay.
You should say hello to Poul.
Damn it.
-Take a look, Herr Schultz. -Yes, sir.
Eva! Dad, it's Eva from my class.
Eva, it's me, Greta.
Eva.
-Who do you think that was? -A snitch.
He knew too much.
Did he know too much, Mom?
Was it because he knew too much?
Come on.
Come on.
Honey, there's nothing there.
Henry, we're going to be late.
We'll be… Come on now!
Henry…
Henry!
What's the matter, Henry?
You stubborn little mite.
We can't go anywhere.
But the worst part is the voice.
That's no good at all, is it, Henry?
You need to answer your mother when she asks you a question.
If you don't reply, it'll make your mother nervous.
And then, of course, you can't tell us what's wrong.
What did you see out there?
Tell me.
What did you see?
Did you see the people in the car?
I don't understand it at all.
You've got to say something, Henry!
Speak!
Say something.
Pull yourself together!
Be a man instead of a measly little weakling!
It might sound harsh, but sometimes the best cure is to scare them a bit.
Can you say something now, Henry? Can you?
Can you say something now?
Can you?
Apparently not.
I've been thinking…
I have a sister in Copenhagen.
Not a lot of blue skies there, and he fears the sky the most.
So your reward is a trip to Copenhagen
for acting like a sissy.
Well, well. Good luck with that, then.
This is what will happen.
I'll ask you a question.
If you do not reply, I'll ask you if you're ready.
And then I'll whip you.
Shall we get started?
-I don't know anything. I'm just-- -No, you're just a small fish.
-Correct. That's what I am. -You're no fish.
You're a gnat. A little gnat of a human being.
Take off your shirt. Straddle the chair with your arms up.
As you wish.
You'll talk, all right.
You all do.
It may not look impressive.
As the first lash hits you, you'll think your pain threshold is really high.
But it's not.
The next lash is excruciating.
We know you're one of the leaders.
Which of these names do you work with?
Truelsen, Schoch, Bork Andersen, Lippmann, Tiemroth?
I know an Andersen.
It's my local butcher.
Ready?
Where do you normally hold your meetings?
-I don't know… -Ready?
Just lean into it.
That'll make it easier.
What's the line of command between the SOE and the Freedom Council? Ready?
What?
I can't hear you.
Your time's up, you dirty traitor.
You're not supposed to hit me when I'm not ready.
You ask the question, ask if I'm ready, and then you hit me!
That was the deal.
You despicable subhuman!
Come here.
What are you doing? Step away from the door.
A FREE DENMARK
Sister Teresa?
Sister Teresa?
-Yes. -The Prioress wants to speak with you.
They say you're flogging yourself.
We're not 15th-century Jesuits.
We're the Sisters of St. Joseph.
Why are you doing it?
Well, say something, girl.
I'm looking for God.
I beg your pardon?
I'm looking for God.
And why would He appear before you if you flog yourself?
If it's a sin, He'll punish me for it. Then I'll know God sees me.
God doesn't bother with your pain.
Teresa, God is omnipresent. But He can't be.
With everything that's happening…
Does God really think so little of us humans?
God loves us humans.
And are the Jews not humans?
Maybe it's because they don't believe Christ to be the Son of God.
And is that punishable by death?
What about the children bombed in London and Berlin?
The ones we hear about being dragged off to and killed in camps?
-We don't know anything about that. -Are they not humans?
Teresa, God is both within you
and in those suffering.
He can't take away their suffering, but…
He can offer them comfort.
And what if they lose their faith?
Then they've nothing left.
Yes.
Then they've nothing left.
I am the beautiful Elizabeth of Thuringia.
There is famine and distress in this world.
It's really hard right now.
Yes, but they're saying it'll thankfully be over soon.
Yes.
But poor Henry…
Large open spaces are the worst since they show the most sky.
Yes, I can well imagine.
Then you practically have to drag him out.
He'll be fine here.
-It is incredibly kind of you. -Not at all.
It's the least we can do.
-Hey, you. -Say hello to Aunt Anna, please.
Good morning, Rigmor. Did you sleep well?
Is it because you saw those people who died in the burning car?
Is that why you stopped speaking?
Rigmor.
Let's only talk about happy things. Remember?
This is Wolle.
Some teddies find children constantly hugging them childish.
But Wolle doesn't mind.
-I have to catch the train. -Yes.
Make him use the notepad. It's really helpful.
Yes, of course.
Darling boy,
you'll be safe and happy here.
You'll have a wonderful time.
Will you look after Henry?
At school as well?
I spoke to the Sisters.
They look forward to having him.
I'll see you in a month's time, my sweet.
Okay?
Bye now.
Remember to say something.
All right. Off you go. Catch your train.
Bye, Mom.
Bye, my darling.
Bye, Henry.
Eva saw someone die too. He was shot in the head.
But you can still talk. Right, Eva?
-You have to say something to talk. -What do you want me to say?
See? She can talk even though she saw someone die.
Try it.
Just say something.
It's okay. You probably just have a frog in your throat.
-Might a bun help? -Oh no.
Come on.
It'll be dangerous.
You see, the problem is
that the truly frightening thing is that the Hippo lives in there.
Because the Death Witch lives inside the Hippo.
And her pointy fingers are made of the bones of dead children.
But that's not the worst thing.
Her eyes can burn holes so you must never meet her gaze.
Never!
But that's not the worst thing.
-The worst thing is… -The buns are poisoned.
-One bite will kill you. -One bite will kill you.
Come on.
You probably want to know why we want a lethal bun.
Rigmor has the antidote.
Wait up, Henry. -It might get a bit difficult now. -Yes.
-It might get a bit difficult now. -Yes. We're approaching a wide avenue with a lot of visible sky.
We're approaching a wide avenue with a lot of visible sky. It's a really wide avenue.
But we'll just do it like this.
We'll tie a clothesline around your waist, then I'll drag you.
-You just have to follow. -Yes.
That's how we reach the other side.
And Eva is right behind you too.
Come on, Henry. Come!
Come on.
-Eva, push him. -I'm pushing.
-Come on, Henry. -Come on.
We're almost there. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Come on, Henry. Eva, push him.
Come on. You can do it.
Come on.
Come on.
-Come on now. -Come on.
You made it!
-Yes, you did it! -Tomorrow, you can do it without the line.
Yes.
-No! -Are you crazy?
It's poisoned.
You have to dip it three times.
And then you hold it to Jesus.
Then you can eat it.
We survived!
HURRAY!
-Hurray! -Hurray!
There you are. Follow me. We're going on a trip. Come on.
This is my cousin Henry. He doesn't speak.
Right. Welcome, Henry.
Stop! Stop, you pig! Stop!
Stop!
-No. -Get away from me.
Come on, children. No, don't look. Don't look.
Just walk on. Come on. Walk. Don't look. Look the other way. Come on.
No, avert your eyes. You there, don't look.
Come on. We're leaving.
Ouch!
HIPO pig! You fucking HIPO pig!
Stay down. And stop when we tell you to.
Can I help you?
You're the Devil.
If you don't find God, you will burn.
What?
Teresa!
What on earth are you thinking, girl?
Traitor!
Dirty HIPO pig!
Frede, are you coming?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
Where are we?
At Vestre Prison?
No, we're at the Shell House.
The Shell House?
I walked up the stairs. I'm under the roof of the Shell House.
-Under the roof? -Yes, the roof.
We're in the cells. Under the roof.
Under the roof at the Shell House.
How many of us are there?
I don't know.
Thirty, maybe.
Forty.
We'll hopefully be transferred to Vestre Prison soon.
No.
No?
We're human shields.
An attack is imminent.
By the British?
Do you think they'll come?
Yes.
So we're expendable?
Yes.
But…
-How do you know for sure? -I was there.
When we decided.
-That the Royal Air Force would bomb us? -Yes.
And here you are, locked up here. Yes, that is admittedly a bit strange.
-Absurd. -Yes.
Absurd.
You! Stop.
Turn around.
You may pass.
What do you want? Tell me.
The other day,
you said something.
The thing about God.
I don't know what it meant.
-And it's too late. -What is too late?
The war is over.
I'm doomed.
-Well, that's a shame. -I don't want your pity.
What do you want, then?
You came to me and said I had to find God.
-He doesn't like black uniforms. -Your habit's black, isn't it?
What does God say about self-righteous virgins shunning the real world?
-I shouldn't talk to someone from HIPO. -No, I'm missing a halo.
I'm the Devil incarnate.
Kiss me.
What?
If I kiss someone like you, God will surely punish me.
Then I'll know He exists.
Kiss me.
No.
Well.
Hey.
No.
Lightning didn't strike me.
God does not exist.
You may pass.
As you know, our annual theater production is Elizabeth of Thuringia.
She lived in 13th-century Germany.
Although Elizabeth was of royal descent, she did everything in her power
to help the poor.
And then what happened?
Yes, Greta?
The rich, evil Jews didn't like that she was helping people.
One day, when she arrived with her basket of bread, the rich, evil Jews stopped her.
I don't think they were Jews.
But, other than that, you are correct.
And then what happened
when they wanted to see the contents of her basket?
Rigmor?
They turned into roses. God performed a miracle.
In order to help Elizabeth hide the bread, He turned the bread into roses.
Yes?
-Sister Hanna, do you have a minute? -Teresa, would you take over, please?
Yes, Rigmor?
How could bread turn into roses?
Well, that's what a miracle is.
There are numerous accounts
of statues of the Virgin Mary suddenly coming to life and weeping.
In Civitavecchia in Italy, sometimes she cries tears of blood.
And it is said that other Madonnas may even speak.
But how?
Because God can do anything.
-Always? -Yes.
Even when He is sleeping?
God never sleeps.
-How does He stay awake? -Well, sometimes…
Sometimes…
very rarely though…
something might distract Him.
And then Sister Teresa just told us to drop our pencils.
So we did, of course.
And then they laid there on the floor. Then we had to pick them up again.
Then Sister Teresa said something about
God's hours and minutes being entirely different from ours.
See? It took perhaps three seconds.
Three seconds where you didn't look at me because you were looking at the pencils. GOD LIVES GOD SLEEPS
God's hours, minutes, and seconds are entirely different from ours.
So, to God, a single day
may feel the same as 100 years.
Or, to God, a second may feel like a year.
So, if you glance away
for a couple of seconds,
then He's not there.
So, if God dropped a pencil, He looks away.
Then He's gone for two years.
Okay. And Sister Teresa said all that?
I'm just thinking that if we're really unlucky,
God may be taking a nap right now.
While we all exist.
And that might be for 100 years.
If it's a long nap, it may be even longer.
Teresa!
Oh, what's that?
What happened right there?
With the little muscles which you don't use so often?
Was that a smile?
So you do know how to smile.
SHE IS CRAZY
Yes, that's right. What does it say?
Me?
If anyone's crazy, it's you!
-You're definitely the crazy one, okay? -Yes.
I'm a Hawaiian nun called Henry.
I'm very fond of my niece, Rigmor,
who is both very nice and clever.
And her mom and dad are nice too,
because they say the war's over soon.
Which is lucky, because God just stepped out to buy some cigarettes.
-That's brilliant. Beautiful. Encore! -Bravo! Encore!
If you want an encore, take a look at this.
Henry, do try to keep up.
Hi, my name is Henry.
I can't talk,
but if Rigmor and I had a cookie each,
I'll be all cured.
No, no. It's time for bed, children.
-Bravo. -That was so good.
Sister.
What is it?
Did you kiss me because I'm the Devil?
Yes.
I don't want to be the Devil anymore.
Sister!
Teach me how to pray.
Here.
Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou…
Read it.
I can't read.
Repeat after me.
Hail Mary, full of grace. Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee. The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women. Blessed art thou among women.
And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Again.
Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with…
If you wanted to kiss the Devil, it should be here.
No. No, you can't. Not here.
No, stop.
Stop!
No, stop.
He spoke to us.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I'm such a bastard.
My name is Frederik.
Teresa.
I can't. Yes, you can.
I won't.
Stop it. Finish your breakfast. End of story.
But I don't feel well. There's nothing wrong with you.
-I'm not hungry. -You'll be hungry in a minute.
As soon as you leave. You can't go to school on an empty stomach.
I don't like it. Remember "The Story of Soup-Kaspar"?
He wouldn't eat either. Nope.
After four days, he was just skin and bones.
After five days, Kaspar was dead because he wouldn't eat his soup.
Dead.
Finish your food!
Fine. Off you go on an empty stomach.
Go on. Your porridge will be here when you get back. You'll eat it cold.
Wait! Wait for me!
What is it? Nothing.
-Where's Frederik? -I haven't seen him in two days.
I don't know what the Corps will do.
But it's over.
My son.
You're doomed once the liberation comes.
Goodbye, son.
Rigmor. Rigmor, what on earth are you doing?
I'm walking with my basket.
Yes, but just walk around a little, saying hello to people.
Then step forward, and speak to the audience.
-Fine. -Yes. Go on, then.
Rigmor, why aren't you stopping?
I thought I should go say hello to my old grandmother in the woods.
No, you shouldn't. We're not performing a fairy tale.
If you say so.
I am the beautiful Elizabeth of Thuringia.
There is famine and distress in this world.
My heart is broken. My faith is weak.
Little children die from hunger.
Tonight, I heard a calling, a sound.
"Elizabeth, my harbinger. I am the Lord, and this is the truth."
Who is it?
Open the basket.
Thank you.
Thank you, girls. That was lovely.
Eva, could you come down here, please?
What is wrong with you? Does your tummy hurt?
-Did you not have breakfast? -No.
Eva.
You can't survive without eating breakfast.
Well, off you go to the bathroom.
Yes, you can go too.
Did you find God?
Or do you prefer your HIPO pig?
I spoke to the Prioress.
Today's your last day at the school.
What you did is an abomination.
Try dipping your head. Maybe it will make you better.
It's the antidote.
Come on. Try it.
Help! Keys!
Let us out!
Give them to me!
Give them to me, goddammit! Let go!
Calm down. Let's go two-by-two. Come on now. Let's go.
-Calmly and quietly. -No running, girls. Nice and calmly.
Come on!
Go.
Calmly and quietly.
Get away from the stairs! Away!
Teresa!
Teresa!
Teresa!
Teresa!
Teresa!
Teresa!
Teresa!
Teresa!
-Teresa! -Teresa!
-Teresa! -Get down in the basement. Go.
Did you hurt your finger, sweetie? There you go.
It's okay. It'll grow back.
It'll grow back again.
-What's happening? -They're bombing the school.
-They're bombing the French school. -They're bombing the school.
Emma!
Go inside. Wait in the theater.
Has anyone seen Eva?
Eva?
Tell me, have you seen Eva?
-Did she come out? Did you see her? -No.
-Emma, you need to stay here. -Rigmor.
Stay here! Emma, stay! Listen to me now!
I'll find her! Okay? I'll find her.
-You need to find her. -I'll find them both.
Mommy!
-Hello? -Mommy!
Hello!
-Hello? -Mommy!
Help! There's someone down here! There's somebody here!
Mommy!
Hello! Is anybody there?
Hello!
Mommy!
Mommy.
Oh my God.
Help.
Here.
We found someone!
Okay.
Rigmor?
Greta?
Greta and Rigmor, are you there?
Are you there?
Sister?
Where are you, Rigmor?
Sister Teresa?
Yes. Where are you? I'm down here.
-How long do we have to stay here? -We need…
We just need to wait a while. Then somebody will come and get us.
Greta?
Greta?
Why isn't Greta answering?
Come on. Off you go. Come!
Go wait at the theater.
Hey! You there! Yes, you. Come over here.
Come here!
Hey! Hello!
Are you okay?
I need someone to write descriptions of each of the girls we rescue.
Give the descriptions to the lady at the theater
so that she can tell the parents whom we've rescued.
Can you do that?
How about that one? Can you write on that? Can you?
Great.
See that girl?
Do you see her? Blonde hair, green dress, yellow socks.
Eight years of age. Write it down. She's going to Frederiksberg Hospital.
Write that down too.
If they can talk, ask their names and write them down.
Then deliver the note. Got it?
Well done, boy. Off you go. Go!
She's conscious. Get her name. Run over to the theater with it.
Go on, goddammit! -We have to get moving. -What…
Wha…
What's your…
What's your name?
Your name? What…
What's your name?
What's your name?
What's your name?
Done? Great. Go.
What's your name?
What? You have to speak…
You have to…
-Louder. -Jenny.
How old are you?
Seven.
-What color is your dress? -Done.
Lift.
Rigmor?
Yes.
Can you see anything?
I can't see a thing.
But I can feel water rising up to my belly.
Water?
Are you lying on your stomach?
Rigmor?
Are you lying on your stomach?
Yes. There's a lot of water now.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
I'm going in.
Does anyone have a flashlight?
Here.
Eva?
Come on, everyone. All the parents…
-Did you find her? -No.
Follow me to the seats.
-Do we have to stay here? -Yes.
It's this way. Come into the theater.
-Would you please tell the parents… -Yes.
…where they've taken them. Thank you.
If we stay here, we'll get messages from the school
about the girls they've found
and where they're taking them.
There is a young girl.
She's seven.
Wearing a red dress.
She's going to Frederiksberg Hospital.
Her name is Jenny.
Jenny!
Well done, sweetie.
Hurry up and get some more messages, okay?
Then we have little Agnete, aged eight.
She's been taken to Frederiksberg Hospital.
Grey dress and red socks. Black hair.
Rigmor?
Rig… Come on. Follow me this way.
Help!
We're coming!
We're here!
We're on our way! We're coming!
Did you hear that, Rigmor?
Did you hear that?
Rigmor?
Are you there?
Are you there?
Yes.
Did you hear that? Someone's coming for us.
Someone's coming.
We're coming!
Rigmor.
Rigmor.
Rigmor!
Rigmor!
The water. It's rising.
The water's rising.
The water…
Can you still feel it beneath you?
It's almost up to my mouth now.
Could you lift your head? Can you?
But my mouth is already all the way up.
How?
How, Rigmor?
There's some iron going through my chin,
lifting up my head.
Through it?
Hel…
Help!
We're down here!
-We're here. -Hello!
We're here. Help us. Help. We're here.
The water's rising! Help!
Help! The water's rising!
Goddammit.
Goddammit to hell.
Read it!
Read it!
Can you read it? Just read.
Can you help me read this, please?
Blonde hair, eight years of age.
Yellow socks…
-Blue… -Louder.
Blonde, eight years of age, yellow socks, blue dress.
Nora!
Henry!
Oh my God!
Are you okay? Are you?
Did you see Rigmor?
Did you see her? Did you? No.
-I have to go… -Where is she?
Henry!
Sister Teresa?
Yes, Rigmor?
Do you think God dropped a pencil?
Yes, I do.
Do you think they'll be much longer?
Maybe.
I don't know.
And then, will we go to Heaven?
Yes.
We all will.
And is Jesus waiting for us?
Yes. He is.
He definitely is.
Yes. He is.
The basement's filling with water. They're drowning!
Hello?
The children are in the basement.
-What did you say? -They're in the basement.
-That's where we'll find most of them. -And the water?
-What about the water? -What about it?
Jensen!
Rasmussen!
Get the pumps.
Get all the pumps you can get your hands on. Now! Go!
-There's too much water rising. -Come on!
-Come on! -Come on!
We're coming!
Hello? Where are you?
Hello! We're here.
We're down here.
I have a hose to pump the water with. I'll try to get it to you!
Rigmor?
Rigmor?
Listen to me. I'm sending a hose down to you.
It'll pump away the water.
Do you hear me, Rigmor?
It'll make the water go away.
Rigmor?
Rigmor!
Rigmor!
Rigmor!
Rigmor!
Rigmor.
Rig…
We're so stupid.
I yelled at her.
I said she'd die.
It was the last thing I said to her.
Because she wouldn't eat her porridge.
Because she wouldn't eat.
I need some air.
You're the boy with the notes?
Do you have a note about Eva?
Eva? She's blonde.
Brown coat, gingham dress, yellow socks and gloves.
But Eva isn't here anymore.
What do you mean?
Why isn't she here anymore?
I think she went home.
ADULTS KILLED
CATHOLIC SISTERS
TEACHERS
And these are my toys:
the houses, the boats, the cars,
and the financial business that pays for it all.
[sighs] And this is me,
Akin Holloway.
The Holloway family has been Lagos royalty for generations.
I want to leave my kingdom to my daughters.
A "happily ever after" in marriage is gold.
[Akin] This one, I paid for her MBA,
[Akin] This one, I paid for her MBA, but she wants to be a marriage counselor.
I am Tokunboh Holloway.
[Akin] And this one: she might look a little bit wild.
-I am ready! -[girl] Right there!
[Akin] But she also thinks she's going to be ‎the biggest screenwriter in Nollywood.
But my life isn't about relaxing at the pool...
You're here?
It takes brains to hold on to all this wealth
because there's always someone ready to take everything away from you.
And there's always someone ready to spend it.
Everything about this dress.
[Akin] Meet my wife.
My party must be unrivaled in the land of Eko partydom...
the big boys and the inner caucus of the Lagos elite,
the custodians of Lagosian class,
the one percent of the one percent.
Baba, [chuckles] are you sure you're ready?
[Baba Eko, in Yoruba] See this, little child.
[in English] You don't have respecto.
[Akin] Sometimes, you don't realize things are about to fall apart...
and it starts with something really small...
-[laughs] She needs to be taught a lesson. -[Iris chuckles]
[Akin] ...like a game of tennis.
-[Akin] What kind of disrespect is that? -[Baba Eko] Greetings, sir. What?
-[Iris makes soothing sound] Baba. -Hm?
So, uhm, I want to go and take off all my clothes
and stand under the shower.
[Iris] Do you want to come with me? That is very important, eh?
-[in Yoruba] Don't be too long. -[Iris, in Yoruba] Don't worry!
-All right, Akin. -Sir?
This is my finger, bet it.
Yes, sir.
-You see that girl? -Yes, sir.
-Huh? This girl? -Yes, sir.
[in Yoruba] She will nearly die tonight.
[singing in Yoruba] ♪ She will nearly die tonight ♪ ♪ She will nearly die tonight ♪
[reverend] Oloye Alabi Ojo,
who peacefully transited to glory
after a short game of tennis, was above all...
a faithful husband and a good father, to the end.
Look at her lips,
-like a slit in the middle of her face. -[Kiki, disgusted exclamation]
All the foundation in the world and her wrinkles have wrinkles.
-[chuckles] -[Ngozi Gomez, in Yoruba] Devil.
She's coming, she's coming.
[woman] OK... Oh...
[Mopelola] You look beautiful, as usual. And Kiki, when did you come back?
-[Kiki] A week ago. -[Mopelola] Ah...
My deepest condolences.
Your mentor was a great man.
But you know, AMCON will soon be paying you a visit.
-[chuckles] -But the righteous are bold as a lion.
Righteous? [laughs]
Oh, come on, Akin.
Uh... Look, I am privy to your non-performing loans in billions of naira.
You know, they couldn't touch you because of Baba...
but now that he's gone... [laughs]
[stutters] be expecting them.
You know, you're right, Alhaji.
-Yeah. -Yes, you're right.
But some conversations are inappropriate where we come to honor the dead.
Ah... Yeah. Anyway. Uh... See you. Uh...
You have a good day.
[stutters] What did he want?
He brought up AMCON. How stupid of him to have done that.
But Akin, we have avoided that subject, uh, since Baba died.
We can't afford to anymore.
-[Akin sighs] I know, Grey. -Hm-mm.
-Hm? -[sighs] Let's go.
Kiki, pass me the wine, please, darling.
Wait a minute,
Okikiola Princewill,
these are not the breasts you left Lagos with.
God no, those were sagging balloons.
[Mopelola] Mm... But these are a magnificent work of art. -They look like A-class melons. -[woman exclaims in agreement]
-But I've told you ladies before... -What is it?
...that me and those Abuja slay-bitches
that want to keep taking our husbands in the Senate,
we will die there. [chuckles]
Plus, my dear Femi,
he has been rushing home every weekend to these awesome babies.
[women] Oh really?
Kiki, don't you think you have done
Kiki, don't you think you have done one too many of these cosmetic arrangements?
Yes, but the wonders of plastic surgeries.
I mean, it's amazing how they can turn an ugly duckling
I mean, it's amazing how they can turn an ugly duckling -into a swan... I mean, just like that. -[dishes clinking]
-into a swan... I mean, just like that. -[dishes clinking] What do you mean "ugly duckling"?
-[Mopelola stutters] -But you need some work done.
-[stutters] -Don't be jealous of me. All you need to do is ask, and I'll give you their contact.
All you need to do is ask, and I'll give you their contact. It's not that difficult.
Uh-huh! Besides...
these awesome babies have their benefits...
all day, every day.
-[Mopelola] Kiki, he's just a baby. -[women laughing]
-[indistinct speech] -[woman] Gosh!
Dunni, Dunni, Dunni, Dunni, Dunni, Dunni...
-Just look away, just look away. -[person clearing throat]
[Dunni] You people, huh!
[in Yoruba] Stop with the pretense. You people did not miss me.
[Kiki] How was your Scotland trip?
[Dunni] Uh, it was fine, yo.
I had mad fun.
Uh... I went to the, uhm... this place, Edibug.
It's pronounced "Edinburgh".
Edinbra?
-Edinburgh. -...bra?
[in Yoruba] Look, it's all the same.
[in English] I went on a shopping spree.
I bought Gooki.
-Gooki? -[Dunni] Yes. I bought Burberry.
-[Mopelola] Hm... -I bought LV.
-I bought, uhm... -[Mopelola] LV? -There's this one-- -Basically you just did mad shopping.
-There's this one-- -Basically you just did mad shopping.
Did you follow me?
[woman in Yoruba] This girl is a bastard.
[Dunni] Anyway,
if you have any party, make sure you call me.
-Of course. -You understand? Like that, your party of last year.
[in Yoruba] I will come and turn the place upside down. Spray money.
-The Caribbean themed party? -[women] Oh, yeah!
It was all right, I suppose.
All right? What are you talking about?
It was voted top Lagos party by Society Forbes.
Girl, now wait for my 50th, come next March.
I will be sure to send you an invite.
Oh? Not before I send you one for my 51st in October. Hm...
Where will that be?
Oh, Akin and I haven't decided yet. Somewhere different.
Maybe a cruise in Brazil. Or something like that.
-[women exclaim in surprise] -We'll make up our minds later.
[Dunni] Mm. Great, great combination.
[in Yoruba] Anyway, I'm hungry.
[in English] Server! -Jollof rice and moin-moin. -I think they have amala here.
-Jollof rice and moin-moin. -I think they have amala here. -I saw amala. -[Dunni] No, it's a class party.
-[Mopelola] Oh... That's natural. -[Dunni] Jollof rice.
From now on, no unwarranted purchases.
We have to lay low. No noise.
[Grey] Hm... Good idea, that's a good one.
[Akin] That's the best way to go about it, as far as I'm concerned, if you ask me.
Uncle AK. Congratulations.
I can't wait to be at Aunty's turn up this year.
What's that?
[scoffs] Uncle, you need to be woke. Turn-up is a party!
Yes, I know, we're not having any.
But I overheard Aunty telling her friends -that we're having a party this year. -Hm-mm?
[in Yoruba] This woman will not ruin my life.
Fifty-first birthday party! Who does that... Mope?
Oh, for goodness sake, Akin. [in Yoruba] Leave me alone.
-[in Yoruba] I should leave you alone? -[scoffs]
After your news has traveled half across the world.
Well, I wasn't talking to the world. I was talking to Oge.
And if the news has gotten out
that I'm going to have another fabulous party next year,
frankly, it's no fault of mine.
I totally forgot you're not one to be reasoned with.
I can be reasoned with if you upgrade your IQ to the level where I can be persuaded.
if you upgrade your IQ to the level where I can be persuaded.
[in Yoruba] Me?
[scoffs] Look, you know what?
I'm staying back at the hotel, after my meeting.
Oh, thank you, honey.
More space for me in the bed. And certainly no snoring.
[driver] Oga, Madam. Will you like some music from this radio?
-[in Yoruba] Shut up! -My friend, you look at what you're doing!
-[Akin] Music ko, Beat FM ni. -[Mopelola] Twat.
[Akin] Who is it?
[Kaima] Edible catering.
So...
it has to take a fight with Mopelola to get you to stay here?
Come here...
So, did you miss me?
Of course I did.
Wait, Mommy is throwing a birthday party this year?
OK, Daddy, I know that you called thinking I would be upset with Mommy too,
but you know that this apple didn't fall too far from the tree.
Yes, I'll be in her corner.
OK, Daddy. Bye. [chuckles]
[George] What?
Mommy is throwing a party for her 51st birthday.
Why am I not surprised?
George, you...
You know that...
we haven't done anything together in a long time
and planning Mommy's birthday party would help us get back on track
and planning Mommy's birthday party would help us get back on track and be awesome again.
Right. I'm... I'm going to be late. I have to beat traffic.
You forgot your ring.
Right.
Have a safe flight.
-[on TV] You! Give me back my love! -[phone ringing]
Hello. Demidun.
Mommy is throwing another birthday party?
Typical of your mother.
She's more interested in throwing a big birthday party with everything that is going on
to show that she's the socialite of the year.
Yeah, I'm at my meeting.
[scoffs] As in I am watching this God-awful movie.
My brain actually hurts.
[scoffs] OK. Bye, sis.
It's like you don't like the film.
Sorry, your voice was so loud.
Forgive me for making it easy for you to eavesdrop.
Are you waiting for somebody?
Apparently not.
I have no better use of my time than sitting down here
and losing precious brain cells to a Nollywood travesty.
-[laughs] -Excuse me, hi.
Please, do you work here?
I have been waiting for five minutes.
[receptionist] Oh! I am so sorry. The receptionist on duty actually called in sick,
-so I took-- -Can we just skip to the part
where I see Mr. Nnamdi Agwu?
I have a meeting with him, and I have been waiting for more than five minutes.
This is the Mr. Nnamdi Agwu here,
our CEO.
It is I, Nnamdi Agwu, CEO, Ebubedike Pictures International.
[laughs] You must be...
-Tokunboh Holloway? -Tokunboh.
Oh, the scriptwriter.
-The screenwriter, yes. -I have been waiting for you.
Let us go to my office where you can tell me more about this travesty.
[Kaima exclaims sensually] You know, I could get used to this.
With him, it's... it's just two minutes.
And twice a month, if I'm lucky.
But with you...
Akin...
please take me on a holiday.
You know that's not going to happen.
Why not?
We'll travel separately.
We'll arrive at the same spot.
It'll be magical.
It would be foolish.
-Foolish? -Hm...
But Akin, we are both married to the wrong people.
My husband is a sorry case...
-and, and your wife, Mopelola, she-- -[Akin, in Yoruba] Shut up!
[in English] Don't you ever mention my wife again,
especially as long as she is Mrs. Holloway.
Never ever compare yourself to her.
Sweetheart, please come and go.
Sweetheart, please come and go. Please.
Now, look, I have enough issues as it is on my own...
and I can't add you to it.
[Nnamdi] Nne, everybody says you're the best.
That's really kind of them.
You see, this is my first cinema film.
I want it to be tough!
I totally get you on that one.
You're shaking. It's like you are nervous.
Do you want me to call my assistant to get you something to drink, something that will help you calm your nerves?
to get you something to drink, something that will help you calm your nerves?
Awesome. Scotch or vodka will be perfect for me.
No, no, no. Nne. That is alcohol.
No, no, no. Nne. That is alcohol. It is too early in the day for alcohol.
You know what, never mind. Please forgive me.
This isn't me at all. It's that time of the month.
[stutters] PMS?
No, my village people. They're tweeting everything that I'm saying.
I like that. I like this one. You're funny.
Either way, just disregard everything that I've said before now.
If you give me a chance, I would actually prove myself to you,
-and I would do better. -No, no, no, no, no.
My dear, I like you the way you are.
I like people that are very real.
-[laughs, in Igbo] You understand? -Yeah.
What you said to me downstairs, I love it.
-If you like what I did yesterday... -Hm-mm?
...that means you cannot help me get to where I'm going to tomorrow.
I have conquered Asaba.
Look behind me. All of these are my awards.
This one here: Certificate of Market of Excellency.
The whole market people gather and gave me award.
-Fantastic. -This one here is
a certificate of achievement,
given by the Aba Boys' Clan Worldwide Global International.
-Fantastic. -All of this place here is award.
-Woman, you know what I want to do now? -Hm-mm?
I want to break into the Lagos market. Cinema.
As I'm talking to you right now,
‎-I have about four investors... ‎-Oh. Really?
...that are ready to drop 50 million naira, cash!
Fifty million? -Yes. -Wow.
All they want from me is to, is to give them a... a blockbuster.
All they want from me is to, is to give them a... a blockbuster. -Epic! That is where you come in. -Yeah. OK. OK.
-Epic! That is where you come in. -Yeah. OK. OK.
I want you to write something down for me.
Something that is going to, you know, shake everybody.
Trust me, shaking people is kinda like my forte.
I know that you and me together, we are going to create magic.
-Let me call my assistant. Cold Coke. -Yeah. I will take that Coke now.
[Shaggy] Chukwuemeka and the fishpond! Great man! [chuckles]
Good day, sir. Good morning.
-How are you, Shaggy? -I'm fine, sir.
Sir, I just want to say the food is ready, and the table is set,
and the table is set, with a variety of dishes.
[in Pidgin] Your family is already seated at the table.
[in Pidgin] They want to start enjoying the food... [in Pidgin] but are waiting for you to come.
Thank you, Shaggy.
All right, sir.
Is there anything else?
I don't want to say much.
I just wanted to say you look fine, and you are looking agile. White lion!
White lion!
And I also pray that God will always grant you good health.
And I also pray that God will always grant you good health. -I also want to... -Thank you, Shaggy.
-I also want to... -Thank you, Shaggy. wish you happy Christmas in arrears.
-Thank you, Shaggy. -Thank you, sir.
Thank you. God bless you.
-Hey. -Huh-uh.
How did it go?
It did not go well. You should have gone with me.
It did not go well. You should have gone with me. Overseas, they say,
"Behind every successful man is a successful woman."
Since you did not go with me, I could not say anything.
-You didn't say anything there? -I didn't.
When we need your manliness, it doesn't show up.
All you do is joke around like a comedian.
Forget that. If you had gone with me, I would have been motivated.
Let us go and cuddle so that--
Get out of here!
Cuddling is not for poor people.
What? Who is poor?
Don't you know I am talented?
Don't you know I am talented? -What talent? -I am talented! I am a future rich man!
-What talent? -I am talented! I am a future rich man!
What future? You are old!
Not much future left for you!
Don't laugh. This doesn't concern you.
My future is over, right?
You haven't heard me sing.
Come let me give you one track.
I don't want to get pregnant in poverty!
I'm not getting you pregnant. Let me give you one track.
All right. Give it to me.
Get out of here.
-I am not done. -What are you finishing?
I don't want a poor musician. I want Lil Wayne.
Yup. Actually, a thriller.
What I really want,
you know, is chance to do something like my favorite show ever: -Game of Thrones. -Yeah.
-That would definitely-- -[Mopelola] There will be no talk
of Nollywood movies at this table.
An Oxford-trained lawyer turned Nollywood scriptwriter
is not something we are going to celebrate in this household.
Mommy, this is your last chance.
-Hm-mm. -Either accept what I do for a living,
or I will cancel your name from my Oscar acceptance speech.
-I'm so bothered. -[laughing]
Anyways, uhm, I'll jump straight to the reason why I called this meeting.
[in Yoruba] What is it?
-They should excuse us? -I want to talk with them.
Yes.
Move! Out! Be sharp.
-[in Yoruba] You too! -Me too? OK.
Sorry. Madam, please,
anytime you need me, or you need me to clear the plates,
-please call me. -[Mopelola] Yes. -I'll be in the kitchen. -[Mopelola] Yes, Aunty Joy. Thank you.
-I'll be in the kitchen. -[Mopelola] Yes, Aunty Joy. Thank you.
-Thank you. -Thank you. [Akin] Well, like I was saying,
there are rumors around town that, uhm, our company is being hit by hard times.
And all I can say is that I'm on top of it.
But you see, at this particular point in time,
I need us all to keep our heads down.
Because what we do or say at this time
will decide if we sink or if we survive.
Needless to say, we're the Holloways.
To some of you, it might just be a surname,
but to this city,
it is a monument from the times of Pa Dehinde Holloway.
All the generations of the Holloways have made sure...
that they did good by the Holloway name.
So I'll be damned to be the one to change the status quo.
Quite right.
Daddy, we're talking about keeping a low profile,
and at the same time, planning Mommy's party.
-To me, that's like-- -Aha!
-I was coming to that. -Excuse you?
[in Yoruba] Mope, be patient.
[in English] Now...
I deeply feel-- [Mopelola] No. Wait, wait, wait.
Is this some kind of disguised intervention?
Oh, so you and the children planned this in order to twist my arm
so I that I won't have my 51st birthday,
-is that what it is? -[girls] No, it's actually not like that--
Oh, shut up, you dingbats.
Do I look like some kind of spring chicken that will fall for this... badly scripted hypocrisy?
that will fall for this... badly scripted hypocrisy?
Uh, Mommy, you actually look like a spring chicken.
-[in Yoruba] What did you say? -No, it's a compliment.
I will slap the black off your face, you silly little girl.
How dare you? No, really, Akin.
-[in Yoruba] Don't be upset. -Who the hell do you think you are?
-What's wrong with you? -Who does she think she is? Rude child. -I didn't mean any-- -[Akin] Out!
To the pool house. Now!
I didn't mean any harm. And take off that damn costume.
-[soothing sounds] -You look like a bloody masquerade.
Calabar masquerade!
-[soothing sounds] Let it be. -Mom, it's OK. She didn't mean it.
You need to talk to your sister. She's really growing wings.
Excuse me. I'll talk to her.
Butterfly thinking she's an eagle. Who the hell does she think she is? I raised her.
Who the hell does she think she is? I raised her.
[Akin] Tokunboh...
No, but seriously, seriously,
[in Yoruba] you can't disrespect your mother like that.
Daddy, you know I didn't mean any harm. You know. You know how she is.
-That woman. -She's coming. She's coming. Behind you.
-[playful music playing] -Look, like I told you,
if it was my mother, she would have slapped the taste out of your mouth.
What nonsense.
But you know, I don't blame you. I don't blame you at all.
It's because I sent you to school abroad.
I'm really sorry, Dad. I'm sorry.
Mom, I'm sorry for what I did. I was highly disrespectful,
and I won't do it again. I'm sorry, Ma. Please, I'm sorry.
Go back inside the house, my friend.
[Akin] Mope...
Sweetheart, sorry.
Honestly, it wasn't a set-up.
Hm? But on a serious note...
Huh? Your 50th cost one million dollars.
Hm-mm? This is your 51st, it will be higher.
Well, naturally.
Huh? That means we're telling people to go and do what they bloody hell like.
Akin, my husband, you are a Lagosian.
I don't know if it's in the air or something in the water,
but there is something about this city that makes you live on the edge.
And no matter the trials or tribulations that come with it,
we cannot fall, Akin.
We can't. It's not possible now.
You see, between you and I, my love,
that is a wonderful pitch.
But I can't sell it to AMCOM.
They will show...
and when they show, they will take over the company.
And Baba Eko will not be there to help us.
We are this close, this close, to losing St. Ives.
And when we lose the company, what becomes of us?
OK, fine. Fine, Akin.
Eko Hotel instead of dinner on the yacht.
Our courtyard instead of Eko hotel.
Low publicity instead of none at all.
Private invite. No press.
But we have to do Thanksgiving at the Church of Assumption now.
[in Yoruba] This woman.
[sighs] I will call Jagaban and see if he'll show.
That's better, my little schmukum. [kissing sounds]
Akin...
you say you have this under control.
-Tell me the truth, Akin, are you? -[in Yoruba] God is my witness.
-Absolutely. -[phone rings]
[Grey] Well, not absolutely.
[Akin laughs] This is new, you doubting me.
Give me a reason not to, Akin. What strategy is in place?
What plan? Remember... "Thou shalt not steal."
What?
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
Your temerity is quite misplaced, my friend.
Remember, I'm your CEO.
Well, first, I'm your friend, Akin.
The board members are not.
They are investors who want their books in the black.
Since you're tending towards red,
the investors are meeting this morning to declare bankruptcy.
[Akin] We can't.
We shouldn't.
This is St. Ives Towers, for God's sake.
You should have thought of that before.
My father will turn in his grave. And if his turning cannot save us,
-let him go ahead and spin. Who cares? -[woman] Thank you!
Look, we have been very irresponsible with the fortunes of this company.
Instead of planting our seeds, we ate them.
Now the chicken has come home to roost.
I say we file immediately.
It is better to be seen as a laughingstock in the corporate world
than for the banks to close in on us.
-[woman 1] I concur. -[man 1] Hear, hear. -[woman 2] Yeah. -[man 2] Hear, hear.
[man 3] I concur with what he said.
Give me time.
We can't give what we don't have.
Besides, you have houses in [stutters] Fiji Islands, Mauritius, Spain.
All over the world, and you're asking for time?
-[indistinct speech] -The management retreat is next week.
Look guys, I know we're living on the edge here,
but I've done this long enough
to know that at the eleventh hour
there's always a miracle that turns the tide.
-[everybody laughing] -[man] What is this man talking about?
[man] What eleventh hour?
Prayer warrior, well done.
-[woman] Are you for real? -[Akin] Listen, guys...
if nothing happens before the retreat...
then we'll file for bankruptcy.
[Kaima] Are you OK?
[sighs] I thought I told you I could fix this.
[softly] Come.
Look, even Wedding Today did a center piece on us
-for Mommy's birthday party thing. -I know, baby.
And it's still the undisputed standard for fashion couple goals.
We absolutely have to retain our spot.
Uh-uh! You have to exceed it.
[hysterical laugh] Your head is there.
-Confession... -OK.
-watching you and George at the party... -Hm-mm.
...made me want to get married.
-Really? -Yeah, I mean, you looked so happy.
[gasps] I wanted it so bad.
-[shy laugh] OK, confession... -Hm-mm.
[sighs] ...I am so blessed.
I am so happy. Can't you see the smile on my face?
I see it. Ah!
Speaking of, I have to call him. I'll be right back.
Speaking of, I have to call him. I'll be right back. OK, baby.
Hello, love, my sweetheart, my darling.
Hey.
[clicks tongue] Baby, I miss you. I can't wait see you.
I have so much planned for Mommy's birthday party.
You are going to absolutely love it.
Uhm, uhm... Excuse me. Mind if I call you back?
I'm actually in the middle of something.
Oh, come on, let me be a part of your day now.
I miss the love of my life.
I understand, but, uhm...
[woman] Is that your wife?
Are... Are you not alone?
I have to run, all right? I'll talk to you later. Bye.
Oh, my goodness.
George is amazing, and once again, he has done it.
He's planned a trip for us to go to the Seychelles.
-[screams] You're so lucky. -[laughs]
[Demidun] Oh! I'm so blessed. I'm so blessed.
You know the one I'm most looking forward to?
Mrs. Savage's daughter's wedding. Now that will be something.
Yours truly has gotten her VVIP invitation,
complete with [laughs] a bracelet inside.
[Dunni] Huh-uh. Baba Lihad, please. If it is not Pasuna, then I don't want any other person.
-I wasn't the big boss of Fuji. -[indistinct speech]
Please don't make excuses,
and don't make me look like a liar in the presence of everybody.
[in Yoruba] Get off the phone! My friends!
How does she always manage to sniff us out though?
[Dunni] Hey! Are you all right?
Let me give you one gist.
[in Yoruba] As the wife of Suraju the fish seller,
AKA Ayinde,
they want to give me the title "Fashionista of Oniru".
[chuckles] Dunni, that's impossible.
What's impossible? What's ridiculous?
[in Yoruba] See, look at this. Tada!
"Fashionista of Oniru".
[Oge] Dreaming.
What? What?
[Oge] Dunni?
This is a travesty.
You people always think it's easy to be a fashionista.
[in Yoruba] I have always been a fashionista.
Anyway, let's leave that one aside. [in English] Let's leave that one, please come.
What's this funny rumor I'm hearing about this, our friend, Mopelola?
-That one. -Yes, I heard that... [stutters]
[in Yoruba] How do you say this in English?
[in English] Anyway, I heard that they are in a billion-dollar debts.
No, it's billion naira, I heard.
Listen, the bank is about to foreclose on St. Ives.
[Ngozi] You're kidding me.
Their househelp even told my househelp.
So my househelp now told me that they have not paid them salaries... -for months. -I won't be surprised.
-for months. -I won't be surprised.
-[indistinct speech] -Well, anyway.
[laughs] Me, I cannot invite such people to my party.
My party is not for the masses. -[laughs] -[indistinct speech]
I repeat, my party is not for the masses.
Only for people of your class. -Only for the people of my caliber. -I'm telling you. I'm telling you.
-Only for the people of my caliber. -I'm telling you. I'm telling you.
[Mopelola] My party must be unrivaled in the land of Eko partydom,
and with even more splendor than my 50th.
The big boys and the inner caucus of the Lagos elite,
the custodians of Lagosian class,
the one percent of the one percent.
Frankly, anyone who hasn't received an invitation should sit back and reassess
their reason for being on this planet in the first place.
Now, is there anything you don't understand?
Any questions?
Mrs. Holloway...
-Hm? -...I'm way ahead of you already.
Very good.
-Shall we begin? -Indeed.
Now, I would like to use the courtyard.
No, no, no. No, I'm thinking interior for this one.
Oh? But is the space large enough?
You mean, your palatial mansion? Of course it is.
-I'm thinking Nigerian paradise. -[impressed exclamation]
The gods of old. It's electric, Sango... And you...
my beautiful goddess, will be Yemoja, coral everywhere.
Let's see, what do we have here?
Ah! I love this.
Drums over here, greenery on the walls, and your family, my darling,
Drums over here, greenery on the walls, and your family, my darling, -will fit right there. -[Mopelola] Hm...
And over here... Mm... We will have the band.
-Well, I was thinking-- -Apologies... Apologies, Mrs. Holloway,
you can't interrupt it when the room is telling me what it wants to become.
Blue.
The ceilings, the walls, it's reminiscent of a tranquil environment.
Something like a seaside that'll be sure to steal the show.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This is my party.
Nothing animate or inanimate -should steal the show. -[chuckling]
-So therefore-- -And flowers...
cascading down the walls, an orchid wall over here.
Get Adela on the phone immediately.
It's going to be... Think an Oyo and a Benin Empire merger.
It's culture, it's spicy, but still... very classy.
-I like that. -[Venya] Of course you do.
So make sure all the decorators have all the information.
I'll forward you the logistics of the event.
And, uhm, should we be expecting an advance by check?
Oh! Commence immediately. I'll be sending you the advance shortly.
[chuckles] Yes, uh, yes, Ma, but, uhm...
I just need a date to put on, just for the books.
[scoffs] Am I sensing a recession in trust here, Venya?
Since when?
-[scoffs] -[Venya] Leave.
[in Yoruba] Mother, Aunty Mopelola, huh-uh...
[in Yoruba] Mother, Aunty Mopelola, huh-uh... [in English] But you know your boy is always loyal.
[in Yoruba] But you know how the country is right now.
[clicks tongue] Commence, Venya.
If the word of Mopelola Holloway does not hold water,
then frankly, I don't know why we're having this business discussion.
Sorry, Aunty. I'll make the order right away.
-Hm-mm. -And we'll make history,
like we did last year.
-Mm... I like the sound of that. -Of course, Ma.
-Mm... I like the sound of that. -Of course, Ma. Uhm, but I have to be going. I'll see you next week.
Oh, oh. One more thing. [clears throat]
Not a word to the press.
Not even one single picture on your Instagram page. Nothing.
The preparations for the party this year are going to be very quiet.
[stutters] Of course, in line with being exclusive.
Yes, Ma, I understand.
I'm going to go now, OK? It's good to see you.
[sighs] Move!
[in Yoruba] Mama... Mr. Holloway wants to see you.
[Iya Oloja, in Yoruba] Let him come in...
and leave us alone.
[Akin inhales, in Yoruba] Good evening, Ma.
Get up.
Wash your hands and eat.
[Akin] The governor...
your son...
[in English] he didn't answer my calls, and he didn't return any of my calls.
[in Yoruba] We didn't vote the governor in to talk to people.
[in English] He has the state to run.
[in Yoruba] For God's sake, Ma.
[in English] I need your help.
[in Yoruba] The business is almost in ruins.
For how long, Akin? You ran to Baba Eko.
For five years...
he persuaded your creditors to give you time.
Now you want the governor's help.
When are you going to grow into that man your father raised you to be?
[in Yoruba] Look here...
we all have problems.
We won't leave ours to solve other people's problems.
[Akin] Ma...
[in Yoruba] My directors and I have a meeting this weekend. And we are going to discuss the whole time the progress of this company.
And we are going to discuss the whole time the progress of this company.
Please help me.
[in English] Just two years, I'll pay everybody that I owe.
[in Yoruba] Please, for God's sake, help me.
[in Yoruba] The Yorubas say,
"A good name is better than gold and silver."
Your name is important to me...
so I will do something.
[in Yoruba] Thank you, Ma.
[in English] I love you.
[Iya, in English] But... it won't end well for you.
[in Yoruba] I'm not cursing you.
You are like a child to me.
[in English] But I need you to understand that you are your own problem.
[in Yoruba] You need to wake up to your heritage.
[in English] Otherwise... you stand the danger of losing it.
[Akin] Mope, can you hear me?
[Mopelola] Yes darling, I can hear you.
I got the invoice for your party in the mail.
Oh, he sent it. Good boy.
[in Yoruba] The one who paid my bride price. You're the best.
[stutters] Don't call me names.
We agreed that this is a courtyard affair now.
How can it get up to one million dollars?
[scoffs] So we should disgrace the family, Akin,
just because we decided to have the party on home ground?
Mope, you don't understand. We are being watched.
But I thought you said Iya Oloja had bought us a few more years.
Irrespective. I can't afford it.
So my day should be ruined?
Huh-uh. Look, even me, myself, I'm not spending money or anything like that.
I'm on a lean budget.
I don't buy anything useless.
-[salesman] Welcome, sir, to Mercedes-- -Shh.
[in Yoruba] Sweetheart, for God's sake, let's manage what we have.
One hundred million naira, that's all I'm going to do.
[surprised gasp] Akin, that's too small now.
Just make it half a million dollars.
Half a million dollars is not nearly enough! One hundred and fifty million naira and not a penny more!
[scoffs] Well, OK, OK. I'll manage it.
Half-bread is better than none, I suppose.
-[both in Yoruba] Bye. -Bye to you too.
My brother...
You're welcome, sir, to the Mercedes-Benz center.
Yes. So, how is this car better than my old S-class?
[salesman] Much better than the previous model. S-560. I mean, this is the S-560.
Seventy-eight million, that's the best we can do, sir.
-I'll take it. -Interestingly, sir, also...
[Mopelola, in Yoruba] Give me the blue and white one.
Hm-mm. Thank you.
[scoffs] Iya Moruf. [Iya Oloja, in Yoruba] Oh, God.
This one, fine. Go. Hm-mm.
-You know, nothing beats Swiss lace. -Oh!
I will be right with you.
[in Yoruba] What beats this one now?
-With your skin tone, it is final! -[satisfied exclamations]
[in English] In the whole Africa, -international worldwide market... -Mm?
[in Yoruba] ...I am the only one that has it.
-You're the only one that has it? -Ahaha!
So that means I'll be the only one wearing it.
-[in Yoruba] Only one. -I want it.
-But wait, wait. Do you have it in white? -Hm?
With those, uhm... the crystals they embellish them with. AB crystals.
Me? Huh-uh.
Me! Alhaja Sikirat Abeni, Mother of Moruf.
Hold on. I will be back.
I trust you. [chuckles]
[Joy and Shaggy, in Yoruba] Greetings, Ma.
[in Yoruba] Yes. What is it?
-You're busy. We'll come back... -Speak.
[in English] OK. Thank you, Ma.
[in Yoruba] We don't mean to bother.
We just thank you for everything.
The Igbos say, "The bearer of kola nuts brings joy."
-Not that we brought kola nuts but-- -[shushing]
[in English] Is there a point to all this rambling?
[in English] There is a point to the rambling. The way he talks. But Madam... [chuckles]
The way he talks. But Madam... [chuckles]
He just doesn't know how to get to it.
Madam, we... All of us, your workers, we love you,
and we are entrapped.
And we thought we shouldn't hide it from you,
that we need our salaries to escape the bondage.
How could you be so insensitive?
Madam, we didn't bring any insecticide.
Here I am, stressed out from organizing my 51st birthday party,
and then you bring up the matter of your salaries.
Well, it's fine. It's fine.
If you choose to be oblivious to the fact
that our monies are tied up in several business concerns...
-[stutters] And... -[Joy] Madam, you are crying.
-Madam, don't cry. -Madam, please don't cry.
We decided not to treat you like we're...
You are too emotional.
-Madam. -One big...
happy family.
We are all one big family. [in Yoruba] You know I am emotional too.
[Shaggy] How much is the money anyway?
And then you cry...
What am I supposed to say?
How much is the salary?
Madam, thank you. [in Yoruba] What do we need it for anyway?
We can come back.
What do you want...
Yes, come back.
Should I come and collect it this evening?
Iya Moruf, where is the--?
-[Iya Oloja] Customer, this is it. -Oh!
[in Yoruba] With the silvery head tie, not so?
-I think so. -Are you doubting it?
-[Joy] What kind of nonsense is that? -[Shaggy] Calm down.
-[Joy, in Yoruba] I will tell them. -[Shaggy] Calm down.
[in Yoruba] Everybody, come out. We are back from the meeting.
Come out. I like that you have chosen me as your spokesperson.
There's good news. I told madam in strong terms to give us our salaries.
I told madam in strong terms to give us our salaries. You understand me? I said-- I told Madam, "Madam,
You understand me? I said-- I told Madam, "Madam,
[stutters] where's the advance on our salaries?
-Give us our salaries now!" -[everyone talking together]
[in Yoruba] That's a lie. That's not what he did.
He was scared of Madam.
[man] Hm-mm? It is me who stayed there, and confronted her.
I was the one that spoke up about salary.
-[in English] Give us our money. -[all] Yes!
That is when Madam entered the "rich also cry" tempo.
She said, "You people put insecticide in my eye."
[Shaggy, in Yoruba] It was the crying that disarmed me.
[Joy] He pitied madam and started crying. What?
If you had seen it, you would have cried too.
[in Yoruba] I am tired! [in English] I need my salary.
[in Yoruba] And anything I can't get physically,
I'll get spiritually.
[in English] And I want to pray. If you want to join me, hold hands.
[Joy] You will say after me, "Oh Lord."
[everyone] Oluwa.
-Oh Lord. -[together] Oluwa.
What is the Oluwa you're saying?
What? Oluwa and Oh Lord, don't they mean the same thing?
Is God Yoruba? He doesn't understand Yoruba!
-[in Yoruba] I love it. -You do?
-[in Yoruba] I love it. -[giggling]
I knew that hiring you would be the best decision of my life. [shrieks] I was so nervous, Nnamdi.
[shrieks] I was so nervous, Nnamdi.
-About this? -Yes.
No! See this, your story? My mother will enjoy it.
It's also something that my brothers in Alaba and Idumota will enjoy.
I can't begin to tell you how relieved I am.
Relieve yourself. You have done very well.
Uhm, but... Your soup...
-it is sweet already. -Hm...
But there is a small ingredient that we'll just add, you know, to... to...
to thicken the plot.
All right, I'll put that in mind when I'm doing the outline.
[stutters] But I have some ideas
[stutters] But I have some ideas that I want to pour.
OK, I'm all ears. Go on, let me take notes.
Good.
-You see this, your king here, King Agwu? -Yes.
-Let us make him have two sons. -Fantastic.
-Very irresponsible idiots... -I love that.
-...Aki and Pawpaw. -What?
Oh yes,
then let us find something for Mr. Ibu.
Maybe, village palm wine tapper.
Then we'll find, uhm... Mama G.
We can make Mama G a perpetual beggar.
By the time we add all these people inside this soup...
[in Yoruba] Woman.
It is World Bank that'll be calling us to give us money.
Wait, Nnamdi, you are not joking?
No. You don't like my idea?
Look, Nnamdi, I am glad that I am working with you,
and I'm stoked that I'm about ‎-to do something great, ‎-Ah-ha...
but pardon me if I say that these, your ideas...
there's no... there's no nice way to put it.
Put it how it's doing you in your heart.
They are crap.
-Huh? -Yes!
Do you know these people that you are talking about?
-Hm-mm. -Ibu? Ozokwo?
Aki and Pawpaw? These are juggernauts of the east.
Movers and shakers of Asaba.
But not for this movie.
But this is their kind of movie now. Powerful epic. -Blockbuster-- -No! This is a revenge thriller.
-Blockbuster-- -No! This is a revenge thriller.
Not a slapstick with village actors.
By the time these guys go in that is exactly what it's going to become.
Woman, we need to put to comedy.
People need to laugh. The country is hard. [in Yoruba] Things are hard in this country.
It needs an element of comedy. It should not become comedy.
[Nnamdi sighs] Toku...
I can hear you.
I see where we have our difference.
-It's very clear. -Hm...
You want to win [stutters] an Oscar.
-Of course. -Me, I just want to pack money. Money!
It is very clear to me that there is a conflict of interest here.
Maybe another writer will accept your terms. But not me.
Toku, you don't want to write my blockbuster?
It is no longer a blockbuster.
This is a joke that every critic will tear down.
I, Tokunboh Holloway, will not be associated with such.
-You will get a text shortly. -What do you want to say?
Not from me... from your bank,
alerting you that I have returned your advance.
Toku...
But you have been advanced, Venya.
Only a quarter of the fees, Mrs. Holloway,
and now we are dipping into the company purse.
Empty the purse if you have to.
But never insinuate a lack of faith in being squared for your services.
Nothing of the sort, Mrs. Holloway, but if the flowers are going to be here on time,
we need to fly them in express.
We still have not settled on the caterer, the ushers, the band,
even the last bits of décor.
I mean, all due respect, Mrs. Holloway,
but any concessions I could make, given your standing, I can't make anymore
because there is no media. Everything is hush.
I'm afraid we cannot commence without adequate remuneration, Ma.
I'll send you a check, Venya.
Ma, it's Saturday. So?
So, I can't cash the check.
Do you think you can make a transfer, Ma?
Send me your account details.
I'll have my husband do a transfer to you. [clicks tongue]
Sure thing.
[sighs] I hate... broke people.
‎TOKU? PLEASE
Akin, I am tired.
You know what I say about things like this, Kaima.
I am not leaving him.
One second.
[watch dealer] Excuse me, sir,
this is a Rolex Day Date,
president bracelet, ever rose gold,
chocolate dial.
I'm a Holloway. I want something more limited edition.
Do you have anything Cartier?
Yes, of course. We have a Cartier, uhm, Diamond,
which is dragon dial on an alligator leather strap.
Oh, fantastic. I'll have that one.
OK. Thank you, sir.
Are you buying a watch?
Aren't you supposed to be piping down to avoid AMCON snipers?
We have two to three years.
But isn't that what got you there in the first place?
Look, Kaima, will you call me when this sanctimonious spell passes?
No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm sorry. I want to see you.
Kaima, you know what? Why don't you take some days off,
get a room at, uh, Wheatbaker, full-service luxury?
I got you some diamonds from Pierre.
Fantastic diamonds, I'm sure you'll like them.
So, Sunday night it is?
And then we can resume your nifty bedroom--
What did you call it?
You know, for a stiff upper lip,
you, my darling, are the sweetest man on earth.
Goodnight, Kaima.
Look at, uh, these people here, huh? Look at them.
What are they watching?
Old, young.
My tribe, your tribe.
[in Yoruba] Muslim, Christian, everyone.
[in English] That is my market.
I like your idea.
Don't get me wrong.
But let us not forget that, uh, this is Nigeria.
We are still Nigerians.
So, if you don't like my idea,
[in Yoruba] then refine it with your magic...
[in English] and make it sweet.
I want all these people here
to come to the cinema to watch our film.
And if these people don't come to the cinema,
the movie will find... [indistinct speech] its way to this TV.
[in Igbo] Please, dear.
[in Yoruba] Toku please, [in English] help me to make this film.
Toku,
I'm too young to be sent back to the village.
No girl will want to marry a failed Nollywood marketer.
-[chuckles] -Please, help me.
[in Yoruba] OK.
So, what you are saying to me is that you want me to compromise?
Is that not what every good relationship is about, huh?
Compromise.
It is. I'll see what I can do.
Thank you.
You see these people here...
this one is oil. Oil!
[chuckles] Mass market.
Do you like the food?
[Demidun] Babe, I'm sorry.
Honey, let's just go back to the way things used to be.
Please.
-No! I can't do this. -Please.
[Demidun] Please.
Please...
-[knock on door] -[Mopelola] Yes?
-Good morning, Ma. Mrs. Oge Briggs-- -Yes?
-[Oge] Mopelola, my darling. -[women laughing]
Oh, Kiki! [smacks lips]
Oge, what a pleasant surprise!
[Oge] We just came to commiserate with you, my darling.
-[Kiki] Yes! -Over?
Your family's financial woes, of course.
But we have no financial situation, Oge.
-Mope... -[Mopelola] Hm?
-You're a very strong woman. -[Oge] Hm-mm.
You're taking your financial situation to heart.
Look at you, you've become prudent.
Yes. You're wearing Ituen Basi of three seasons ago.
Well, I enjoy retro as much as I do the current fashion trends.
Well, for something to be considered retro,
-ten years should have passed. -[Oge] At least.
Yes, anything less and you're just plain broke.
I beg your pardon!
[Kiki] I'm not saying that you're broke. I'm not saying you're broke.
I'm simply saying that Proverbs 22 verse 3 suits you.
Yes, yes, the one about the prudent...
-[Kiki] Yes. -Yeah.
The prudent see danger, and they take cover.
-Oh, really? -[Kiki] Yes.
Well, [clears throat] let me see.
Proverbs 26 verses 23 to 25 suits you perfectly, darling Kiki.
-[Kiki] Hey? What does that say? -[Mopelola] Yes...
A smooth tongue may hide a wicked heart
[chuckles] as the glaze covers a clay pot.
Hm... But anyway, what brings you here?
In fact, Kiki, I called you a few weeks ago.
You never picked up my calls.
Yes, we were on a trip. We were on a trip. You know, this Lagos weather,
the heat, everything was just getting... was getting to me,
so we took a ski vacation in Aspen.
[Mopelola] Oh, how lovely. -We traveled as well. -[Mopelola] Oh, really?
Yes, we did New York, and then we did California.
Sorry we didn't tell you, but we completely avoided you know where?
-Atlanta. -[Mopelola] Oh?
All the Nigerians... -[Mopelola] Oh! -...teeming, coming out like...
Yes, like roaches everywhere.
-[Kiki laughs] -Yes, they're everywhere, aren't they?
But, uhm, Mopelola, you weren't able to travel, were you?
Oh, well. [clears throat] Uh, the family...
are currently going through a rediscovering Nigeria phase.
-[Oge] Tell us. -[Mopelola stutters]
Our country is so big and beautiful.
It is. That is a fact.
And it's amazing how much we don't know about it.
-True, true. -Besides,
"Buy Nigeria and grow the naira," -is what we say. -[Kiki laughs] Oh, yes!
-[Mopelola] Yes, yes. -So it had absolutely nothing to do
with the fact that the travel agent has just blacklisted you
-for unpaid bills? -[clears throat]
[Kiki] Are you ok?
Well, I'm sure you ladies must have
-something you need to attend to... -Mm...
-[speaking together] -So let me see you out.
-[indistinct muttering] -Thank you so much for stopping by.
Don't forget. Don't be a stranger.
No, of course. But I will... Yes...
-Do keep in... Keep in touch. -[women laugh]
-[Mopelola] Kiss the babies for me. -[Kiki] Yes, we will.
[Mopelola] The drivers are in the.. -[Kiki] That they are. -[Mopelola] OK...
[Mopelola] So you take care now.
[together] We will. Bye.
-Bye-bye. Bye! -[women laugh]
[scoffs] Fluttering witches.
[Oge] Biko, what is happening to your people?
There was a time when the title,
-we waited to hear who got it. -Hm-mm.
And it always went to, you know, women with sophistication and panache.
If your husband is a man
that controls the grassroots votes of the entire South-West, [chuckles]
and you have crooked teeth, one leg,
you're considered a woman of panache and sophistication [chuckles].
Is she having a party, or isn't she?
I heard she's doing it low-key. Hm-mm.
Low-key? She doesn't do anything low-key.
-Its either loud or nothing at all. -[Kiki] Exactly.
Maybe they're being careful because me, I'm yet to receive my own invitation.
Then, I don't think she's doing it.
-[groans] Or maybe she's not inviting us. -No!
That's not possible. Excuse you. Who will throw a party in Lagos and not invite Ngozi Gomez?
Excuse you. Who will throw a party in Lagos and not invite Ngozi Gomez?
-[woman scoffs] -Have you thought about it?
[scoffs] Well, I heard, from Mope,
that, uh, your husband's extended trip
that, uh, your husband's extended trip in the US is not a business one.
in the US is not a business one.
And that's what I heard.
She said that she heard
that he's in prison... for drug trafficking.
So maybe she is socially blacklisting you.
But I did not believe. I did not believe. When I-- Huh-uh.
What nonsense is that?
[chuckles] See wickedness.
Hey! Tunde, that is on contract with HSBC?
Exactly.
In fact, why am I having this conversation with the two of you people?
This is nonsense.
-I said it. -Exactly. Yes, we said it.
I said it. I said it. I said it.
-So it's true. -[laughs]
But you know what? She's not the one I'm concerned about at all.
It's Mope.
-And I know just how to find out. -Hm?
You are at it again!
So all this "gra-gra" and everything. It's true. He's in prison.
I'm at a party with my wife. I'll call you back.
All right.
-Huh-uh! -Akin!
[in Yoruba] Grey, Grey. How are you? You have gotten here too?
We are birds of the same feather.
[Akin] Ah! Your beautiful wife.
-[Akin] How are you? -[sighs] Good evening, Uncle Akin. [Akin] How are you?
[in Yoruba] I hope you haven't forgotten us.
Ah! Why would you say that? Look, I tell you what:
choose a date and a place,
OK?
I will be there. As long as that your dangerous Banga soup is there,
I will be there too.
Not a problem.
But for now, let me go and join my seniors on the dance floor. [Akin] All right now. All right.
You're a very lucky man. -Whoo-hoo! -Very, very. [chuckles] Very.
-Whoo-hoo! -Very, very. [chuckles] Very.
Chief Olisa, he wants to see us. He's waiting for us in the office.
-Really? -Yes.
There is something he has to discuss with us.
[Akin] Where is my wife? Let's go. I will call her.
Hope all is well?
[male member] There is no easy way to say this.
The bank has finally transferred your debts
to Asset Management.
What?
-[gloomy music playing] -We'll have to foreclose on St. Ives.
[female member] Surely there's something that we can do?
The governor intervened. I have two years lifeline.
We got an email, tracking your expenses for the past six years
on company funds.
Digital receipts of trips to... to Dubai, to Milan, Fiji Island, Mauritius.
All on chartered flights, multiple times in a year.
Homes in Asokoro, in Spain, in London.
[softly] Did you know about this?
[male member] Fleets of Maybachs, Rolls Royce, Bentleys.
I don't need to continue.
You know what you've been up to with money.
And so does the governor... because he was copied in the mail.
And he's not going to protect you to the detriment of his political career.
Who sent that mail? Who did this?
[chief] Does that matter? Look, we don't know.
So you're selling St. Ives?
We inherited your debt, -and we have to pay. -No!
So we'll be breaking down the company and selling its parts.
You know I've always been a loyal insider,
and I did all I could to stave this off.
But if that mail leaks,
everyone that protects you will be tarnished.
I'm sorry.
-[door slams shut] -Uh, thank you.
[Grey] I'll get you something strong, sorry.
Dunni Fernandez, Iya Oge, of Oniru.
-Thank you! -[crowd clapping]
Royalty has never looked so exquisite on the female species.
[in Yoruba] Of course, thank you.
[Oge] But while we celebrate,
we must remember those in our midst who have little or nothing to celebrate.
-[dramatic music playing] -Mopelola... Holloway,
my dearest, dearest friend.
This time last year,
you know, you, you gave us a 50th birthday to remember,
and now, you can't even produce your promised 51st.
You know, whether it's this AMCON takeover,
or the rumors about the dire financial straits
your husband's company is in, St. Ives,
whatever it is, my sister,
whatever it is, I stand with you all the way.
[inhales] But this is not the place for us to discuss that.
-Please, let us encourage her. -[applause]
-It's a prayer point, cheers. -[women] Cheers.
[woman] Cheers, everybody. It's a prayer point, cheers.
I've lost everything. The Holloway name is finally done for.
Not if you buy back the firm.
St. Ives is for sale. We can buy back our company.
That will be insider trading.
Only if we're caught.
We set up firms to buy each of these, and we bid for them independently.
Call in favors. Milk your network, Akin.
Still won't be enough.
Oh! Then you may need to dip into your coffers.
Treasury bills, jewelry, fixed deposits,
even the children's trust funds.
Oh no, I can't do that.
[sarcastic laugh] Can you lose St. Ives?
[Akin] Now, not only was there the risk of acting illegally,
I was gambling my whole fortune... on winning back my company.
Failure would mean I would lose everything.
And when you really need help,
this is when you find out who your real friends are.
My family had no idea what I was doing.
[Oge] Angela, I think the larger orchid would be nicer here. Yes, that one.
That's much better. Thank you.
[Mopelola] Oge Briggs!
-I'm going to deal with you with you-- -[Oge] Hello, my darling.
No, no, no! Don't patronize me, you over bleached heifer.
-Bleached? -Do you really think you can embarrass me in public and get away with it?
-What are you talking about? -You really think so?
What exactly were you trying to do at Dunni's party?
-Dunni's party? -Your ridiculous attempt to embarrass me?
-You cannot be me, Oge. Give it up. -Who is trying to be you, you...
You can't get the kind of attention I have.
...you tattooed bitch?
-Tattooed bitch? -Yes.
Better to be a tattooed bitch than a glorified prostitute, Oge.
Who are you calling a prostitute?
Oh! Have you forgotten your glory days of Asaba?
-Asaba? -Oh, I have evidence.
Chief Agbaje, video tape, Italy.
Two can play the game, Oge.
Let me remind you:
my name is Mopelola Holloway, and I play to win.
You started it. I am going to finish it. Now shift.
Gutter snipe. You come in from your little swamp,
and you think you can come to my Eko and take over.
I will deal with you in Eko. Bitch. Heifer. Runt.
Bitch. Heifer. Runt.
[Tokunboh] Ada stood over his dead body, her knife still in his chest.
She had finally avenged King Agwu, her murdered father.
But she began to feel woozy.
The poison from her knife wound was taking its course.
She stumbled through the forest, losing strength, almost falling.
Did she die?
[in Yoruba] Can you be quiet? Let her finish.
You remember the herbalist's kola nuts?
The cure to every poison that she told Ike to throw in the stream.
[Tokunboh] That was the stream he threw it in.
-Now you are talking. Beautiful story! -[man makes silly noises]
-[man makes silly sounds] -My brothers...
I can see the way you are smiling from ear to ear.
That you thoroughly loved what the young lady has said.
[man] Beautiful story.
[in Igbo] As the people overseas say, [in English] "This is just the tip of the iceberg."
[Nnamdi] What we want to do is to shock people.
This is going to be a cinema blockbuster.
[stutters] All we just need is just a token.
‎[in Igbo] A little amount.
Uh, 50 million naira, only.
-[man giggles] -Fifty what?
[in Yoruba] Did you hear what I just heard?
-[man make silly noise] -[man, language] What you are saying...
is that shooting a good film costs 50 million?
It's cinema. Big picture.
But this is not a glamour film.
It's not a film where you will see somebody taking their girlfriend to London and Paris
taking their girlfriend to London and Paris in a private jet to go, go and enjoy. Like a man living large.
[in English] If I call Anayo Phillip,
[in Yoruba] he will do it for five million.
-2.5. -1.5.
[man, in Igbo] You see, when he finishes with this film,
even Hollywood would call us and say, "Please, how did you do it?"
Don't misunderstand us.
-This is a good Asaba thriller... -[man] Hm-mm!
that we can have season 1, season 2, season 3, season 4 and 5.
I cannot drop my one kobo of my hard-earned money
because you want to do cinema.
[man] Fifty? Nah!
At what point do you get really mad at me and call me names?
Nnamdi, no. Don't even spare me. Say how you feel.
My mother, she's giving me grief over my dress sense.
Then my dress for the party is horrible.
And to make matters worse, I am bringing my bad luck your way.
Huh-uh. No, no, no, no, no. Toku,
Huh-uh. No, no, no, no, no. Toku, in business, there is no luck.
Sometimes you gain; sometimes you lose. That is business.
And tell your mother to leave my Toku for me the way I love her.
[exclaims] I remember the first day you walked into my office.
I said, "My God! Who is this lady glowing like the sun?"
Whatever that means, thank you.
And I love you.
No, look...
[stutters] I only said it because you said it twice.
When we were going to see your investors, and then a few minutes ago.
Why are you afraid?
If I say I love you...
then I love you.
[Venya] OK, you know what to do.
I told you, move that already. What are you doing? Chair!
[clapping] Come on, guys. I don't have all day.
[Mopelola] Be careful with that vase, young man.
[Venya] Don't waste my time. Do not waste my time.
Come on. Right there, move, move, move.
Beautiful day, isn't it, darling?
Uh, yes, Mom.
[in Yoruba] Uhm... What about George?
It's a busy season, so you know, he's always in the skies.
So he might not be able to make it to the party?
Demidun, when I first met your father,
he was a man of the world.
There was money to blow; women loved him.
The Holloway name stood strong behind him,
but he would have had no future if I hadn't intervened.
The devil with all his vials did not go to Adam.
He would have failed.
He went to the one thing that he knows a man cannot resist...
his wife.
Take control of your husband, Demidun.
Set him straight. Hm?
And stop crying. No man is worth it.
Now chin up.
That's my girl. Hm?
Oh, and talk to you little sister.
Convince her not to wear that... thing -that she wants to wear for my party. -[phone rings]
Uh, I'll talk to her, Mom, but I think she-- Hm-mm. Hm-mm.
Hello, Bunmi, I was just about to--
What? You mean, right now?
Demidun! Demidun, oh, Demidun!
[TV reporter] This is ABC news.
Mr. Akin, what happened to your company?
Why is the company being taken away from you?
[Akin] Excuse me!
-[reporter] What happened? -[indistinct talking]
-[Akin] Grey, what's all this? -[Grey] Akin, calm down, calm down.
The director is in the office.
[reporter] Mr. Holloway, why is the company being taken away from you?
This is my stuff. Mr. Director...
Did you attempt to purchase shares from your company using bogus fronts?
No!
We're no longer selling St. Ives.
She will be absorbed in an initial public offer.
[Akin] What? Mr. Director...
-From Holloway to No Way! -[women giggling]
I told you: pride, ladies, comes before a fall.
-[gasps] I'm not laughing. -Don't laugh.
Me, I'm not laughing. I'm crying.
Give me my laptop. You see? You see what I'm talking about.
[in Yoruba] Has it not happened?
The internet is going to catch fire.
[in Yoruba] Uh-huh. Ngozi, you send a gossip on an errand,
and she won't deliver? I have heard. The whole world will hear!
I have heard. The whole world will hear!
Come and give me a massage... and punch my body.
-Oh my God! -[tense music playing]
Hold on, babe.
[in English] Oh my God!
[in Yoruba] This guy will kill me today!
Who did this?
Who did this to me?
Who could have done this?
-[tense music playing] -Who did this?
[Grey chuckles] Almighty Akin Holloway, I was behind it all.
Everything, Akin.
I orchestrated everything. Everything.
From the insider trading,
the AMCON takeover, to all the deals.
I was behind it all. I set it all up.
[Grey] You fool!
What is the 10th commandment, Akin?
[Akin] Seriously?
The 10th commandment, Akin, what is it? Something about, uh...
[Grey] "Thou shalt not covet your neighbor's wife."
Did you honestly think that I was so dumb
that I didn't notice the damn of you? The smell of your cigar on her clothes?
Akin, I've been with you! I've stood with you! I stuck with you!
I walked with you!
Akin, you had everything! Everything, Akin!
That one thing that was mine, you had to have it!
My wife! In your bed!
Get up!
Now you stand... before your new chairman.
Get out. Get out! Filth!
Akin! [shouts] We're finished!
Oge Briggs!
Hi. [stutters] I don't know what to say.
Well, I, I heard the news, and I felt it wouldn't be right if I didn't show up.
Uhm, so here.
Thank you.
I'm still not coming home to you.
I'm just showing support... for today.
[stutters] It's fine. Uhm... Thank you.
Hi, George.
[George] Hey, Tokunboh, how are you?
Fine.
-[laughs] How are you? -I'm fine.
[stutters] I'm so sorry about your father matter.
I said, let me still come.
It's fine. I'm just super happy that you're here.
This, your house, is a serious location. [chuckles]
-I must shoot film here. -Stop!
-Come meet my sister. -Look at this!
Demidun, meet Nnamdi, and this is George, her husband.
-Hello. -Hello, hi.
-How are you? -Good.
This, your people's house is fine.
[Mopelola] Get that thing out of here.
Are you rusty in the brain? I said, get it out, now!
-Mommy, please, relax. -I want everything out of here. -Mommy, calm down. -Everything.
The flowers, the food, everything, everything gone, now.
George, bring down this damn thing. It looks like a bloody wreath anyway.
-Mom, can you please relax? -Calm down! Mommy!
Relax. We'll rise from this. Mom!
Rise! Rise from what, Demidun?
[Tokunboh] Mommy, please calm down Wake up and smell the coffee. This is a burial not a birthday.
Wake up and smell the coffee. This is a burial not a birthday.
The Holloway dynasty is dead, and you're still in Lalaland.
You better rise from your stupor and realize that we're finished.
Finished, like your bloody marriage.
Oh, and Oga, by the way, pray tell,
this other woman, is she as beautiful as my daughter?
-[Mopelola] Is she? -[Demidun] Mommy, please.
[stutters] There is no other woman.
Oh please, she might be stupid, but I'm not.
I have never ch--
I have never... I have never cheated on Demidun.
He... hasn't.
-I have. -[Mopelola] What?
-At Sharon's wedding, in Morocco. -[Mopelola] Why?
It was just a fling. It didn't mean anything.
George...
Please, I'm sorry.
Please, I need you to forgive me, please.
Please, I can't do this by myself.
I thought that this party will bring us back together the way that we used to be. Please, please, please forgive me.
Please, please, please forgive me.
Please, George, please.
I'm sorry.
Mommy, please. It's because you're upset that's why you're talking--
I know! Just...
What is wrong with this family?
What's wrong with us?
Just calm down. It's because you're upset.
Mopelola.
Don't speak.
Hello? Akin.
Mama, you weren't wrong.
I ruined everything.
I destroyed the family legacy.
All the terrible things to catch up with me.
Ma, I don't deserve to live.
You probably don't.
[in Yoruba] Yeah. Since you are crying like a child,
[in English] if that is your reaction to the issue.
But Mama, destroy the family name, I have brought it to the ground.
Yeah? And if we crash to the ground, do we sink into the earth like water?
No Mama. We rise.
We rise, Mama.
[in Yoruba] Hm-mm. I will find something for you.
[in English] Just good enough to start all over.
No, no, no, no, no, Mama. You were right in the first place.
I didn't take these things seriously because they dropped in my lap.
Now, I'm going to go for mine.
Hm? Comforting to hear you sound just like your father.
But... Mama, I need you to do something for me.
For Mope, actually.
[scoffs, in Yoruba] I am listening.
Demidun, Tokunboh, for everything, I'm truly sorry.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please stay. Please stay. Please.
I've brought this upon this family.
But it's my wife's birthday. She wanted to have a good birthday party.
And I intend to give her one, with your help, of course.
With our help? But will people still come with what's on ground?
People, we're the Holloways. That's all that matters.
Dad, you know what? Me and Demidun have the best idea ever.
We do?
-Uh... Daddy, just leave it to us. -Yup.
[Akin] Thank you. Thank you, all. Thank you.
[Tokunboh] No, no. Mommy!
Are you all right, Mommy?
Your father has finished us.
Mom, to answer your question:
you asked what was wrong with us.
I know that Dad may have done bad by us,
and I'm not exactly what you want me to be,
and you find a way to always remind us of how imperfect we are.
-That's only because I-- -Mom...
-Mom, we know. -We do.
We know that you love us. We do.
Yes, we may have lost St. Ives... but we didn't lose us.
And, Mom, it's only us -that'll get us out of this. -Exactly.
-Oh, my darlings, I'm so sorry. -[indistinct talking]
I'm so sorry. I love you both so, so very much, my darlings.
Don't cry again, Mama.
-You're amazing and strong. -Beautiful and strong!
Thank you.
So, uhm... -Mom, a few people are here. -People...
-Mom, a few people are here. -People...
[stutters] Oh no, I couldn't.
-No, I just couldn't. -OK.
I couldn't possibly face anyone now.
OK, maybe, Mom, I'll just tell Iya Oloja that...
...you don't want to...
-Iya Oloja? -Yes.
-She's here? -[both] Yes.
-Well, why didn't you say so? -OK!
[stutters] Look at me. Get the stylist.
Get the make-up artist, Bernard, or whatever his name is.
Where's my hair?
♪ There's a place that you know That you really, really wanna come to ♪
[Mopelola] My friends, loved ones, my beautiful children,
Akin, my loving husband,
for once, Mopelola Holloway is speechless.
All I can say is, thank you,
thank you for coming to honor me,

[Ngozi] Everybody that matters.
But the point is, how did they do it? How? How?
If you ask me, we can still attend.
Huh? Yes, now, we can attend. Uh-huh.
[in Yoruba] Will Mopelola say that me, Dunni Fernandez, Iya Oga one,
it is not possible. It doesn't look like it. She can't try it.
Dunni, if we don't attend this party, then there's a problem.
There's a problem...
Chief, look at your people. [laughs]
-Disgraced in the morning... -Yes.

[man] Ah. Horatio P. Huntington!
One half of the world-famous Huntington Brothers Circus!
Which half, I'll let you decide.
-And that's me! -Delish.
Uh, the good lookin' one.
Whoa. Slow down there, Chesterfield.
Why?
It's free, ain't it?
-[cheering] -You hear that crowd, little brother?
I'm going to be rich as Rockefeller, -but twice as pretty. -[woman groans]
Oh, you'll partake in the riches, too.
At a slightly smaller share, of course.
Oh, you know I don't care about money, Horatio. I just--
Want to entertain people. Yes.
Love that about you.
[Chesterfield] And everyone's favorite brother, Buffalo Bob Huntington.
The heart and soul of the circus.
Excuse me, Mister Huntington, sirs.
Oh, hey, Esmerelda. Everything all right?
Is better than all right.
I am slippings away from the fortune tellings booth
-to introduce you to... -[groans] ...beautiful niece visiting from old country.
Hopes you will give her job.
-What? No! -We would if we could.
[Horatio] We don't need more mouths to feed!
[Bob] Which is to say...
[both] She's hired!
I promise I will not be any trouble.
A real beauty, yes?
Oof. Family resemblance, huh? [laughs]
Oh, the apple does not fall far from the tree.
Fall far from the tree?
This apple looks like it was shot from the tree with a rocket.
Oh! You flirt.
Come here.
[Chesterfield] Up until that point, Bob and Horatio had a good thing going.
But you know what they say about good things...
they never last.
Thank you.
-[knock on door] -Horatio, hold on to your hat
'cause Talia and I have something exciting to tell ya!
-We are-- -Breaking up!
Getting married!
[blubbering] What?
[laughing] Is a blessing!
-I love love! -[grunts]
So romantic, no?
-No! Yuck! -[Esmerelda grunts]
Now then, I've allowed this to go on for far too long, little brother.
She's poison, this one.
Okay. I can see you're obviously not thinking straight.
No! I see everything quite clearly, Robert, and I am putting my foot down.
-Horatio! -You can't be serious.
-Oh, I'm dead serious. -I love Talia.
-And-- -Either she goes, or I go!
Choose now, brother.
[Chesterfield] Gee, I wonder what he should do.
What to do, what to do?
Ooh, this is a nail biter.
Bulletman!
Lick.
You want some?
Maybe you should cut down on the carbs there, Chesterfield.
That clown suit is looking mighty snug.
With this metabolism,
I could eat a chocolate elephant and never gain a pound.
-[button ricochets] -[Bulletman] Bulletman.
Man, sorry about that. [chuckles]
Esmerelda has giftie for newlyweds.
-A "giftie"? -From Himalayas.
I got it here somewhere. Ouch. Where did I put it?
Oh. No, you don't want that. [laughs]
Oh, uh... what is it?
Something special.
Something magic.
[Chesterfield] That old dame wasn't kidding.
-There was magic in that wooden box. -[kid] Come on!
For 30 years, Buffalo Bob's Rootin' Tootin' Animal Circus
-was the biggest show in the universe. -[tiger growls]
And no one was a bigger fan than this gooney kid.
Look at him. [laughing]
Bob's nephew, Owen.
[Chesterfield] He practically grew up right there in the front row.
-And he wasn't the only one. -Oh.
-Wow! Front row? -Mmm.
Thank you, Daddy.
[laughs] Nothing but the best for my little Zoe.
Well, it finally happened.
I can't see my feet!
Sorry, hot dog. I guess we won't be--
Wait a second.
Problem solved.
Say something to her, squirt.
Hi. I'm... I'm...
-[stammering] I'm... -[squeaks]
I'm Zoe. [laughs]
I'm Owen.
Don't encourage them.
-I'm clowning around. I'm just clowning. -[kids laughing]
[Chesterfield] And as time passed, it turns out
Bob and Talia weren't the only ones to fall in love at the circus.
What?
-[gasps] -Zoe...
I love you.
Will you marry me?
-[chuckles] -Honk once for yes.
Duh!
-[spitting] -Ooh. Sorry.
-[Bulletman] Bulletman! -[gasps]
Okay, Huntington,
I've been against this from the day you two met.
Zoe comes from a respectable family.
And you come from, well...
Hey, pull my finger.
...here.
Um...  in Chesterfield's defense, he's a clown.
Well, I won't have my daughter wasting her days
"clowning around" at a circus!
She's a bright, young girl
who's gonna be running the entire company one day.
Say, why don't you come to work for me?
[laughs] Yeah, at the dog biscuit factory.
Oh, no. You were serious.
Deadly.
Hey, good news.
I'm...
leaving the circus.
I'm gonna come work for your dad
at the dog biscuit factory.
What? Why?
Oh, don't listen to my dad.
You love the circus.
It'll be fine, you'll see.
It'll be the best decision I ever made.
[Chesterfield] It was the worst decision he ever made.
Hey, sweetie, I have a board meeting in a couple of minutes.
Can you just grab Mackenzie from daycare?
-Yeah, sure thing, honey. -Oh, you're the best. Mwah!
-Owen! Zoe! -Hey, Binkley.
-It's ready! -You mean it?
I think I finally got her calibrated correctly.
Are you serious?
I can... I can feel it!
Honey, if this thing actually works,
your dad's gonna stop loathing me and start liking me!
Stop it. You're his son-in-law. He loves you.
Your dad has me eating dog biscuits.
-You know, kind of... -Biscuits for dogs.
-He likes you. -He has me eating dog biscuits.
-Think about that. -[giggles] I'm eating dog biscuits for a job.
-But this, this could be my ticket-- -You mean our ticket?
Our ticket, yes.
What is it?
Only something amazing. [chuckles] Watch.
Your husband had a genius idea.
Dogs like people food, right?
-Pepperoni pizza! -Bacon burgers!
Pot roast!
So... we should make treats that taste like people food.
-Tater tots! -Mac and cheese!
-Chocolate chip cookies! -Sushi!
Anything you can dream of!
Gabagool!
Wait, you made this?
Yes! Well, no.
She did a lot of it, most of it. She's a genius.
I just created the machine.
Wow. Wow, wow, wow. This could work.
-It will work. -It will totally work!
Would you like the honor?
Yes.
Yes, I would.
-[inhales sharply] Well? -What's it taste like?
-Mmm. [shudders] -What? You like it?
Oh. Oh, no.
Well, it tastes a lot like vinegar. [hiccups]
Vin... vinegar? [chuckles nervously]
No. No, no, no.  That one should taste like cupcakes.
And sour milk! [groans]
-What? Impossible. Impossible! -[hiccuping]
-Owen! Your face. -Oh, wait.
-What's happening to your face? -I'm getting a real hint of old sneakers.
You shouldn't!
Ah! And this shouldn't be happening, either!
I'm a Heffalump!
Do something, Binkley!
[stammering] I don't know what's wrong!
That feels so much better.
-Does not smell better. -Yeah, it's... it's awful.
-Well, if it isn't Sir Burps-a-lot. -[Zoe] Agh.
Brock, what are you doing here?
Your dad sent me. You're late for the, uh, board meeting.
Okay, I know.
Just tell him that I need a few more minutes, okay?
What, do I look like, an errand boy?
Yeah.
Like some super handsome errand boy with shiny hair and big biceps,
perfect lips, and dreamy eyes.
Wait, wait, wait. This wasn't the way that I left these dials yesterday.
[Brock] Baby soft skin.
Okay. All fixed.
And check out these pecs.
Look at them go. Look at them go.
-How is it that he gets paid more than me? -I don't know, honey.
Zoe, we have a board meeting!
What are you doing in this--
Uh, in-- [stutters]
They've got a mind of their own, right?
What is this place?
Dad, Owen, and Binkley
have been working on something incredible for you.
It's a surprise!
[chuckles] You know the only surprise I like is to not be surprised!
Oh, it's true. He hates surprises.
Binkley is too shy to tell you,
but did you know that she is a certified genius?
-[gasps] -Yeah. How does that help me sell dog biscuits?
-Just give her a shot. -[sighs]
-Well? -[yelps]
Out with it!
Okay, well, you see,
Owen had this idea for new dog biscuit flavors,
and he asked me to build a machine to replicate people food
because, as we all know, dogs love eating people food.
-Which actually got me wondering... -Okay--
...do dogs eat the people food because we are or do they really like it?
Or is it because they're eating the food that we have on our plate...
-[harrumphs] -[laughs nervously]
...because we pat them on the head, and they go... [barks]
But then I was like, "No,
it has to be because the food tastes really good...
-Binkley! -A certified genius.
Can anyone understand what she's saying?
Not a word, sir.
All I have to do is flip the switch!
Wait. That's not the right sound. Something's wrong.
-Well, can you fix it? -[whistling]
[Binkley] I'm trying! I'm trying!
-Oh, shut it down! -Shut it down!
-I can't. It's going nuclear! -Please. Please.
[Owen] Mr. Woodley, I am so, so--
-[Mr. Woodley] Nincompoopy? -[Owen] Actually I--
[Mr. Woodley] Were you gonna say you're nincompoopy?
Because that's what you are, you nincompoop!
[Brock] You know, I lettered in sports back in college. Major star.
I know it's here, somewhere.
Whatever it is. I'll know it when I see it. [grunts]
I'll find it if I have to tear the place apart!
Where is it?
[grunting] What is it?
This should have been mine.
She should have been mine!
This all should be mine!
Hello.
Ugh. Useless.
-Ah. Nice doggy. Nice doggy. -[barking]
Who's a little sweetie-- Ah!
Bad doggy! Bad doggy!
Heel! Heel! Stop!
Oh, please, oh, please! Heel!
He's got my bottom! He's a bottom biter!
They were on sale. No judging.
Back! Back! Back, I say!
Run away!
-Bad dog! Help! Help! Ouch! -[sniffing]
Am I crazy, or do I smell smoke?
-Zucchini! Zucchini! -[barking]
Quickly, you lazy little Lilliputian!
[Mackenzie] Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey!
-Monkey! -Mackenzie, Mackenzie! Okay. Inside voice.
It's way past your bedtime. Let's get upstairs.
Gross. What were we thinking going to dinner?
Oh, really? You wanted to cook after a day like this?
-No. -No.
I could've.
Gross. It's in my ear, Zoe.
Go take a shower, you big baby.
Oh, yeah. It's in other places, too.
Why would you tell me that?
Got you, you little monkey!
Monkey! [laughing]
-[beeps] -Hello?
Yes?
What?
But... how?
Owen?
Well, I-- Yeah. Okay.
Thank you.
We'll be there.
[Zoe] What's wrong?
There was a fire at the circus.
My Uncle Bob and Aunt Talia, they're...
they're gone.
[Chesterfield] We are gathered here today to honor our dear friends Bob and Talia.
Buffalo Bob Huntington was a man among men,
an entertainer's entertainer,
-who loved making people smile. -[clown sobbing]
A man who could belch the entire alphabet on a single breath.
[burping] A-B-C.
Takes me like 24.
-He brought me in as a young clown -[cell phone ringing]
-and taught me everything I know. -Owen.
[whispers] Seriously. Turn it off.
Including this. [blows raspberry]
-This. -[nose honks]
And this.
-Ah! Come on, man! -[laughing] Again!
I call that one the "Walloping Wet Willy."
Not to be confused with the "Paralyzing Pee-Pee Pants."
Whoo-hoo! Predicament. -Hey! -...is for horses.
-Señor Pee-Pee Pants. -[laughs]
Oh, it's vintage, but it's good.
But all kidding aside, kidding aside,
your Uncle Bob and Aunt Talia
were people with the biggest hearts of anyone I know.
Always there for their family.
Gretchen, who paid for your electrolysis
when your days as "the Bearded Lady" were sadly over?
Bob and Talia.
That's right. And, Bulletman, there are 206 bones in the human body,
which means Bob and Talia took you to the hospital
at least 206 times.
What do you have to say about their love and generosity?
[whimpers] Bulletman!
You see?
We were all family to Bob and Talia.
And family was everything to them.
Oh, I simply must disagree with you on that, my corpulent clown.
-Horatio? -[thunder rumbles]
-Wait, you weren't-- -Invited to my own brother's funeral?
Yes, I seem to have unraveled that particular mystery.
Robert "Buffalo Bob" Huntington,
my blood, my brother, stole from me!
Robbed me of my legacy, my love,
and the last 50 years of my life!
Therefore, I have come to reclaim what was rightfully mine.
Endowed by the power vested in me
by these three and a half very dangerous men,
I now pronounce this circus mine!
-Hey! -What? How dare you?
And that includes the secret of the animals.
Where did he hide it?
Take it to the grave, dear brother, was that your plan?
-I think not. -What?
-[all gasp] -Tom!
Samson, Stabby, El Diablo, Zucchini...
...dispose of this riffraff.
The Zucchini scours the room
looking for an adversary worthy of his deadly skills. Huh?
When he suddenly realizes he's a lover,
not a fighter!
Tally...
Getting a bit hot in here, no?
-♪ Like a star ♪ -[Stabby] Juggling pins to a knife fight?
I really don't see the point.
Zucchini is now very afraid.
The Zucchini makes a note
to choose his adversaries more... [groans] ...carefully next time.
-Owen. -Yeah?
-I think maybe we should-- -Get out of here?
-Yeah. Let's go. -Good call!
Oh, no, you don't.
Bulletman!
Even memorials are more exciting with your family!
They certainly do know how to make an impression.
I'll give you that.
-[Owen] Hey! Whoa. -[giggles] Puppy! Kitty!
Hey, Old Blue, what do you have here?
What's he got?
Oh. Well, thanks, boy.
-[Bulletman] Bulletman! -[barks]
-[loud crashing] -See you later.
Hmm. A mysterious package. The Zucchini is intrigued.
Go after them, you fool!
The contents of that package may lead us
to my late brother's secret of the animals.
The Zucchini's henchman has a surprisingly good point.
Henchman? I'm not your henchman, you bumbling buffoon!
I hired you!
Says the henchman. Hey!
Oh, just go do your job, or you're fired, you diminutive dolt!
With his ever-faithful henchman's words of encouragement,
our fearless hero ventures alone, turning to his prey.
The hunt begins.
Oh, for science.
Lasagna!
It really tastes like lasagna!
No spots. No hiccups.
Whoo-hoo! It really works!
Oh, Mr. Woodley is--
Still trying to get that disgusting goopity-goop
out of his underwear.
Wasn't my fault, Brock.
Someone must have tampered with--
I just got an image of Mr. Woodley in his underwear.
Ah. You're welcome.
Just you wait, you lummox!
This is going to revolutionize the entire industry.
It's... it's  gonna be ground-breaking.
Why, I bet Mr. Woodley's profits will increase a thousand-fold!
Ha! A thousand-fold!
You can't even fold a dog biscuit once.
I've tried.
It's impossible.
I'm gonna change my destiny.
Yeah, I'm gonna make a new batch and show Mr. Woodley once and for all.
-If I could just build up the courage to-- -Ha! Never gonna happen!
You choke. You always do.
Hmph! Well, I guess we'll see about that.
Yes, I guess we'll see about that.
-That's what I just said. -That's what I just said!
Okay. I'll see you later, Brock.
"I'll see you later, Brock!"
Ooh. He makes me so mad!
-He's just a big, smelly... -[whistle blows]
Wait for it.
Wait.
[laughing] I love this job.
So, what's in the box?
Well, uh... that's kind of weird.
-What's that? -Old animal crackers?
[gasps] Cookies? Mmm!
Oh, no, no, no. These aren't the ones you like, baby girl.
These are really old.
So?
So, old gross cookies will turn you into a monster.
-That's a fact. Ask your mom. -It's a fact.
It's a fact. It'll turn you into...
[both] A cookie monster!
[laughing] No, they won't.
-Honey, look at this. -That is so adorable.
I drew this the summer we met as kids at the circus.
I remember you drawing that. I remember you showing me.
Yeah, I remember being a better artist, but...
Okay, look, that is you, I think.
-I have crazy hair. -I'm pretty sure that's me.
That's is a very complimentary version of Chesterfield.
-Looking lean. -[Owen] Here's Bulletman, as always.
And, uh... Uncle Bob and Aunt Talia.
-They were all there. -[Zoe] I know.
[Mackenzie] Monkey's hungry.
These aren't the cookies you like, angel.
These are, uh, very gross.
-They're probably gross, right? -They're gross.
But I'm hungry.
Well, she's hungry, so we should do something.
-I don't know if I have any snacks. -Look in the middle part.
-Anything? -I am pulling it.
-Look below the sunglasses. -I don't have snacks.
Oh, look! There! Fruit stand.
-Fruit stand. -Fruit stand!
Who loves...
[both] Bananas!
♪ I like to eat, eat, eat ♪
♪ Apples and bananas ♪
-♪ Boom, boom, boom, I love to eat... ♪ -♪ They're way better than cookies ♪
-♪ Boom, boom, boom, I love to eat... ♪ -♪ They're way better than cookies ♪ ♪ Apples and bananas ♪
Ooh, that's weird. I thought I turned that off.
No, you didn't. Owen, no.
-Ooh... that's Binkley. -It doesn't matter.
-Ooh... that's Binkley. -It doesn't matter. But it kind of could matter. It could matter.
But it kind of could matter. It could matter.
-Oh, take it. -Thank you so much.
Only because you said so, though.
-All right. Come on, my little monkey. -Binkley, how's it going?
[Binkley] I'm blue.
Oh, cheer up. It'll all work out.
No, my skin is the color blue!
-I look like Smurfette! -What?
It's gotta be Brock.
That bobble-headed booby is sabotaging us.
I think you're right, Owen, but Mr. Woodley loves him!
Oh. What am I gonna do?
You're the mechanical genius, Binkley.
-I don't know, set a trap or something. -[Zucchini grunts]
Yeah, catch him in the act.
But he keeps finding ways to get in here, no matter what I do!
He's like--
He's like a ninja.
He's like a ninja!
Like a big, smelly, muscle-bound, smelly ninja!
Are we talking about the same Brock? Come on. He's all muscle and no brain.
And he's a moron.
An imbecile.
He's a dodo, actually.
Well, he's more of a... a nincom--
-...poop? -[Binkley] What?
Owen? He's a what?
-[screams] -Owen? Are you--
-[phone beeps] -I'm a hamster!
Holy moly! Holy moly! Holy moly!
[man] Thank you kindly, ma'am!
[Owen] Holy moly! Holy moly! Holy moly! Holy moly! Holy moly! Hmm. Holy moly! Holy moly! Holy moly! Holy moly!
Mackenzie Marie, stop playing with the trunk. You're gonna break it.
Okay, here's your monkey food.
♪ She loves to eat, eat, eat ♪
Where's your father? We need to get going.
Holy moly! Holy moly! Holy...
moly.
-[Zoe] A mouse! -No, no, no! Zoe, hold on!
Don't worry, Mackenzie! Mommy's gonna kill the mouse!
-It's me! Zoe! And I'm not! A mouse! -[Zoe] Why won't you die?
Zoe!
For the love of Tom and Jerry, please stop pummeling me with your purse.
Did that mouse just--
-Aw. Daddy is cute. -Thank you, angel.
-Owen? -Yes.
Zoe, that's what I've been trying to tell you.
-But you just spoke. -Your finger is huge.
-What? What did you-- How did you-- -I don't know.
I was just eating one--
-The animal crackers your uncle left you? -Yes.
I was eating the one shaped like a...
[both] Hamster.
-Oh, wow! Oh, wow! -Oh, no! Oh, no! -Oh, wow! -Oh, no!
I don't even know what hamsters eat.
[Zoe] Wait.
Look at this.
"Owen, no matter what, do not eat these cookies."
Oh, thanks a lot, note! I could've used that 30 seconds ago!
Wait, wait, wait. "Until you see Chesterfield at the circus.
He'll explain everything."
-Wait. What? -"Love, Uncle Bob."
Hang on!
We're going to the circus!
The Zucchini has discovered the secret to the anima-- [grunts]
-[Mackenzie] Yay! Circus! -[Zucchini] Ah!
[Zoe] Gosh. They really need to fix these potholes.
Suffering severe internal injuries,
the Zucchini continues his pursuit!
Oh, come on!
Why is it when you're in a hurry, you get stuck behind a pizza truck?
-Yeah, totally. -What?
-Are you being serious? -Yeah, I'm being serious.
-Is that a thing? -It's a thing.
-I don't think-- -It's a thing!
-You've been stuck behind a pizza truck? -You need to go!
-Whoa. -It's 100 percent a thing.
-Well, if that's what you think. -Oh, that is what I think.
-Okay, we'll agree to disagree! -[tires squeal]
-[Owen yelling] Zoe! -Huh?
-[Horatio] Hello? -Cookies!
What? Who is this?
The secret to your brother Bob's animals is...
Is what, you nonsensical nitwit?
Animal crackers!
[Horatio] What? That makes no sense, you incompetent ignoramus!
How could animal crackers possibly--
Agh! Some kind of magic!
Magic? Magic?
What kind of a rubbish are you trying to...
Esmerelda.
Get me those animal crackers, Zucchini!
I must have them at any cost!
[Zucchini] I'm in a hurry!
Watch where you drive!
Hmm. Why is it whenever you're in a hurry, you get stuck behind a pizza truck?
It's go time.
Superman! Siesta!
The Thinker!
Cowabunga!
Defying gravity itself as he hurls over oncoming cars
and lands safely...
inside a house?
Why is the Zucchini in a house?
And why is he in a dress?
-[yells] -The Zucchini can't even explain that.
[gasps] Cactus!
Okay, who has a cactus room in their house?
Hey!
[muffled] Pull over! Pull over!
Oh, hi.
-Pull over! -What?
-What's he saying? -[Owen] Who?
Hey, wasn't that guy at the memorial?
Yeah, he came in with my Uncle Horatio.
[gasps] Wait, he's the guy who saw me turn into a hamster.
Well, he's freaking me out. What should we do, call the police?
Yes. No! Wait, I have a better idea.
-No. -It's a good one.
Please don't.
-Promise you'll love it. This is hilarious. -[Zoe] Please, can we discuss this?
-Your ideas end in tears. -[laughs] There it is!
No one can outrun the Zucchini!
Okay, now, speed up and open up the back gate trunk.
-Trunk gate. -The trunk or the gate?
The tailgate trunk.
-I don't know what that is! -The big door!
-The button to the left of the cup holder. -That's the emergency brake.
One, two, three, hit it!
Mamma mia!
Pappa pia!
Zucchini's gonna diarr--
-[cows mooing] -[flies buzzing]
Did you see that?
Did I see that?
Have you seen yourself?
-Yeah, it's pretty cool, right? -[Zoe] No, it's not! No.
Better than a hamster.
I'm enormous.
Teddy bear!
Blacking out.
-Oh, there's the circus! -She's so strong. [wheezing]
Baby, Daddy can't breathe.
Baby, daddy can't breathe.
Baby, I'm serious, daddy can't breathe!
Looks like someone started snacking early.
How would you like to be human again, Fozzie? [laughs]
Bulletman!
What are you looking for?
You'll see. It's gotta be in here somewhere.
Always hard to find. Like love, Waldo, a good Chinese restaurant.
Wait a minute. Is that me?
-That is you. -[Owen] In jeans.
[both] Tight jeans.
It is you. Yes, sir.
Every time you eat an animal cookie, a human cookie appears in the box.
To change back, you just eat it.
Pretty good, huh?
You want me to eat me?
[Chesterfield] Look at me. I'm Owen. My pants are high.
My IQ is low!
-Hey-- -Is for horses.
Which you could turn into if you eat this one!
Okay, so how do these things work?
Gypsy curse, stale flour, radioactive sugar mites.
Who knows? Who cares?
It's magic.
That's why the box always stays full.
Okay, so I just pick little cookie me up.
And, um...
[Chesterfield] Down the hatch.
I'm me!
For better or worse.
Mostly worse.
In your case...
definitely worse.
Okay, that's a little hurtful.
It's not that kind of moment?
Awkward!
You keep a close eye on these, Owen.
Your Uncle Horatio will stop at nothing to get his greedy hands on 'em.
Ladies and gentlemen,
gather around and be amazed at the fire-breathing feats of El Diablo.
Watch it!
Truly, we've reached a low point in our careers.
The Zucchini has returned!
Excellent. Step into my office.
Ugh! What's that horrible stench?
-Hmm! -So, where are they?
Did you get me those animal crackers or not?
-Yes! -Wonderful!
I did not!
I'm so close, Mario.
So close to what could have been mine.
What should have been mine.
A gift, an incredible gift, given to a simple-minded sap, my brother!
What a waste.
Think of the things I could've done with such a gift.
How my life would've been.
How very different things would've turned out.

Don't come back until you have those animal crackers. [sniffing]
[groans] And clothes that don't smell of manure.
The Zucchini agrees to accept his henchman's challenge.
Oh, for the last time, you pint-sized peon,
you are my henchman!
Said the henchman to the Zucchini!
Oh, just get me those cookies.
Samson, get us out of here posthaste.
And find me a place with actual paying customers.
[Horatio] Samson!
[Owen] Hey, buddy.
I wish Uncle Bob and Aunt Talia were here.
-I know. -[Chesterfield] They are.
In a sense, kids.
In a sense.
Oh, quick question.
You guys know how much clowns love surprising people?
-Uh, yeah. -Yeah.
-Wait, do clowns love surprising people? -[chuckles]
[laughs] All right. Well...
Surprise!
You are now the proud owners of one run-down, burnt up, worn-out circus!
-Wait. -Owen, this is amazing!
-Amazing? -Yeah.
Look at this place. What are you talking about?
-What are you talking about? -[scoffs]
You know what? You should do it. You run the circus.
Me? I should run a circus? [laughs]
I'm a clown!
I can shoot a mosquito off a camel's butt at 40 paces.
I've taught a whole generation of children... [imitates farting]
to "pull my finger." But I'm no good at running a circus.
And what makes you think I am?
Do you know what I do for a living?
-He eats dog biscuits. -I eat dog biscuits. Okay, I'll tell them.
-I eat dog biscuits. -And he hates it.
-They're dog biscuits. -Talks about it every day.
I have a right to talk about it every day.
Wait a minute. You're special, kid.
Your uncle saw that.
We all did.
What happened to that wide-eyed kid who used to love the circus?
I don't know. I--
He grew up.
Owen, this is what you've always wanted.
You're always trying to impress my father, and it's never gonna happen.
This... This is your heaven.
I mean, this is your future. This is our future.
Our future? Wait. Hold--
This isn't a future.
The circus was my Uncle Bob and Aunt Talia.
They're gone!
The magic is gone! I...
Wow.
I'm sorry, guys.
Everything that was special about this circus...
is gone.
-[nose squeaks] -[performers murmur]
You know what?
-I'm going to do it. -What?
I will quit my father's company
and rebuild the circus as Bob and Talia always wanted.
-Hold on. What are-- -No, I don't want to hear it.
-Zoe. -I'm doing it.
Doing it. Nope. Owen, I already got the nose on.
-No. You're not owing a circus. -Nope, I can't hear you. La, la, la.
You're about to inherit your dad's company.
-That's a big deal. -I don't care.
I've always loved this circus, and I know you do, too!
But, Zoe, you're--
Just need a little time to come around. I get it.
Besides, should be fun.
♪ And its working out super fine, yeah ♪
Still can't believe she would throw her life away
when she could be with--
Brock?
[screams] Mr. Woodley! I--
[chuckling] Why, I was just...
Seeing if the chair fit?
Fine Corinthian leather that cradles your butt.
So supple.
So...
What's the word?
Disturbing?
-Brock! -[yelps]
With Zoe gone to that circus,
I may as well consider having you take over the company.
[shudders] Oh, joy.
Okay, what if we try up-up-down-down- left-right-left-right-B-A-start?
I don't know, Binkley. I tried that earlier, and--
[Brock] Hey, pencil neck!
Woodley needs these accounting ledgers finished by noon.
Uh, what? [chuckles] What do I know about accounting?
Absolutely nothing! [chuckles]
Which is why it's funny that he asked you to do it, right?
-No. -Isn't that right?
It's not funny.
Does it bother you when I'm this close?
-Your breath is not great. -Yeah.
Um, this is too close.
Well, have fun screwing up the accounting and ruining the company.
'Cause you're totally gonna fail.
Here's your morning coffee, Mr. Woodley, just how you like it.
Why thank you, Brock!
By the dawn's early light, Huntington! Haven't you finished the accounting yet?
What? I... I just--
I'm still working on it, sir. It's very... very complicated.
Complicated?
It's just math!
All you need is a slide rule, some moon coordinates,
a ham sandwich, done!
Do you know how anything works? [chuckles]
I know Zoe could do this in her sleep, but she's at the circus,
and I'm stuck with you, you nincompoop!
I did it! I... I finally fixed it!
[groans] Again with this nonsense?
[stammering] Just try it, Mr. Woodley. Please?
Not even if I were poisoned and that was the antidote.
You try it, Huntington.
Uh, me? But you just told me to finish the paper--
Owen, please?
Okay.
Wow!
This is actually great.
This tastes like spaghetti and meatballs.
Really?
Yeah, it's amazing!
-I knew it! -No, like, I mean, amaz--
-[hiccups] -Oh, no!
-What's happening to his face? -[stammers] I thought I fixed it!
Oh! Nincompoops!
I'm surrounded by nincompoops!
[Zoe] Hey.
Why so late?
Mack's already asleep.
Yeah. Sorry. I, uh... I got "Brocked."
-Oof. -Don't ask.
-What is that? -What?
-The smell? -Is that...
-I don't know. -Is that cotton candy?
-Could be. I mean, I don't know. -Oh, no.
-I mean, I was at the circus all day. -No. No, no.
-You're trying to lure me back. -No, no. With smells?
-Why would you think that? -With cotton candy smells?
-Why would you be smelling cotton candy? -Because you're devious and evil.
[sighs] Honey, Mackenzie really misses you.
She wants you to come to the grand re-opening.
We worked so hard. It'd mean the world to her.
-You gotta come. -I know, I know, I just...
-Daddy? -Hey, angel.
What are you doing up?
-I'm scared. -Of what?
Monsters.
Let's go see about these monsters.
Okay, where are these monsters?
Well, don't worry.
-I'll protect you. -Uh-uh.
I don't want "Daddy" Daddy.
Owen?
[whispering] Owen?
-Good morning, Daddy Bear. -[yawns]
Good morning, Baby Bear.
Oh, do you know what today is?
Mm-hmm. Circus day. Are you coming?
Wouldn't miss it for the world.
[giggles] I love the circus. Circus, circus, circus circus!
-Owen? -Daddy, circus!
Whoa. Zoe.
-You did this? -Well, I... I had a little help.
From me!
Yes, from you, baby.
[kid] This is so terrible.
-When's this gonna end? -Can't be soon enough.
-I thought there were going to be animals. -[snoring]
Where are the animals, Mom?
-This is so totally boring. -[scoffs] I know, right?
-Agh, I mean, like, look at that. Dumb. -Ew. I know.
I hate this.
Perfect, they hate it.
I wouldn't say "hate."
They hate it!
This is bad. This is bad.
They didn't come here to see acrobats. They didn't come here to see clowns.
What they want is what they got before, Buffalo Bob's Amazing Animals!
-[fanfare playing] -Ooh.That's my cue.
Enjoy the show, folks.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen!
Behold the death-defying feats
of Bulletman and his Cannon of Doom!
Tough crowd.
Bulletman.
And his Cannon of Doom!
Doom!
Doom! Doom! Doom! Doom! Doom...
Bulletman!
-[audience laughing] -Oh, boy!
You stop that! Don't laugh at Bulletman!
Come on! We want some animals! Let's go here!
Where are Bob's Amazing Animals?
[all chanting] Animals! Animals! Animals!
This is a disaster! I have to do something.
Like what?
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy. Animals.
Oh, no, no, angel, I'm not a performer.
-So I can't just-- -Animals, Daddy. Animals!
[audience chanting] Animals! Animals! Animals!
Quickly! Quickly!
Next act. Where are my acrobats? Where are my acrobats?
[all] Terrified of failure.
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!
[Owen] Chesterfield.
-Owen. -Hey.
What are you doing backstage?
Well, I just thought I could lend a hand.
Or a hoof?
[Chesterfield] Come on. Come on, you big baby.
-Quick question. -Move it.
-[Owen] Are you sure this is safe? -Absolutely!
It looks a little--
-Your Uncle Bob did this ten times a week. -What is that?
Okay, I'm supposed to land in that?
[Chesterfield] Yeah.
That looks like a fishbowl!
Take it easy, horsey!
Excuse me. I'm not doing this. I'm gonna be killed.
-Says who? -Says physics!
A 1,000-pound horse landing in a very small bowl
at 150 miles per hour equals... splat!
Fine. Here, you big baby.
-What is that? -I don't know. A trout?
-No, a salmon. -[Owen] Great.
Or a goldfish.
Either way, something that's delicious broiled in butter.
What am I supposed to do--
Mommy? Is Horsey-Daddy gonna be okay?
Oh! I mean, yeah. He is gonna be, uh, fine.
I think it's just part of the act.
[Chesterfield] Ladies and gentlemen!
You asked for it, you got it.
I'm pleased to announce the return of Buffalo Bob's Amazing Animals!
-And now, Buttercup will leap-- -Buttercup?
That's the horse's name.
You couldn't come up with anything cooler?
-Like what? Majestic? -Um... No.
-Seabiscuit? Horse-nado? -Okay. Please stop.
-Darth Neigh-der? -Stop.
Buttercup, fine.
As I was saying,
Buttercup will leap 100 feet into a fishbowl.
You know what? I don't feel great about this--
Giddy-up!
Left, left, left! I mean, right. Sorry. Right. Right!
My right!
-[Horatio] Who is this? -The Zucchini has done it again!
-What? -Come at once!
-Bumbling buffoon! -Henchman.
I am not your hench--
[Chesterfield] All right, folks,
that brings us to the end of tonight's show.
Join us again next week.
-[crowd gasps] -Please, no one scream at all, or you'll die!
The mighty Bengal tiger is one of the most fearsome predators
to walk the face of the Earth.
His razor-sharp fangs will rip flesh and grind bone.
Be perfectly still, ladies and gentlemen.
I think this ferocious feline has found...
prey!
[whispering] Psst. Hey, angel.
Hi, Daddy.
-You ready to have some fun? -Mm-hmm.
[Chesterfield] What's this?
-The little girl's not afraid! -[all gasp]
[Chesterfield] She's... She's taming the savage beast!
Giddy-up, tiger! Giddy-up!
[Chesterfield] Ladies and gentlemen,
little Mackenzie Huntington is the queen of the circus.
Faster, Daddy! [laughs]
Faster! [giggling] Whee!
That was fun.
You were fantastic, kid.
And, Zoe, none of this could've happened without you.
Honey, you were right.
-Hmm? What's that? -I said you were right, and--
No, I'm just not sure if I heard you.
-I said you were right. -So let me just hear it one more time.
You were-- Oh, okay.
-[laughs] -Good one.
Can we do it again, Daddy?
Yes.
Yes, we can.
So what are we saying here?
I'm saying...
-[squeaks] -[giggles] I'm gonna quit my job at Woodley's first thing tomorrow
because this is my home.
This is my family.
The Huntingtons are back in the circus business!
Yes! Whoo-hoo!
You heard the man. We're back!
Acrobats, more sparkles on your leotards.
Clowns, I wanna see your size 42 shoes so shiny
-I could see my bulbous nose in it. -[squeaking]
-And Bulletman-- -Bulletman.
Stay away from sharp objects.
Bulletman.
Tomorrow, Zucchini, take the cookies from him after he quits his job.
All alone, unsuspecting,
vulnerable.
[Mr. Woodley] Quit? You can't quit!
Who'll taste the dog biscuits?
I recommend Brock.
You've destroyed everything.
You took my daughter away from me!
She's out there somewhere, dressed up as a clown or a horse
or whatever it is you circus people do!
We entertain, Mr. Woodley.
We make people happy.
Look, Zoe's just ten minutes away.
You can visit her any time.
Me? [scoffs]
Go to the circus?
Well, I know she and Mack would love to see you.
Think of your family!
I am, Mr. Woodley.
All of them.
Yes!
That was so scary.
But so good.
Oh, so good.
Running away to join the circus?
-Um... -I knew you'd quit.
-You've got quitter all over you. -All right.
Like some kind of quitter cooties or something.
That's me, Owen the quitter.
It's disgusting.
Excuse me. Have a nice life.
-Cookies! -Hey! Wait! No! Give those back!
-Don't mind if I do. -Wait! No! Wait, Brock. Hey, trust me.
-Hey, look, a monkey. -No!
Stop your whining, Huntington.
-Brock. -I'm just monkeying around.
You're gonna wanna listen. Wait, no, Brock!
Oh, boy.
I'm a monkey!
Technically, you have a blue butt, so you're a mandrill,
which is like a baboon, but not.
-I have a blue butt! -Wait, no! Brock!
I have a blue butt! [sobbing]
-A baboon. -Mr. Woodley!
A talking baboon!
A lion!
Give me back my cookies!
A talking lion!
There. [sighs]
No more excuses, Binkley.
This time, the dog biscuits are going to be perfect.
-A baboon! -What did you do to me, Huntington?
A talking baboon!
-A lion! -Nothing you didn't deserve, Brock.
A talking lion!
It's got me! It's got--
No, just--
Bad monkey.
-Get out of there. -You think I want-- Ah!
Get out of there, you coward.
Come on. I just calibrated it!
[Brock] Hot! Hot! Hot!
Very hot!
[Owen] Give me my cookies back!
Owen?
Yeah, sorry about the mess, Binkley.
-But-- -Brock stole one of my animal crackers
-and turned himself into a baboon. -But he'll... He...
-What? -I'll explain everything later.
Cookies that turn you into animals.
I don't wanna have a blue butt!
I can turn you back if you give me the box!
You'll get a big box of nothing!
Like a shadow in the night, the Zucchini approaches his prey
with all the predatory instincts and stealth of--
A baboon!
If you'll excuse me, it's sleepy time for Brocky-poo.
Well, that was surprisingly easy.
Another victory for the magnificent Zucchini!
So dashing, so daring, so mascu--
Lion!
Huh? Why, you--
The Zucchini has returned triumphant!
Is this my nephew?
Yes!
-Excellent. -He is not your nephew.
If he's not my nephew, why bring him here, you fumbling feather brain?
Voila!
But these are useless, you second-rate simpleton!
They're broken!
Wait.
What's in his other hand?
Interesting.
Ah! The nerve of him. After all I've done for that boy.
I should never have let my little Zoe marry that circus freak. -[glass shatters] -[cat shrieks]
Now someone like Brock...
Now that's a fine go-getter.
-Say, where is Brock? -[glass shatters]
-Brock! -[yelps]
Ah! Winkley! Brinikley? Barkley? Wrigley?
-Uh... you, what are you doing here? -I was--
-Have you seen Brock? -No, sir.
-He should be here somewhere. -But I was hoping that--
Brock! Where is that man? Brock!
-Mr. Woodley! -[gasps]
I have something important that I need to tell you,
and I... I... I demand that you listen to me!
Demand?
-[gasps] -Yes, demand!
Now sit your butt in that chair and listen up!
Sleep well, honey.
Shh! Sorry. Hi.
Oh, my goodness. What is wrong with you?
-You almost gave me a heart attack! -That had to be scary. Sorry.
Okay, but change back and tell me what happened with my father.
-Um... -You quit? Yeah. I totally did. It was great.
I'm so proud of you!
-Thank you. -We're going to be so happy.
-But... -Yeah?
I...
I lost the human cookie.
You-- You what?
It has to be in here somewhere!
I looked like 100 times. It's not--
-Trust me. What? No! They-- -Try this one.
Maybe there's just too many cookies to see it!
Maybe eat some more to clear up some space.
-Try this one. -The box always stays full.
Maybe not, if you eat faster. You've got to eat faster!
Please eat faster! Please eat faster!
Zoe! Zoe! Stop! It's not here!
Look, the box keeps adding new animals, but not new human cookies.
There's only one of those, and it's gone, Zoe.
-It's... -No!
No, I will not accept that.
There's got to be a way to get you human again.
-Zoe-- -In the meantime,
we're just gonna tough it out, gonna make it work.
I mean, how hard can it be?
[Bulletman] I... I hold it true.
I hold it to be true.
What's wrong, kid?
What's the matter?
What happened to you? You eat a bad banana? [chuckles]
No, I'm just...
Oh, look, kid, look.
I know it's been hard these last couple weeks.
Not being human and all,
spending your life without opposable thumbs.
You're shedding everywhere.
-Shunned by the entire-- -You're not helping.
You didn't let me finish.
You're shedding everywhere, shunned by the entire world.
-Okay. -But look at the bright side!
You and Zoe brought life back to this circus.
You've not only brought our circus family together,
but you've brought tons of other families together
to laugh and cheer and eat overpriced cotton candy.
-[laughs] -Come on. That's gotta count for something, right?
Chin up, kid.
You're making people happy.
That's no small thing.
Clowns are notoriously horrible liars.
Horatio.
-What are you-- -I've just come to talk, my boy.
-[Chesterfield] Ladies and... -Make it quick.
Just a moment of your time.
[Chesterfield] ...the return of Buffalo Bob's...
Oh, yes, the grand re-opening
of Buffalo Bob's Rootin' Tootin' Animal Circus.
Odd that you kept my brother's name.
Because it was his circus. What do you want, Horatio?
I have a proposal for you.
What could you have that I would possibly--
I'm offering you a chance to become human again.
Wait.
That's-- Is that--
Oh, yes.
My cookie! Give it--
Wouldn't want me to crush it to bits, would you?
No, no, no! Please!
Just tell me what you want for it?
Why, my boy, I simply want what was rightfully mine.
The fame, the fortune...
the circus.
-What? -Once I have those animal crackers--
You want the crackers, too?
The circus is no good without them, is it?
I... I can't!
I'll only make this offer once.
If you refuse...
Well, that's how the cookie crumbles.
-Human again. -Think of your family, Owen.
-My family? -Yes, your family.
What would they want you to do?
My family.
Do you think they want a filthy beast for a husband?
A father?
[Owen] My family.
Yes, yes, your family. Now, do we have a deal?
-No. -Excellent! Wait. What?
-No deal. -Are you mad?
Do you wish to remain a wretched animal for the rest of your life?
You know what?
If being a wretched animal lets me keep my family together,
-then, yeah, sign me up. -Oh!
Because I'll be a gorilla or a horse or a rhinoceros
or whatever filthy beast I have to be
to keep my family together.
I was afraid you would have too much of my brother in you.
Oh, well.
It seems we'll have to do this the hard way.
What?
What did you do?
Apparently, one does not need to eat the entire animal cracker
to assume the attributes of said animal.
-[roars] -No!
Hey, give me that!
-Now then... -[Owen] No!
...let's conclude our business, shall we?
-Get off me. -After all, a deal is a deal.
And I would rather not deal with an 800-pound gorilla.
Yes, I would rather deal with pathetic little you.
Hey, what's all the barking about?
Horatio?
[gasps] Owen!
You're you again!
Now, attention acrobats, jugglers, stage hands, clowns.
They make me sick.
I would like to announce the immediate takeover of this circus.
As of this moment, you are all fired.
-[cannon booms] -Bullet...
...man!
Nice work, Bulletman.
Everybody grab a cookie!
No! Stop them!
Is that the best you got? Hey, Stabby, my turn!
[Binkley] Excuse us. Sorry.
Why did you drag me here? You know how I feel about the--
Did you see that?
That bunny rabbit turtle thing
just got drop-kicked by a duck-billed platypus!
It's just a classic.
-Horatio, got the box! -Ya!
Got it.
Oh, poop.
Thank you very much, clown!
-[Owen] Got it! -[grunts]
And I've got you!
Sorry, Horatio, but I can't... [chomps]
stick around.
Fools!
Look at you!
A hippopotamus.
Giraffes.
Monkeys. [chuckles]
You lack the vision to truly create something
the world has never seen.
You use them to entertain,
but I... I will use them to rule the world!
Behold!
I am Horatio the Chimera.
I am a god!
[Bob] Horatio! Brother, stop this!
What did you say?
Please, Horatio.
Uncle Bob?
-Robert? -[Talia] You must stop this madness!
Talia?
But I thought you were both killed.
Not killed, but we can never be human again.
You see, that fire you started destroyed our human cookies.
I didn't mean to.
I know.
And...
what's in the past is in the past.
But look around you, brother.
Is this really how you want to be seen?
How you want to live your life? Like this?
A monster?
Better this than a broken-down old man, Robert.
Or a dog.
Don't you think?
What I think, Horatio, is...
...you're better than this.
Then you're a fool!
No!
Bulletman, get in your cannon!
[Bulletman] Bulletman.
Okay.
Don't eat this until after I fire you.
Bulletman!
Ready?
[muffled] Bulletman!
Bulletman! [laughs]
Bulletman, now!
Oh, poop.
Kitty!
-Mackenzie! No! -[Owen] No!
No!
Gotcha!
-Hi, Auntie Kitty. -[sighs]
Hello, my little monkey Mackenzie darling.
This ends now.
Do you not see the utter futility of your endeavors, boy?
Can you not smell the destruction of all you know and love?
You are lost.
There is no hope!
[gasps] Owen!
[Zoe] Mackenzie!
-[screeches] -Mackenzie!
[Zoe] No!
Mackenzie, jump!
Zoe, look.
Zoe?
It has to be somewhere. Come on.
Zoe?
I got it.
Zoe?
Don't mess with my family!
Chesterfield!
Now!
No. No!
Blast you all!
I'm Horatio P. Huntington!
I will not be silenced!
I will have my revenge!
Victory shall be mine!
What are you doing?
Unhand me this instant, you over-muscled oaf!
I hold it true, what e'er befall.
I feel it when I sorrow most.
'Tis better to have loved and lost
than never to have loved...
at all.
-Bulletman! -Bulletman! Bulletman!
Bulletman!
How will we ever top this performance?
[sighs] I have no idea.
[Zucchini] What about the Zucchini?
What about you?
Change me back!
Let me explain.
You ate the broken pieces, you doofuses!
That means you have broken pieces in the box.
Don't you get it?
It's gonna take time to figure out who's who.
You want his arm and his leg on your body?
[laughs] Tiny little body.
Point taken.
-It's cool. -We're good.
Take your time. The Zucchini can wait.
How dare you?
Do you not know what I am?
Who I am?
Let me out of here!
Please?
Oh, I've missed those lips.
-We did it, Zoe. -We did.
Aw. Just wish my dad could've--
Could've what, sweetie?
-Dad? -I saw what you two did out there.
The heroics!
The chemistry!
That whole changing into animals thing!
I mean, just fantastic!
Owen, I'm so sorry for the way I've treated you.
You're no nincompoop, quite the opposite.
And, Zoe, you are an amazing woman.
But, of course, I've always known that.
I love you, Dad.
-Grandpa! -Ha-ha! Hey, there, little monkey!
You were terrific!
Guess what, Grandpa. I'm in the circus!
In it? You're gonna be the star!
Let's go get you cleaned up.
So, it turns out Binkley is precisely the genius you said she was.
Oh, gee.
[Woodley] She's concocted something quite amazing.
[Chesterfield] Binkley really was a genius.
Wait till you see what she came up with.
So, how'd it go?
We're about to find out.
-They just went on sale minutes ago. -Uh, what went on sale?
Remember those dog biscuits that turned our skin crazy colors?
-Vividly. -How could I forget?
-I think I threw up on your shoes. -Oof.
Binkley found a way to turn those failed experiments
into a new business venture!
[Zoe] Oh, so what do they do?
See for yourself.
[Zoe] They just love it!
Look at them. They're having a blast!
But, I mean, how will they change back?
-There we go. Yup. -Wow.
We thought it best not to advertise that part. [laughs]
-That was a big one. -[laughs]
But that's fun.
Wow, you still find it funny, I see. Still like it.
Ha-ha! We're going to be rich, partner.
Partner? [giggles] I've never been one of those.
I mean, like in a game maybe, but not like in a business.
Bravo!
Wonderful, Mackenzie.
You are natural.
Daddy! Daddy! Did you see me ride the pony?
Did I? You're fantastic!
Auntie Talia taught me!
[laughs] She will be the star in no time.
Just like you, sweetie.
Look at you, my gypsy princess.
Queen.
-Queen? -[laughs]
Do you want me to tell you your fortune?
I think I already know it.
Oh, yeah? What is it?
I live happily ever after.
[clicks tongue] Owen.
It's showtime!
Places! Let's take our places!
Owen, sweetie, you're up next.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to Buffalo Bob's Rootin' Tootin' Animal Circus!
Prepare for...
Well, that's new.
And a little dangerous.
What's life without a little danger?
Ooh. Who is that guy?
I like that guy.
Prepare yourselves for something truly amazing!
All right.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
Prepare yourself for something truly incredible!
Hey, and, you know, don't burn the place down.
Prepare yourself
If she wasn't feeling well, she should have called us.
I bet she didn't say anything because she thought you were busy.
Grandma was always like that. You know that, right?
Daisy.
Are you blaming…
me for this?
Not really. I just think…
Grandma must have wanted to see you more.
She must have wanted to see you more.
Because…
Grandma…
she loved you so, Mom.
She…
lost her own mother when she was still young.
Letters?
Those are the letters Grandma received from Great-Grandma after she died.
Letters from someone who had died?
She asked a doll to be her scribe, so Grandma would receive a letter every year on her birthday,
so Grandma would receive a letter every year on her birthday, even after she was gone.
A doll? Are there dolls who can write letters?
A long time ago, there was a man who made a typewriter for his blind wife.
He called the machine an "auto memory doll."
Later, people began using the word "doll" to refer to women who worked as scribes.
Scribes? They wrote letters for other people?
Yes.
Back then, many people couldn't read and write.
Later, more people learned how to write and telephones became common.
Fewer people send letters now.
That job probably doesn't exist anymore.
Back then, when a person wanted to write something special or difficult,
they'd ask a doll to do it.
Grandma really treasured those letters very much.
I see.
We have to go back now. Our patients are waiting.
Yes.
You too, Daisy.
I'm going to stay here a while longer.
Grandma would be lonely without anyone here
after the funeral, right?
Daisy.
Why don't you leave, Mom?
You always put your job before family.
That's not true.
I care about Grandma.
I care about the both of you a lot!
Come, I'll take you to the station.
Daisy. We'll come back after work.
Grandma.
I said an awful thing to Mom again.
Though I know…
Mom has a really hard job.
"Ann, happy eighth birthday."
Many sad things may be happening.
And you might be feeling overwhelmed right now.
But don't lose hope.
Even if you're sad and feel like crying…
don't forget:
Your mother loves you very much.
Ann, happy tenth birthday.
You must have grown up quite a bit.
But I'm sure you still love reading and dancing.
Have you outgrown riddles and bugs?
Happy 18th birthday.
You're grown up now.
Are you in love?
I can't give you love advice.
But I'm sure whomever you choose is a wonderful person.
Happy birthday, Ann.
You've lived for 20 years now. That's amazing.
But remember, even adults are allowed to complain sometimes.
Whenever you're feeling down, remember that I am with you.
Ann.
I will always… always… be watching over you.
Ann.
She received a letter like this…
every year on her birthday?
Great-Grandma…
must have been really worried about Grandma.
A newspaper clipping?
Who is this person?
Those letters were written…
by a doll who was very famous back then.
She wrote a love letter for a princess once.
She also wrote the lyrics for an opera performed by a popular singer.
And she even wrote the script for a play of a famous playwright.
She worked for a postal company in Leiden.
But she quit when she turned 18.
Afterwards, there was no news about her.
The name of that doll was…
VIOLET EVERGARDEN
I picked her up on the northern front.
She doesn't have a name.
Hey! Say hello!
You can't treat a child like that!
Gil. She's no child.
She's a weapon.
Just a tool, a tool of war.
Would it be okay if I gave you a name?
Violet.
Violet.
I have a feeling you'll grow into the name when you're older.
Don't be a tool.
Be a person who embodies her name.
Violet Evergarden.
Come forward.
The writer of this year's hymn to the sea…
will now present the hymn to this year's goddess of the sea,
Ms. Ilma Felice.
The hymn to the sea was very good.
Violet.
You must have truly worked hard on it.
Violet.
Yes.
It was different from a normal letter.
The sea is boundless.
It is home to many organisms.
It is abundant and beautiful.
However, it doesn't have
achievements, status, or personality.
It was hard to write praises for it.
Well…
Okay! I'll write it next year!
You can't write the hymn to the sea unless you're selected to do it.
I'm gonna start writing lots of great letters
and make sure they choose me! Right, Violet?
Yes. I hope they choose you.
Leave it to me!
Yes.
Violet Evergarden.
Mr. Mayor… and the mayor's wife.
Violet, this is the Mayor of Leiden
and his wife.
I am pleased to make your acquaintance.
If it is your wish, I will travel anywhere to meet your request.
Auto memory doll…
Violet Evergarden, at your service.
You're so beautiful. You really do look just like a doll.
Yes.
I've heard so much about you.
It was I who recommended you to be the person to write the hymn for the sea
the person to write the hymn for the sea for the Festival of Thanksgiving.
The public oath you wrote for King Damian…
of the Kingdom of Flugel was a kind of public love letter.
It was quite beautiful,
as beautiful as you are.
When I wrote the oath for the coronation,
all I did was put the visions and aspirations of the king into words.
Although you describe me as beautiful,
there is no correlation between the words I write and myself.
I mean no offense.
Violet, in other words…
In other words, I am giving you a compliment.
Right now, you are a doll, but before that,
you were a brave soldier who saved Leidenschaftlich.
I didn't save Leidenschaftlich.
It was the countless soldiers who fought.
But… the war claimed so many other lives.
I too took many lives.
Therefore…
I am not a person who deserves praise.
Should we eat?
I want yakisoba.
Try something else for a change.
Okay.
Violet.
Erica.
It's been a while.
Hey, you look like you're doing well!
Yes. President, it's been a long time.
How's being the playwright's assistant?
The same playwright that Violet scribed for, right?
Yes.
I introduced Erica to him after we went to see his play.
I asked if I could be his apprentice.
He writes and rewrites things all day.
It's hard keeping up with the typing.
But I'm learning a lot.
Do you want some yakisoba?
Benedict, we're trying to have a conversation.
Don't talk to me like that. You're so mean.
Would you like to walk around the festival with us?
I'm sorry. Thank you for inviting me.
But we have a rehearsal for next month's play.
Did you write the script!
Yeah.
It's a small play we'll do at the community theater.
But please come see it.
I'll be going now.
See you later.
Okay.
It goes to show, anything's possible if you wish hard for it.
Not everything no matter how hard you wish.
What should you do then?
I'm going to excuse myself too.
I have a lot of work to do.
You can take the day off.
It's the festival!
No. It'll interfere with my planned work schedule.
I'll go back now.
Major.
Major?
Save yourself.
Leave me here. You have to run.
I won't let you! I won't let you die, Major!
Stop!
Just stop!
You have to live.
Violet.
You have to live.
Be free.
With all my heart.
I love you.
Dearest Major Gilbert,
I had a flashback about you today.
No matter what I see, and no matter what I do…
my memories are connected to you.
As time passes… and the past fades away…
my memories of the time we spent together still come back to life.
You kept me by your side.
When I was unable to do anything, you taught me how to live.
And you gave me… the words…
"I love you"…
for the first time.
That's why I can't help writing to you again like this.
I hope… this letter will reach you someday.
And I pray that my wishes will come true.
That comes out to three Corse in change.
Thank you very much.
It weighs 1.2 Leib. That will be 11 Corse, please.
Hello. This is the CH Postal Company.
If it is your wish, I will travel anywhere to meet your request.
Auto memory doll, Iris Cannary, at your service.
Yes. She's here.
Thank you for waiting. The schedule of the doll you requested is booked for the next three months.
The schedule of the doll you requested is booked for the next three months.
Could I help you instead?
Oh… I see.
I understand.
I'll make your reservation for three months from today.
Yes… that's right.
Goodbye.
Iris.
Don't give the customers that attitude.
They can't see my attitude over the telephone.
Your emotions show in your voice.
All right.
You have lots of reservations too, right?
Not as many as you, Cattleya.
At this rate, I'll never move up from third place around here.
Thanks for your hard work.
Oh, president, good evening.
This week has been busy, right? I hope you get some rest over the weekend.
I'm going on a business trip this weekend.
I've been asked to be the secretary for the commerce treaty with Gardarik.
Oh, that's right.
I'm planning to attend the mayor's wife's party.
I'm going to look for new customers.
You all work too hard.
I recently took up tennis.
I was looking for someone to play with me.
Don't you have any sense of crisis?
We must work hard while we still can.
People will stop sending letters someday all because of that horrible machine.
They'll finish building that radio tower soon.
When that happens, everyone is going to get a telephone.
You're right.
A lot of things are going to change.
Our postal company will gradually change as well.
Someday, a doll's job will be considered…
old-fashioned.
It will become obsolete and disappear.
That's exactly why we must work while we still can!
Violet, are you going to the party too?
No… I…
Don't make me bring my rival to the party!
Yes. Don't make her do that.
I have my own plans for the weekend.
All right!
Come on! Why can't you hit less hard!
I would if I were playing with a girl,
but it's just you today.
Everyone's so busy.
Even Violet turned me down.
I think it's nice she's going out for a change.
But it's nice having her around.
It helps me get attention from girls.
When I'm out delivering, people ask me,
"Are you from the CH Postal Company?
Where the doll named Violet works? Introduce me to her."
Don't use Violet for your own dirty motives!
But…
I wonder where she went today.
You're so overprotective.
Captain.
So it was you…
who's been leaving flowers for my mother every month.
I should've come tomorrow, on the anniversary of her death,
but your other relatives might come.
Did I trouble you?
No.
But you didn't need to come all this way.
It's your day off today.
I was able to come because it's my day off.
Are you here on his behalf?
I'm not doing this on behalf of the major.
I came of my own free will.
How many years have gone by since the end of the war?
You understand, right? He's not…
Forget Gilbert. Forget him.
It is… too difficult to forget.
As long as I'm alive…
I can't forget him.
Hey!
Violet.
No. That flower is not a violet.
It's called a pansy.
I see. You know a lot.
Even if I never see him again.
"I can't… forget him."
My ribbon.
Hello. CH Postal Company.
Um… Can I speak to a doll?
I'm a doll.
Really? I have a job for you.
Can you come to my place?
Our company is closed today.
What? Really?
I see…
Pardon me, but by the sound of your voice, you sound quite young.
What does age have to do with writing letters?
Don't dolls go wherever you ask them to?
Is that a lie?
No. It's not a lie.
Then come over!
Who is it?
I'm the doll from the CH Postal Company.
Oh, come in!
Excuse me.
I am pleased to meet you.
If it is your wish, I will travel anywhere to meet your request.
Auto memory doll Violet Evergarden at your service.
You really came.
I came as you requested.
You look young. Are you up to it?
I'll do my best.
Yuris!
Brother! We're here!
We're coming in!
Just a moment!
Hide! Hurry!
Hurry!
Brother!
Yuris, was someone just here?
No.
Oh, really? I thought I heard someone talking.
How are you feeling?
Stop asking me the same thing every day.
Are you okay?
If I were okay, I wouldn't be here.
Forgive me.
Brother!
I'll read you my story book!
I don't read story books. That's so stupid.
Your brother isn't feeling well.
It's worse than that.
I had three surgeries and been in the hospital for a whole year.
Yuris, Lucas said he wanted to come visit you.
He said he wants to see you.
I don't want him to.
Why not? You two were so close--
I said I don't want to see him!
What's this?
It's so old--
No! Don't touch that, stupid!
It… belongs to someone…
who came to visit the person in the next room.
I'm just holding on to it a bit.
I'm tired now!
Sorry.
We're going for a walk now.
Good idea. You get some sleep now.
We'll come again.
Sorry.
May I come out now?
Would you please explain…
why I had to stay hidden?
Young master.
You can call me Yuris.
All right, Yuris.
I want to write something without my mom, dad, and brother knowing about it.
Write a letter?
Yeah. Letters for the three of them.
Letters for them to read after I'm gone.
So I want you to hold onto them for a while after we finish.
Don't send them right away.
All right.
You know what I mean? Can you do stuff like that?
It's not a problem.
I handled a similar request in the past.
There was a girl who was a little younger than you.
Her mother wrote letters to her…
so that she'd receive a letter from her…
every year on her birthday for 50 years even after she was gone.
For 50 years? Does that mean there were 50 letters?
Yes.
Even now, she still receives one of those letters every year.
I'm sorry but I can't afford that many.
My money's in that tin. Write as many as it will pay for.
So how many can you write?
If it's three letters… I can write around 20 characters per letter.
Just 20 characters?
"Dear Mom… Take care. Yuris."
That's so short! Even I can write that much!
I need… I want the letters to make
my mom, dad, and brother feel better
after reading them!
Yuris. That is the standard fee.
My company has a special discount for children.
Therefore, the money in your tin will be enough
to pay for any letter you want me to write.
Is that really true!
It's true.
You're making it up!
I didn't make it up.
This special provision was created
so we can perform our duties during times of emergency.
It's our emergency provision.
I don't really get it.
But… It sounds cool!
It means "good!"
All right, let's get started!
Your hand.
I lost it in the war.
I was also in a hospital a few years ago.
Can you write letters with it?
It took a while to learn how to use this artificial hand.
It took a while to learn how to use this artificial hand. But I can use it fine now.
I can even do gestures like this.
You're kind of funny.
People always just say to me:
"How are you feeling?" "Are you okay?" "Go to sleep."
You're different from Mom, Dad, and the nurses.
How am I different?
People are always worrying about me, feeling sorry for me…
and being overprotective.
You know, I'm tired of that stuff.
Understood. I will try to eliminate those three elements from my emotions.
You really are funny.
All right. Well…
Write me a letter.
Write one to my father.
Your father?
Yeah. My father went off to the war.
He went to a country called Leidenschaftlich.
He said he'd come back soon, but he hasn't returned yet.
That's why I want to tell him that I, my brother, and my mother are all safe.
Can you write me a letter?
Let's invite Violet out for dinner.
Okay. Let's go to that one place.
That restaurant…
we all went to when Violet first got here.
It's you.
Captain Dietfried.
Lt. Colonel Hodgins.
No, I should call you president.
I always forget that the war has been over
for many years now.
What do you want?
Well…
Violet!
Captain.
Please excuse my… impertinence.
No. Don't worry about it.
Here.
Is that my…
Did you come to give that back to me?
I noticed you dropped it.
So the place that Violet went to was…
The graveyard…
where the major's mother is buried.
Captain. Thank you.
All right, then.
Let's dump our stuff and go eat!
Good idea.
Violet, will you join us?
Okay.
Hey!
My family has decided to get rid of the boat we owned.
The boat?
Yeah.
My brother… sailed in it many times when he was a child.
It contains many of his books and the toys he played with.
If there's anything you want…
Could I have them?
It's a bunch of junk, really.
I'm going! I'm going wherever the boat is docked!
I didn't know you went to her grave every month.
Should I have told you?
No.
You don't have to.
You're free to do as you like in your free time.
You're going… to visit the boat?
I'll tell you when I go.
I said you don't have to tell us.
Violet.
Shall I go with you?
I'll be fine. You may eliminate your pity, concern, and overprotectiveness of me.
You may eliminate your pity, concern, and overprotectiveness of me.
-She said she'll be fine. -Shut up! Just be quiet and eat!
Violet's right.
You can't worry about her all the time.
Of course I'm worried.
Dietfried, that bastard.
He's playing on Violet's broken heart.
He could be good for Violet.
They can share their memories of the major.
That man took advantage of Violet being an orphan
and used her as a tool during the war.
Is that why he shouldn't talk to her?
Even if he's not like that anymore?
Are you saying they should lick each other's wounds?
Would that be such a bad thing?
Violet still has feelings for the major.
I'm worried she's going to be crushed by those feelings unless we do something.
The captain may… bring comfort to her in a way that we can't.
You know… if I ever have kids someday,
I hope it's a boy.
My nerves won't be able to handle a girl!
This is one of the books he was crazy about.
He played many games with our father.
Did this belong to the major?
No. That's mine.
Excuse me.
You don't have to be so formal.
Yes.
You and the major must have sailed…
this ship often when you were children.
Yeah. Our father took us out.
My father was devoted to the military,
but he liked sailing as well.
That's the only thing I inherited from him.
This is our family's flower.
What does it matter?
What? What did you just say?
That's what you wanted to show us, right?
You wanted to show us this, so you could tell us to become like you.
Brother.
You just wanted to show us…
that this is our only choice!
Brother!
You, your father, and all of us in the Bougainvillea family
have no choice but to join the military!
Father, stop!
Don't hit Brother!
I'll do it!
I'll grow up to be like you!
Since I was so rebellious…
Gil had no choice but to listen to our father.
It's my fault. He couldn't choose his own life.
But I still treated him horribly.
I have… no siblings in my family,
so I don't entirely understand.
However, I can understand…
how someone could… have complicated feelings…
for someone they're close to.
You understand how other people feel?
Sorry, I wasn't trying to be sarcastic.
I know.
Is it okay if I keep the book and this board game?
Yes.
Let's go now.
Are you okay?
Thank you.
We've both lost something important.
Both you… and I.
Sorry about the other day.
For saying you'll never see him again, and telling you to forget him.
I can't forget him either.
After all… he's my little brother.
Yes.
If I could see him again… I would apologize for many things.
And many things I would talk to him about.
Yes.
Next, the letter for my brother.
I wonder what I should write to him, though.
Sion's still only five.
Why don't you tell him how you felt
when he was born?
Yeah.
I was so happy when he was born.
He was so warm and soft, like a freshly baked loaf of bread.
But then…
Did you start to feel like he stole your parents from you?
Did you feel jealous when your parents praised him instead of you?
You're right.
But you thought he was adorable whenever he chased you.
How did you know that?
I've heard other people talk about it.
Okay. After you write that, add this next:
"Live a full life in my place.
And in my place be good to Mom and Dad.
Have Mom and Dad…
spoil you in my place."
To me, it seems like you're saying things you don't mean.
What you really want is for your father and mother
to spoil you yourself.
You know everything.
I've written a lot of letters.
Words, attitudes, and feelings all have an outside and an inside.
I've begun to understand that what you see…
on the surface isn't everything.
And sometimes you have to tell people…
your true feelings, or they'll never know.
Look. How is this?
Thank you.
I'll hold on to the three letters and keep them safe.
Give them the letters on the day I go to heaven.
I'll ask the hospital to inform the post office.
Yes.
Hey, can you do a pinky swear?
A pinky swear?
Yeah.
You link pinkies… with each other.
And you swear… to keep your promise.
Thank you.
Your finger is so cold.
Even through my glove.
I'll probably go cold before the winter comes.
Still.
I think your letters will warm…
the hearts of your parents and brother.
I'll make sure I give them your letters.
Well, then, I've fulfilled my duties.
Wait!
There's one more… letter I want to write.
Is it for Lucas?
I was listening from under the bed.
If there's something you want to tell him, it's best to do it while you can.
You think so?
Yes.
I was… unable to ask and say everything I wanted.
To whom?
The person… who gave me "I love you."
Did that person die?
I believe… that he's still alive somewhere.
What did you want to tell him?
That I understand… what "I love you" means.
You understand? Is that all?
Lucas said…
he wanted to visit me.
But I told him not to.
Lucas and I have been close since we were little kids.
We always played together.
But then… my arms and legs… began…
to wither.
I don't want him… to see me like this.
I'll put… those feelings… in the letter for you.
As for the fee…
Yuris!
I'll get the nurse!
Let's leave the letter to Lucas for next time.
Sorry.
No problem.
Are these all the "lost letters"?
I took them from Roland.
I thought I'd return the letters whose senders we know.
So? Are you asking me to help you since I'm the president?
Young people these days don't like working overtime.
Look how hard I'm working. You should make me the vice president.
You should go to accounting school first.
Our vice president must understand the account books.
Whoa! Now, I know how to get promoted!
Then I might get serious.
Isn't this…
Yeah. This is the shelf where we keep recent mail.
This is the shelf where we keep recent mail.
This handwriting…
What's wrong?
No.
The sender's address is on the Island of Ecarte.
That island used to be occupied by Gardarik.
It gained independence after the war.
Why did you want to meet with me? President.
The other day…
Is it about that doll who works at your place?
Did she say something?
No.
Don't worry.
She left after she visited the boat.
She said that you'd be worried about her.
She said she'd tell me before she went.
You're not her guardian.
You have no right to control her.
You bastard! How dare you say that!
Sorry. I was wrong.
This is the only way I know how to talk.
I didn't come today talk about Violet.
Isn't this…
Can you look into it?
President.
Sorry to disturb you so late.
I need to talk to you about something.
What is it?
I… haven't confirmed it yet.
But… it's possible I'm wrong.
The major? Is it the major?
Yeah.
Have you news of him?
Have you received new information… about Major Gilbert?
Are you going to go now?
Yeah. It might be someone else, but I'm going.
All right! We'll take care of things here!
Violet… Are you okay?
Am I okay?
Is it okay if I see the major?
Is there anything wrong with me?
It's been so many years.
Do you think the major will recognize me?
Come on. Violet.
What should I say when I see him?
Tell him how I'm doing now?
Or tell him my feelings?
Will I be able to articulate it?
Am I being foolish?
Violet.
It's going to be a long journey, right?
Why not write a letter on the way there?
We're back, Daisy.
Sorry for being so late.
Daisy?
"I am going to Leiden for a while."
The country eventually nationalized…
all the postal companies. The one she worked for was turned into a museum.
The one she worked for was turned into a museum.
I wonder where she went after she quit.
Please take your time looking around.
I'm sorry. I didn't notice you there.
No problem.
If you have any questions, please ask me.
Okay.
Actually, I used to work here a long time ago as a receptionist.
Oh, really?
Yes.
Excuse me. What's this stamp?
Oh, yes.
This stamp is only issued on the island of Ecarte.
The island of Ecarte?
Did you say you used to work here?
Yes.
Oh, sea of blessing
Sea that connects to the entire world
The seagulls dance, in your skies
The fish swim, in your midst
The shellfish burrow, in your bottom
You give light
You nurture life
You pour out love
We continue to live close to you
Until we cease
We entrust our bodies to you
In the present In the past And in the future
It's supposed to be a ritual for giving thanks to the sea.
But it's become a day to mourn those who didn't return.
No one returned from the war.
The only people left on the island
are the old, the women, and the children.
They died at war instead of at sea.
I must apologize to our ancestors.
Our fathers were killed by those Leiden soldiers, right?
Yes.
I wish everyone in Leiden would die!
The hymn they just read
was dedicated at the Festival of Thanksgiving in Leiden.
They say it was written by a famous doll.
Violet Evergarden was her name.
Everyone! Come! It's time to eat!
Come on. Let's go!
Let's go!
Teacher! I love you!
Let's go!
Come on!
Major. It's been such a long time.
I've thought about you…
every single day, every single day while I couldn't see you.
I hope that my prayers will be answered…
that my wish will be granted…
and that I can see you again… someday.
Violet.
Can you wait here for a while?
I'm going too!
If… Gilbert really is… here now…
We don't know his current situation.
-So-- -I don't care!
You may not care.
I don't know about him.
I heard he's not using his real name here.
It's a small island.
He likely doesn't want to spread rumors.
Can you wait here?
I'll wait.
If I can see him again, I'll wait as long as it takes.
It's your first time here. Why don't you take a look around?
Understood.
I don't know who he is.
Hello!
Hello.
-Whose father are you? -I'm not…
-Then who are you? -You look creepy.
No. I'm from the postal company.
Oh! Then are you here to deliver a letter?
Yes.
Look! I've got something for you!
He's scared!
Let's go back!
I don't think I can handle a boy either.
Are you someone's sister?
-I'm-- -Are you a post-person?
Yes. That's right.
I knew it!
This is for you!
Here!
An insect. A praying mantis.
Aren't you scared?
It's missing… one of its front legs.
Just like Teacher Gilbert.
Is he also missing…
his right eye?
You know a lot!
He's your teacher? He's your teacher, right?
That's right.
Is your teacher…
doing well?
Yeah! He has no right hand but plays the bars with his left.
-And he can run really fast! -Yeah! He's really fast!
Right?
Can you…
please tell me more about him?
About your teacher?
Okay!
Our teacher… he's really nice!
He explains things over and over if you don't understand!
Who is it?
Come in.
If there's something you don't understand…
I never thought that…
You survived.
Gilbert.
I go by the name "Jilbert" here.
I see.
Sorry for visiting you so suddenly.
How did you find me?
You wrote a letter for a kid, right?
All the undeliverable letters get returned to the post office.
We check them a final time before returning them to the sender.
I came across your letter by chance.
Why… are you here?
After the battle…
I awoke lying in a hospital bed.
I didn't have my ID tags, so they sent me to a hospital run by a monastery.
I worked at the hospital for a while.
Then instead of returning home, I roamed around for a time.
I came here… a year ago.
I wrote letters at the children's request, and started teachingat this school.
I know my duty was to notify the military.
That doesn't matter.
Did you know that Violet is alive?
Yeah.
Then why didn't you come see her!
Violet!
She's been waiting this whole time!
I made her unhappy!
She's… better off without me.
She's here… as well.
She's waiting outside right now.
Do you have any idea how much she wanted to see you?
I can't see her.
Gilbert.
I can't see her. Never again.
My friend…
He's dead.
Gilbert Bougainvillea is dead.
That's what everyone thought.
And as the years went by, everyone accepted it.
Therefore… let me live a different life.
-Gilbert-- -We're…
in the middle of the grape harvest season.
I'm going to help them.
All the men on this island left for war.
And none of them returned.
Hodgins. Please. Leave.
I'll return. I'll come back.
Do you…
Do you hate me?
I don't understand your question.
Have I failed you in some way?
If there's something I'm doing wrong, I'll fix it! Please tell me!
No.
That's not true.
It's my fault. I said you're not a tool.
But I still… I still… used you.
Of course you can use me! I'm your weapon!
The battle is turning against us!
What should I do next?
Major! Give me your orders!
President!
It's him!
It's really him!
I talked to the children.
Did you not see him?
I did.
Was he hurt anywhere besides his arm and eye?
No.
Then… I can see him, right!
He said…
he can't see you.
Is he still working?
I'll wait until he's finished.
That's not it.
-Then I'll wait until nighttime. -Violet!
Then… then tomorrow.
Right.
I'll go see him tomorrow and try to talk to him.
He must… he has to see you.
Does… that mean…
not that he can't see me?
But that he doesn't… want to see me?
Why not?
I can't really explain it.
He said it's better that way for you both.
It can't be.
I… I…
Violet.
Violet!
Once you're done, it'll be easy to move the grapes to the top.
You've been a big help.
It looks like we'll have heavy rain.
Major!
Major!
I found him.
Major.
Major.
Major! Major!
Major!
I'm sorry I came… to your house.
Major. If you've been alive…
why haven't you contacted me?
Why didn't you come to see me?
I want to… Major, I want to see you.
I want to continue talking where we left off.
I've begun to understand…
the meaning of "I love you."
Go away.
Go away!
I'll wait.
I'll wait here…
until I can see you.
You don't… need me now.
And… if I'm with you… I will remember…
taking you to the battlefield when you were so young…
how you… lost both of your arms…
because of my orders.
Major. Do you regret…
that I exist?
It must be… that I am…
causing you pain.
I can understand… how you must feel now, Major.
I don't understand everything.
But I understand… a little.
You idiot!
You can have these.
We are grateful.
There was nowhere else for us to stay.
It's a small island. We don't even have an inn.
Violet said this lighthouse functions as a post office as well.
I see…
how the season has come again with the bloom of this flower.
"The prince's eyes were like blue sapphires.
The sword at his side was decorated with sparkling red rubies."
You've gotten pretty good at reading.
Violet.
Stay by my side.
Stay by my side at all times, Violet.
Okay.
Are you from the Leiden postal company?
Yes.
Is Violet Evergarden the girl
who was with you just now?
Your postal company got a call from the hospital.
There's a boy named Yuris who is in critical condition.
Yuris? -Who's that? -He's one of my…
-Who's that? -He's one of my…
customers.
Give them the letters on the day I go to heaven.
Yes.
I'm going back.
I'm going back to Leiden.
Violet!
You can't go back in the middle of a storm!
The boats can only leave tomorrow morning at the earliest.
You'll see Gilbert.
Right?
I want to see him.
I want to see him!
But!
I made a pinky promise!
Yuris. I promised him.
And there's still one letter I haven't written yet.
But it's going to take you at least three days to get back.
-Can't you go faster! -I'm going as fast as I can!
Benedict and Iris left for the hospital to deliver the letters you were keeping.
Good.
Excuse me.
Yuris. The doll is here.
You want her to write a letter, right?
Vio… let?
I'm Iris. I came instead.
Violet is somewhere far away right now.
She is reuniting with the one who's dear to her.
Is it the person… who taught her "I love you"?
That's right.
He's still alive.
Good.
I've heard about you.
You want to write Lucas a letter, right?
Yeah.
What do you want me to write?
Yuris!
Yuris!
Yuris. You'll be okay.
Yes! Please connect me!
Please!
Yuris. It's Lucas.
What am I supposed to do
with this?
You say, "Hello."
Yuris!
Yeah.
Hello.
Lucas.
Yeah!
Lucas, I'm sorry I told you not to come.
And that I didn't want to see you.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Why are you apologizing!
I…
I was sad when I heard you didn't want to see me.
But I thought it was what you wanted.
So I tried hard.
But… I couldn't help myself.
And I went to the hospital many times.
And I saw your face in the window a little.
Sorry… for saying something… so mean.
No.
I'm not… mad at you at all.
Yuris.
We've always been friends, right?
Let's continue being friends forever.
Good.
Thank you.
That horrible device comes in handy sometimes.
Yuris!
Yuris!
Yuris!
She wasn't… able to write the letter.
But he was able to speak… with Lucas on the telephone one last time.
And tell him… what he wanted to say.
"I'm sorry." "Thank you."
And they delivered the letters you wrote…
for his parents and brother.
"Mom, Your… pancakes were so delicious.
If I had eaten more vegetables,
I could have… made you happier."
"Dad, It was fun going fishing and camping.
Mom… Dad, I'm so glad… I was born as your son.
I love you.
Yuris."
There's also a letter for his little brother.
Me?
"Sion.
Sorry for the times I got mad at you or was mean to you.
But… I was really happy
when you were born."
"Thanks for letting me become an older brother.
Live a full life in my place.
And take care… of Mom and Dad in my place.
Have fun with them.
And have them spoil you…
my dear brother.
From your older brother."
Thank you, brother!
I'm so happy!
Mom and Dad are you happy too?
Yeah.
Yes.
Thank you. Yuris.
They said Yuris was glad you were able to meet the person…
who is dear to you.
Let's visit him again in the morning.
If he doesn't come out, I'll kick down his door
and give him a good thrashing!
No.
If he's to be struck… then I'll do it.
-What? -I'm kidding.
I'm going back to the postal company…
on the next boat.
I'll return to writing letters.
There is much work I have left.
Violet.
The major is alive and safe.
I thought I'd never see him again.
But I was… able to hear his voice.
I'm…
That's…
enough for me.
All right, give it a try.
There it is! It's coming up!
That's amazing.
This will make things a lot easier.
It's the old man and the girl from the postal company!
Old man?
Hey! Our teacher made that machine!
Isn't it great?
-Look, there's a lot! -Can it hold more?
It's great!
Awesome! I wanna try it.
Right? It's amazing, right?
Yes.
Will you… please give this to your teacher?
Okay! I'll make sure I give it to him!
Bye!
It's not your burden to bear alone.
All the young men from our island left.
And lots of people died in the war.
We're probably all to blame.
We all thought our lives would be better…
once we won the war.
We all hated the people from Leidenschaftlich.
But…
we all suffered in the end.
All of us.
If you have a home somewhere else you should go back.
No. I'm staying here.
Staying forever.
Having you here is a big help to us all.
Hey!
Have you finally been able to choose your own path on this island?
It sure looks like a nice place.
Brother.
You've been living a carefree life.
And you didn't even come to our mother's funeral.
They were fond of you, unlike me.
Sorry.
Meanwhile, Violet has been visiting our mother's grave in your place.
She still visits every month even now.
I was… planning on apologizing to you…
if I ever saw you again.
But right now…
I ought to stuff you in a sack…
and drag you off to see Violet!
I shouldn't have…
taken her in back then.
Then what did you really want to do?
I wanted her to have…
fun while she was young…
to be able to enjoy…
pleasant things…
to allow her heart…
to be inspired… by beauty.
I wanted… to provide her with that.
But I…
It's for you. Read it.
Dearest Major Gilbert,
Please forgive me for visiting you so suddenly.
This is… my last letter… to you.
The reason… I'm alive today…
and learned how to love others…
is all thanks to you.
For… accepting me… I thank you.
Thank you for reading to me.
For teaching me how to read, and showing me many things…
I thank you.
For the brooch you gave me…
I thank you.
For always…
always keeping me by your side…
I thank you.
With all my heart…
For giving me "I love you"…
I thank you.
Hearing you tell me "I love you"…
has been like a guiding light in my life.
Since I've learned what "I love you" means…
I wanted to tell you that I love you.
Major.
I thank you.
Thank you.
I thank you for everything.
We all struggle… with being true to ourselves.
I will carry the Bougainvillea family name.
You may be free.
Go.
Violet!
Violet!
Major?
Gilbert.
Major!
Violet!
Major.
Violet.
I'm not your master or your superior officer anymore.
I hurt you.
I'm not… the man you think I am.
I'm not a good master… or a good person.
I don't… deserve you.
But even now…
Still… Still I…
I love you.
I…
I want you to stay with me. Violet.
I…
Major.
Major.
I…
Violet. Don't cry.
You see? I'm… I'm about to cry too.
I want to wipe away your tears.
Please. Lift your face.
I…
Major…
Major…
I love you… Violet.
I've always wanted to do this.
After wrapping up her remaining work…
she quit her job at the postal company…
and took over the postal service at the lighthouse on the island.
Afterwards, the post office moved to the main street.
Once telephones became common, the dolls ceased their work.
But I'm sure she wrote many letters…
for the people who lived on the island.
Meanwhile…
This stamp was issued by the CH Postal Company Memorial Foundation,
and is only sold on this island.
The island holds the record for the most letters sent each year per person.
for the most letters sent each year per person.
A long time ago, it used to be a job done by women called dolls.
There was a popular doll who lived on this island and who everyone loved.
Her name was…
Violet Evergarden.
She had also written letters which my grandmother received.
If there's something I can't say…
maybe I could tell them in a letter.
I want to tell them my true feelings.
The people I want to tell my feelings…
are... only here in this moment.
Dad.
Mom.
Thank you.
♪ You show them you're outside… ♪
I know what you're thinkin'. How did a guy like me land a girl like her?
-We get this all the time. -We've been friends forever.
[Dunk] I've always had a crush on her.
But society has deemed it socially unacceptable -for a tall girl to date a short guy. -[sighs]
Tell me about it. I mean, I was constantly bullied for being tall.
-How's the weather up there? -Especially by my tormentor, Kimmy.
-Nice sweatpants, Sasquatch. -[all giggling]
[Jodi] It felt like a curse.
Then this Swedish exchange student named Stig showed up--
-[Dunk] And stayed with my family. -[Jodi] He was even taller than me.
They dated for a bit, but he totally played her.
[Jodi] Yeah, he did, and he humiliated me in front of our entire class.
She's, uh, secretly in love with me.
What?
Don't worry, I stepped in. I stood up for her…
She is so much cooler than all you guys combined.
Took a punch to the face. It was no big deal.
-[chuckles] It was a big deal. -It was a big deal.
Yeah, I mean…
He was the one who gave me the confidence to stand up for myself
with the sweetest gift. [chuckles]
After that, I owned my height.
And homecoming was a big step for me.
Uh, hi. I-- I'm Jodi.
You may know me as "Amazon" or "Jodi the Green Giant."
Being tall actually is what makes me me, and I-- I like me.
[Jodi] My best friend Fareeda
and my sister Harper were there, cheering me on.
And that's when she realized…
That he was the one I was supposed to be with all along.
Mm-hm, which makes sense, considering I carried around a milk crate for my entire life,
considering I carried around a milk crate for my entire life, waiting for my chance to kiss her.
[Jodi] Which finally happened about three months ago.
[Dunk] And it's been bliss ever since.
Would the lady care--
[yells] My back!
Unfortunately, the milk crate's no longer with us.
Which is why I am buying him a backpack for our three-month anniversary.
Are you sure you don't mind leaning down to kiss me?
Yeah, I'm sure.
-Sorry, we were just babbling. -Yeah, what was the question again?
What brings you in today?
-Well, the backpack. -Yeah, this one.
You like this one, right?
-Yeah. -Okay.
-Hey. -I got you a smoothie.
-Oh, thank you. -Of course.
-Jodi! -Mikey! -What's up? -[Mikey] What up, girl?
-Hey-- -[Jodi] Oh, here.
I got you. There you go.
Suzie!
I need to know where you got that top now.
Fareeda Marks. Remember the name.
-Thought she was talking about mine. -It's cute.
Can I buy you a cup of coffee some time?
Hey. Boyfriend. Right here.
Didn't know. Just moved here.
Keep moving.
But I've never given a speech in class before.
Just go out there and do your best, and if you mess up, just know it's okay.
Jodi! It's up!
Big moment.
Guys.
I know you said not to make a big deal out of this…
-[both] But we didn't listen! -It's just an audition.
That you've been wanting to do since middle school.
This is a moment to commemorate.
[Stig] Hey!
This is not.
-[Jodi] Hey. -Wow. What are we celebrating?
We aren't celebrating anything, because we are no longer friends.
-Keep walking, IKEA. -Oh!
We're, uh-- We're celebrating my name on that audition list.
Bye Bye Birdie? Wow.
That's my second favorite musical! After Guys and Dolls.
Dunk, wanna know my third favorite?
[laughs] Oh my God! I don't care.
Okay.
[Stig] Okay.
See you guys later.
Knuckle touch?
Handshake?
[Dunk] See you at home.
I can't believe he's trying to be friends with us after torturing you with his sick, twisted mind games.
after torturing you with his sick, twisted mind games.
I cannot believe that you forgave him after everything.
He's apologized to us multiple times. Can you just give him a break?
-No. -No. He's the worst.
-To Jodi. -[chuckles] To Jodi.
-To me. -[Fareeda chuckles]
-Mmm. Apple cider, a classic. [gargling]
Hi.
Hello. [chuckles]
I'm Tommy.
I know. [chuckles]
I saw you in Hairspray last year.
-You were amazing. -[laughs]
-Thank you. [laughs] -It was really good.
I'm Jodi, by the way.
[Tommy] I know.
I'm a fan of your work too.
-My work? -Yeah.
"So go ahead and… and keep calling me names."
"Keep making fun of me. Keep asking me,
'How's the weather up there?' Because the weather up here is great."
-Mm-hm. Yeah. -It's from your homecoming speech.
You remember it.
I do. Yeah, every word.
How? [laughs]
Let's just say you are extremely memorable.
-[boy] Hey, man. Watch it. -[Stig] Oh, sorry. Sorry.
-Phew. -Jeez.
-[sighs] -You okay?
Yeah. Just a little on edge.
I've heard you sing. You have nothing to be nervous about.
You'll do great.
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
Auditioning. Same as you.
Madeline has already cast me in lead roles multiple times,
so this is really more of a formality than an audition.
-Jodi Kreyman. -Yeah.
-[Madeline] You're up. -Okay.
-You're gonna do great. -Thanks.
[Kimmy] Try to relax…
'cause you don't stand a chance.
Miss me, Stiggy baby?
[sighs] Kimmy.

So you've never performed on stage before?
Never.
What about that speech you gave at the homecoming dance?
Oh, uh… Well, I wouldn't call that a performance. [laughs]
But you were on stage, in front of a huge crowd,
delivering what was essentially an improvised monologue. Isn't that performing?
I guess it is. [chuckles]
What would you say to people who don't think that being tall is a real problem?
Excuse me?
Getting a terminal illness, being homeless,
not knowing where your next meal is coming from…
Those are real problems.
But you seem to have so much going for you.
What do you have to complain about?
Well, I'm not saying being tall is worse than those things.
It's just sometimes it feels like it is, but I know that it's not.
It just… doesn't make all the bad things that have happened to me every day of my entire life any less real.
that have happened to me every day of my entire life any less real.
Performing has always been my dream,
but I didn't think I could do it, until now.
Okay.
Thank you for coming in.
-[soft piano music] -[man] Wait a second, Harper.
-You were offered a job? -[Harper] Mm-hm.
Like a real job?
Like with money?
-Yes. With benefits and a parking space… -Whoo!
…and $401,000.
No, I think you mean a 401(k).
-Mmm… Agree to disagree. -That's usually--
Wait. What is this job?
Say hello to the co-host

How dare you? Come on.
Congrats.
Thank you. Oh, by the way, the job is in LA.
Louisiana?
-You're moving to California? -Los Angeles?
Sorry, just wanted to rip the Band-Aid off.
Every time she speaks, it's like I'm getting punched in the face.
-Let's have another baby. -I'm very fertile.
Okay, this is my chance to prove to myself
and everyone else that I have more to offer this world than just--
Yeah.
That I'm more than just shiny hair -and perfectly exfoliated skin. -[phone alert]
-I'm someone to be taken seriously. -Yes, you are.
-[Harper] Which is why-- -[screams] Oh my God, I got the lead! Oh!
What?
-Sorry. I did not mean to cut you off. -Uh, no, no, I was done. What lead?
The spring musical.
The director just texted me, and I'm playing Kim in Bye Bye Birdie.
-What? -What?
Look at my girls! Both headed for greatness.
Look at my girls! Both headed for greatness. -[mom] Oh! -[dad] Aah!
I gotta-- I gotta text Dunk.
-Oh yeah. -[laughing]
Dad, you-- you text my boyfriend?
-[mom] Oh yeah. -Well, seven, eight times a day, max.
-That's weird. -Strange.
Oh! We're gonna throw you a huge party for opening night.
No, please. No party.
-Yes. You are getting a party! -Yes.
-[parents] Party! Party! Party! -No. No…
-[Jodi] No. -[mom] How do you feel about floats?
-[Jodi] No. -[mom] Theme - birds.
-You said 12, right? -Thank you. There you go.
-And, uh… -[seller] Thanks.
And whatever this fine couple wants. It's on me.
Toppings are included.
-[woman] That's so sweet. -No problem. We're having a big night.
-[woman] That's so sweet. -No problem. We're having a big night. -We're celebrating, so… [chuckles] -Yeah.
-So, treating yourself to two scoops? -You know my motto.
-So, treating yourself to two scoops? -You know my motto. -Taller is always better. -Ah.
Speaking of taller, what's she, like, six-two, six-three?
-Rude. -No.
No, no, no, rude. You know what? Excuse me.
No, no, no, rude. You know what? Excuse me. -Hold on. No more toppings for you. -No, no, no, it's cool. Thank you.
Enjoy your toppings, guys. Okay.
[Jodi] It's okay.
-Really? -Yeah.
Three months ago, that really would have bothered you.
Probably.
And, uh, also three months ago,
you could barely speak in front of a crowd.
But now you're going to be performing in front of the whole school.
[sighs] Yeah.
I mean, as the star of the show.
A night that will change your whole life.
Yeah. Yeah… Um…
But thank you for believing I could do it, even when I didn't.
You're gonna crush it.
Thanks.
Cheers.
Cheers.
[voice] You don't deserve this part.
You got lucky.
-[crickets chirping] -[voice] You finally got your dream.
You think you can actually pull this off?
So this voice just pops into your head last night while brushing your teeth,
and now it won't go away?
Yeah.
Have you heard it before?
Well, I mean, there's always been a voice, but nothing like this.
I mean, this one, it's just--
Louder? Crueler? Makes you believe your worst fears and insecurities are true?
Yes!
What?
I was… afraid this might happen.
I prayed it wouldn't, but if only I'd prayed harder.
What are you talking about?
That voice!
That negative voice in your head,
the one that tells you that you're a fraud,
and all the wonderful things happening in your life aren't because you're talented or smart.
aren't because you're talented or smart.
It's just because you're lucky.
But why would it happen now?
[laughs] Because now you're out there,
risking failure and humiliation,
and the more out there you are,
the louder that voice gets.
So how do I make it stop?
You can't.
It's just a horrible part of life that never goes away.
Like Maroon 5.
-[sniffs] Ugh, allergies. -Wait, so you get it too?
[laughs] No! No! No. No, no, no, no, no.
But I've been in 37 beauty pageants.
And every single time, I'd see that voice tear someone apart so badly,
they couldn't even step foot on stage.
So you're saying that that… that could be me?
I'm saying there's no worse bully than the one you create in your own head.
You have to control it. Otherwise, it could eventually get worse
and control you.
Okay. [sighs]
You cast Jodi as the lead and me as her understudy?
Theater is about taking risks.
I cast Jodi as the lead because she possesses
a rawness and authenticity that the role desperately needs.
So I'm just supposed to sit back in rehearsals and watch?
There are no small parts, Kimmy, just small actors.
Well, that's nice to know.
[yells] 'Cause one thing Jodi definitely is not is a small actor!
I'm sorry, Kimmy.
[scoffs] Oh, this isn't over. I'm just getting started.
Oh, I'm afraid to ask.
All we have to do is humiliate Jodi so badly
on the first day of rehearsal that she drops out.
For instance, I'm just pitching, you slip NyQuil into one of the smoothies Dunkleman makes her so she passes out.
into one of the smoothies Dunkleman makes her so she passes out.
-Or did you see that movie Carrie? -Mm-hm.
She gets a bucket of pig guts dropped on her from the rafters.
"Bye Bye Jodi."
I don't know where I would get pig guts.
-[chuckles] -Then Google it. -What? -Doing your dirty work…
-What? -Doing your dirty work… It's just starting to make me feel a little, well… well, dirty.
-Where is this coming from? -Ever since we lost Liz, I just…
I-- I can't stop thinking about how fragile life is.
She didn't die! Her mom got a new job, and they moved to Seattle.
Okay, but still, it's like one day, your best friend is right here,
and then the next, they're gone.
I don't know what to tell you, Schnip. This is who I am.
And if you can't have my back when I need you the most, then…
maybe this friendship has run its course.
Maybe it has.
Wait, what?
Maybe I need to find out who I am on my own,
instead of as your sidekick. That's all I've ever been.
Be well. Try and remember the good times.
You try and remember the good times! [scoffs]
-[Dunk] What do you think of this color? -[Jodi] So beautiful. I'm snapping it all.
-[Dunk] I don't know if I'm feeling 'em. -[Jodi] No? -I really think they look great on you. -Hey, Fareeda.
-I really think they look great on you. -Hey, Fareeda.
Is this me?
I don't know, Stig. Who are you?
I-- I'm sorry, I just can't believe that you invited Stig out today with us.
He didn't get a part in the show.
He's been really down, and, I don't know, he has no one to hang out with, so…
Sounds like a him problem, not a me problem.
Okay, if I am able to give him a second chance,
you should be able to give him a first one.
Let's be honest, you never really did.
-[Dunk] Right after I make this call. -That shirt is sick.
Oh, thank you. [chuckles]
Where'd you get it?
Actually, my best friend Fareeda designed it.
-Hi. -Yeah, and she's amazing. [chuckles]
She knows the three Fs like nobody's business.
You know the three Fs?
Form, fit, function. Come on.
I replaced having a social life with watching Queer Eye. Okay?
Can you bring me a few of these?
You mean, to sell?
-Yeah. -Oh, I have so many more.
-Tons more. -Even way cooler ones.
Like way, way cooler.
Then I guess you'll have to bring those too.
I will.
That was amazing. I'm so proud of you.
I'm so proud of us. Look at us, girl bosses bossin' it up.
-It's amazing. -We're livin' the dream.
-Boom. -Whoo! High five!
Medium five? Or low?
This is only because you said that nice thing about me.
[Dunk] So I got you some things for your first day.
Here you go. It's three water bottles.
-You can put those anywhere. -Thank you.
Some throat coat tea, and a kettle to warm up the water for the throat coat tea,
'cause otherwise, you're just drinkin' water.
Some, uh… Some lozenges, which, if you could take those right there.
-Cool. -Oh, but that's not all.
And a snack. I know you like to snack. Last but not least,
I got you a pitch pipe for singing.
I got myself one too, because they're awesome.
-[giggles] Right. -[blows note]
That's beautiful! [laughs]
-Thank you. This is perfect. -Yeah?
I just want you to have a good first rehearsal, and I'll just… I'll be… hangin' out until you're done.
I'll be… hangin' out until you're done.
You must have something better to do than sit around and wait for me.
[laughing] Yeah! I do.
I have to feed my fish.
You don't have a fish.
-I have to buy a fish. And then feed it. -[chuckles]
-Okay. -For sure.
Whew. Here I go.
Good luck.
Thank you.
-[girl 1] Hi! -[girl 2] Hi!
-Okay. -[voice] You're way out of your league.
And they all know it.
Kimmy should be the lead.
-[girl] Kimmy! -[echoing] And you know it… know it…
[Jodi] Oh, shoot. Sorry. Sorry.
Hello, Kim. We meet again.
It's-- It's Jodi, actually.
But you're playing Kim, and I'm playing Conrad.
-Yeah. Right. -Let me help you with all this, please.
-Thank you. -Jeez.
-Got a lot. -Oh, yeah. Yeah, you do.
-Okay… -Aah…
Seen the rehearsal schedule? -No, not yet. -Oh, it's nuts.
-No, not yet. -Oh, it's nuts. We're basically spending every second together for the next month, so…
Yeah. You're gonna get sick of seeing my face, I'm sorry.
No, you're gonna get sick of seeing my face.
That's impossible.
No, seriously, you're just gonna look at me one day and be like… [babbles]
I'm really nervous. Sorry, I don't know if you can tell. I just--
-It's fine. [laughs] -Right. Okay.
It's just tall people aren't really known for their coordination.
You got this.
[woman] Goodbye.
-Oof! -Oh my God. -[phone jangles] -Oh!
Jodi, you have the first line.
Oh, I must have missed that. Sorry.
-Yeah, along with the rest of your lines. -♪ Oh yeah ♪ -♪ Oh yeah ♪ -♪ Goin' steady for me ♪
[Madeline] Let's try that again.
-Sorry. Shoot! Sorry, sorry, sorry. -Oh!
-[piano keys jangle] -You're making it worse!
-Christian! -It's fine. See?
[murmurs] Sorry.
First week of rehearsals is the hardest.
Especially with you trying to psych me out from the sidelines.
-There's no shame in quitting. -Why would I quit?
Because when the time comes
for you to be standing on stage in front of a packed audience,
blinded by the lights, sweat pouring down your face,
you know deep down you'll choke.
Hey, she won't choke. She's gonna be amazing.
Whatever. You two deserve each other.
Hey, look, I don't know why you just stuck up for me but… thank you.
Yeah, my pleasure.
Yeah, so, um,
do you ever think about that time we kissed?
[laughs] No.
Right. Me too.
Every day. [chuckles]
I'm just…
-[beeping] -[Dunk] Oh! -Oh no. Oh! -[clattering]
Aah! Asparagus! Okay, come on. Come on. Oh boy.
Please.
Oh no!
Oh, come on. Come on, come on!
Ah, no! You burned the chicken stuffed in the duck stuffed in the turkey?
It's a turducken, Dad. Yeah, I ruined it. I told you to go with roasted chicken. You flew too close to the sun.
I told you to go with roasted chicken. You flew too close to the sun. -I didn't want to play safe. I don't know. -What is burning in here?
-I didn't want to play safe. I don't know. -What is burning in here?
The dinner I'm making for Jodi, who'll be here in an hour.
-Ooh, what's the occasion? -Three-month anniversary.
That's so massive at your age, and now the night is a tur-dumpster fire.
-How is that helpful? -Sorry. At all?
-Mm-hm. -I got you, Dunkers Seniors.
[dad] You two boys work it out. Don't get me in trouble with Mom.
Hey. Hey, man. What are you doing?
We've less than an hour to cook. Not much, Dunkers.
-Give me a hand and chop these onions. -Oh.
Onions? Are you trying to sabotage me?
I need them in the pan ASAP if they're to caramelize. Chop-chop.
I haven't talked to you in months. Now you'll help me?
Do you want to impress your girlfriend, or sit here and chitchat? Hmm?
Yes, chef. Sorry, chef.
For your first course, Dunkers here has prepared bruschetta
topped with roasted tomatoes, caramelized onions,
and if I may be so bold, it pairs very nicely with the iced teas.
I hope you enjoy.
-I'm going to go check on the pasta. Ciao. -[both laugh]
-I'm going to go check on the pasta. Ciao. -[both laugh] [Jodi] What was that?
He offered to wait on us. I wasn't gonna turn him down.
[laughs] Just make sure you-- you leave him a nice tip.
-I thought you were paying. -Am I now?
-Dad? Dad, what are you doing? -You're just killing it right now.
Okay, bounce now.
-There you go. Thank you, Dad. -[shutter clicks]
-Okay. [laughs] -I don't know!
Before we eat, I'd like to make a toast. Okay.
I just want to say how happy I am
to be sitting here with you tonight.
And to watch you face your fears
and chase this big dream
of performing in front of people
is truly inspiring.
[voice] A dream that you know will never happen. -[echoing] …never happen… -[Stig] Dunkers…
Once you bomb, he'll say, "Bye Bye Jodi… Bye Bye Jodi…"
So enjoy tonight,
because there won't be a four-month anniversary.
-Anniversary… -Jodi? Jodi!
Yeah! Yeah.
Are you okay? I'm sorry. It looked like you were spacing out.
-I'm sorry. My-- -It's okay.
My mind is just… elsewhere.
I'm under so much pressure for the show, but I've been looking forward to this night.
No, don't worry about it. I get it.
Look, if you need this time to rehearse or memorize your lines…
I don't know your process--
-No, no, I'm not-- -But whatever you need to do.
I'm not leaving in the middle of our anniversary dinner, okay?
Well, if you felt like you needed to, I would understand.
How did I get so lucky?
Pretty amazing.
-Thank you. -Yeah.
-Right. -Okay.
What? Huh?
What? Wait… Wh…
Are you actually leaving?
Well, you just-- You just said you didn't mind.
Yeah. Okay.
-So you do mind? -A little.
Then you just… You shouldn't have said it.
I didn't think you would actually do it.
Pasta primavera!
Fine. I'll stay.
-Don't do me any favors. -What is that supposed to mean?
Uh, parmigiano. No?
No.
-Okay. -[Dunk scoffs]
Jodi, you're like Miss Popular now at school.
Every time we walk down the hallway, it's always, "Jodi!" "Mikey!"
"Hey, can I buy you coffee sometime?" I mean,
why would the star of the spring musical have time for little old Dunks anymore?
-[sighs] -Am I a burden to you? -That's what it feels like. -No.
I just didn't know that's how you feel.
Do you know how many candles I lit for this? This was a big deal.
I've actually lost my appetite, so…
I'm gonna go.
Come on.
-Want me to wrap something up for you? -[Jodi] No, I'm okay. Thanks, Stig.
Let me just grab one with a flash. And there's my handsome boy.
You should go over there right now and talk it out.
But he is the one who said it was okay that I left.
No, Jodi, he was being nice.
You are the ones who are always telling me to stand up for myself.
Why should I be the first to crack?
There is no shame in cracking first.
-Actually, there is. -Yeah.
Were you guys eavesdropping?
If you crack first, Dunkleman is gonna hold all the cards in the relationship.
Now, I know you kids think that love is about communication and give-and-take.
-Well, it's not. -No.
[mom] Relationships are about power.
-Who has it, and who doesn't. -That's right.
So I say, let Dunkleman sweat it out, and you focus on your show.
Oh, which reminds me, we need 27 tickets for opening night.
-No, wait, 28. Dr. Seeger. -Oh. Right.
You invited my pediatrician?
Eh-- Look, I text Dunkleman, and I invited your pediatrician.
Please, let me live.
Dr. Seeger probably saw me on the Tok.
-[dad] Huh? -[mom] The Tickety Tok.
I was doin' all of that. I was plugging your show, though.
-You're on TikTok? -You don't follow me?
Jodi, focus!
What's it gonna be?
Don't worry, they're gonna sell.
-I'm not worried. -I mean, it's only been a week.
Which is why I'm not worried.
-And you shouldn't be either. -I just-- I can't help it. I'm a worrier.
Yes, we've met.
Lookin' beautiful as ever, Kim.
You're too kind, Conrad. [chuckles]
Who was that?
My costar.
Conrad?
No. Tommy. Conrad is his character name.
Well, Tommy thinks you're beautiful.
No. That was just his character saying that to my character, Kim.
Well, this is Fareeda telling Jodi that Tommy thinks you're beautiful.
Explain to me again why you can't crack first?
Because I've been chasing her my entire life.
If I just hold my ground, I can win this fight.
-Nobody wins in this kind of fight. -This is America. There's always a winner.
-Nobody wins in this kind of fight. -This is America. There's always a winner. [Stig] Pfft. And a loser.
There's my guy!
So, I know things got a little heated the other day,
and we said some things we didn't mean,
and I think we should just forget it even happened.
And to sweeten the deal, I promise to lay off Jodi the Green Giant.
Do you know why I joined the crew?
It's because I saw how upset you were when you didn't get the lead.
And I knew that having a friend by your side during rehearsals
would help you through it.
Name one time you've been there for someone who needed you.
What, you want, like, specific dates?
If we're gonna be friends, I need to know you've changed,
something you've made clear you don't wanna do.
But I believe that you have a good heart,
so I hope you'll reconsider.
Wait. You're making me eat lunch alone?
On some level, we all eat lunch alone.
-Oh, this is going to be so uncomfortable. -Why?
'Cause I don't do well with open tension.
-Can you just be cool, please? -All right.
-Can you just be cool, please? -All right. -Mr. Cool Guy reporting for duty. -Oh, Stig.
-Okay, come on. Somebody crack! -[hits table]
Dude, I had it.
I have nothing to say to him.
-You've got nothing to say to me? -No.
Not even, say, an apology? For bailing on our anniversary dinner?
You said I could.
You know, maybe instead of attacking each other,
you could try to articulate what it is you want.
-Fareeda, excellent point. -Mmm. Let's unpack our wants.
Okay, fine. What I want is a girlfriend with a better work-life balance.
I don't know what you want.
A girlfriend with a better work-life balance. I said!
So if two people just aren't getting what they want out of a relationship,
what are they supposed to do?
Typically, they break up.
Stig.
I-- I mean, not they should break up. I just-- Oh my--
-I don't know, man. Clearly, she wants to. -Now he's projecting.
I just think that you wanna break up, and you don't have the guts to say it.
-You don't think I have the guts? -I don't think you have!
-I have the guts. -Really? Then say it!
You say it, if you have the guts to say it.
Fine. I want to break up!
-Great. -[Dunk] Great!
Why did I do that?
-[sighs] -I love citrus.
[Fareeda] Stig.
You would make a horrible therapist.
Yeah, I was pretty bad.
My dad's outside. He needs to see me.
Is everything okay?
[Dunk] Yeah, he's right here.
-Is everything okay? What's wrong? -Hold on. -I don't know. -Why are you here?
-Surprise! -[Stig] Oh my--
-Surprise! -[Stig] Oh my-- -What? -[girl laughing] Aaaah!
[Stig, in Swedish] What are you doing here? Visiting you,
dummy!
Who is this person?
-Stig's sister. -His sister?
Oh no. You rented more Swedes?
We thought he'd appreciate having some family around,
since you've been ignoring him for three months.
I didn't know he had a sister.
That's because you don't talk to him.
Everyone, this is Stella.
Stella, this is Fareeda, and Jodi,
and that is Dunkers.
Dunkers?
Hey. Hi.
Oh, you're even more adorable than your pictures.
-I am? -Yeah.
He is?
And I can't believe I'm meeting the girl who broke my little brother's heart.
-Well-- -He called me that night in tears.
-It was allergies. -"Who's going to love me?"
I was a mess.
Oh, I can't wait for you to show me the city! Aah!
I've got time now. Who's gonna come?
[chuckles] I've got PE.
-Calculus. -Oof.
-What about you, Dunkers? -Uh… Hm? Me?
Dunkers is in.
-[Stig] Yes! -[Dunk] Yeah!
-Slam dunk! Whoo! -[Stella] Let's do this.
-Yes! [chuckles] -Come on.
[dad] Seat belts, gang. Seat belts.
All right, Dad. Come on, back off.
How was school today, bud? Who'd you play with?
[voice] Looks like there's a new tall girl in town.
And she just drove off with your boyfriend… boyfriend…
Sorry, ex-boyfriend. Perfect timing.
-[Fareeda] Jodi? -Yeah?
Are you okay?
Dunk and I just… just broke up.
Aw, Jodi.
So, how's Ingvar?
-[retches] -Amazing. -[Stig] Ew. -He says hi.
-[Stig] Ew. -He says hi.
Wait, are you guys talking about Ingvar Kruger?
You know Ingvar?
Stig said he's the best-looking, coolest guy in your entire country.
-Are you guys dating? -Yes, and he completes my soul.
Well, cherish each other.
Because at any moment, it could just all be over.
He and Jodi broke up.
-That can't be! -[Dunk groans] You two are destined to be together.
-Destined to be together? -That's what Stig told me.
What? When?
The night he called to say he blew it with Jodi.
He said that what made the whole thing even worse
was he blew his chance to be friends with you.
-He doesn't have many of those back home. -You never said anything.
You never asked.
I guess you're kind of right.
I never asked about your friends or your family or anything about you.
I think I kind of blew my chance of being friends with you too.
You did, you jerk.
-Course not, Dunkers! I love you! [laughs] -[Dunk] All right.
What do you think you're doing?
Just working through some Jodi feelings I've kept locked inside.
What Jodi feelings?
Love and loss, bro.
You didn't lose her, though. I did.
I lost her a little bit.
No, I'm saying you can't lose someone a little bit. You lose them or you don't.
Who'd have thought the love of our lives would be the same person?
-But you-- -This is crazy.
You made out with her in an escape room for, like, six seconds. That's not love.
Then why is my heart still trapped in that escape room?
I'm not your therapist.
Listen, now that you and Jodi are broken up,
think you could put in a good word for me?
-You missed a spot. -Hey, no.
-Too late. -No.
[voice] You definitely failed that calculus test.
Maybe college isn't in the cards for you either.
-Jodi! -Mikey…
[voice] It's getting real. There's no turning back… turning back…
-You're in too deep now… too deep now… -[heartbeat]
If you're this nervous looking at a poster,
what are you gonna do on stage?
-Getting psyched for opening night? -Yeah, so psyched.
[voice] But look at Kimmy. So poised, so confident.
For God's sake, the name of the role is Kim!
Just quit and let her have it.
Jodi, breathe.
What?
You're holding your breath.
Oh. I was. [chuckles] [Tommy] Yeah.
Do you ever find it nerve-racking to watch your understudies rehearse?
Not really. No.
[chuckles] Of course not. Because you don't get nervous.
Now, why wouldn't you think I get nervous, huh?
I mean, look at you.
Wow. Okay, so you've been judged your whole life based on your appearance,
and now you're doing the same thing to me?
Yeah, I did just do the same thing.
-It's okay. -Sorry.
One of the reasons why I can remember every word of your homecoming speech
is because of how much I related to it.
In what way?
I'll show you.
-So this is where it happened. -Where what happened?
That was impressive! [laughs]
Thank you.
This is the place where I got my nickname
that lasted all the way throughout middle school.
Tommy-potamus. Yeah.
You… You were overweight?
Oh, yeah. Way over.
How far over?
Far enough to where I'd be going down that slide, and kids would just yell,
"Tommy-potamus is on the slide!" -"Earthquake! Take cover!" -Oh!
-Creative. -Isn't it? -Mm. Yeah. [giggles] -Yeah.
I don't know, I just-- I started exercising and eating right and got the weight off eventually.
and got the weight off eventually. But I still felt the same way inside.
For me, it's movie theaters.
I've had so much stuff thrown at my head because I'm blocking the screen.
-[laughs] I see. -I can't totally relax in movie theaters.
I think I'm just sitting there waiting to get pelted by popcorn.
Well, hey. If we ever do go to the movies,
I am more than happy to sit in the back row with you, so…
Well, you will be miserable, so I will buy the popcorn.
I could never be miserable hanging out with you.
[laughs] It's-- It's funny, um…
I've… I've never thought of guys dealing with the same weight issues that girls do.
Yeah, those experiences just get hardwired into our brains.
Totally shapes who we are and how we think.
Do you think it's possible for us to…
I don't know, rewire our brains
so that we don't get those negative thoughts?
I don't know. Let's give it a shot.
May I have this dance, Kim?
What? You-- You want to rehearse here?
Look, Jodi, this place has been just one big, bad memory for me.
Maybe you can help me turn it into a good one.
-[music plays] -All right. -Guess so. -Yeah.
-Okay. -[both laugh]
[Fareeda] What?
I knew Conrad liked you.
Okay, Tommy. Whoever. I have so many questions.
Whoever. I have so many questions.
Question one. Do you want it to happen again?
I don't know.
Question two. Does that mean you want to get back together with Dunk?
I don't know. I mean, maybe Dunk's the one I'm supposed to be with.
-[groans] Okay, why do I feel so guilty? -Because you and Dunk just broke up.
But make no mistake, you are free to kiss whoever you want.
-I know. -But so is Dunk.
I know. I just… I would like to believe that if he did,
he would have enough respect to tell me so I wouldn't hear it from somebody else.
-[Fareeda] Then you know what to do. -Yeah, I do.
-Boom. -Oh, snap.
-Here it is. Ready? Five, six. -♪ But it's our song, so here we go ♪
♪ I don't care who you are… ♪
-[laughs] ♪ Where you're from ♪
♪ What you did ♪
♪ As long as you love me ♪
We're never gonna break up.
[Jodi] Never.
-[Dunk] We're perfect. -[Jodi] Mwah!
Whatcha doin'?
Hey! Don't you ever knock?
You've been in here for over an hour. I was worried.
-[Dunk] I'm fine. -You're not fine.
You're watching videos of you and Jodi again?
Yeah, I can hear through the door.
I'm deleting them, okay?
[Stig] How many have you deleted so far?
None. But I was about to before you barged in and interrupted me.
-Okay. Stella, come quick! -Don't--
-She won't want to miss this. -[Dunk] Don't bring her into this.
What's up?
Dunkleman was just about to delete all the videos of him and Jodi.
Yeah.
-[Stella] Really? -Yeah.
-[Stella] Bold. -Yeah.
But smart. Erase any memory of the relationship.
-Beignet? -Always.
Oh, everyone knows when you eat these, you don't inhale.
Look, I know you guys don't believe me. -[coughing] -[Dunk] But check this out.
Eighty-seven videos checked, and…
they're deleted. They're gone. What are you doing?
The videos aren't truly deleted until you click "Delete permanently."
Yeah. Good save.
We definitely want to make sure that these cherished memories
that meant so much to you are gone forever,
never to be seen or experienced again.
Yeah.
Like they never even happened, Dunk.
Yeah. After I press this button, they didn't. One--
-If so, I should-- -[Stig] And a half.
-Two. -[Dunk] Let me--
-[Stig] Two and a half. -Three! Fine! Uh-- You win!
I'm not okay!
I'm lost without her.
And I-- I want her back. Is that what you want to hear?
No, but I know someone else who might.
The, uh, mangoes are really fresh today, so… [chuckles]
Oh, uh… peace offering?
Tradition.
So if we're, um, keeping with the traditions,
uh, are we still performing "As Long as You Love Me"
at Fareeda's birthday party?
It's gonna be the highlight of the night.
Cool.
-[chuckles] -I just can't even believe it.
They discounted your shirts by 20%?
Which is embarrassing enough.
But to make it even worse, I took my parents to the store,
thinking they'd be impressed.
And they saw with their own eyes that their daughter,
who'd been talking up her big future as a designer,
had been marked down.
So, um, I-- I just want to say how sorry I am for leaving our dinner.
No, I'm sorry for overreacting.
[laughs] Yeah.
Are we cool?
Yeah, we're-- we're cool.
I choked at my Bye Bye Birdie audition.
That was one time.
It happens every time.
-Honestly, I've never even been in a show. -What?
When I met Jodi, I acted like I had been in Cats,
'cause I wanted to impress her. -Duh. -[chuckles]
If I'm goofing around at the piano, yeah, I can hold a tune.
But the second I have to do it in front of other people…
Zhoop! I freeze.
Did you really think telling Jodi you were in Cats would impress her?
Or anyone?
If you are not moved by singing cats,
you have no soul.
Well, good thing I'm a cat person.
Oh. Well, I'm a dog person, so I guess this is never going to work.
You know, there's something I need to tell you.
Really? 'Cause… 'Cause, you know, actually, so do I. Yeah.
-Oh, go first. -No, no, no, please, go ahead.
-[laughs] -Great. Okay. Um… [laughs nervously] Okay, um…
Whew. Okay, I'm just gonna-- I'm just gonna say it.
I kissed someone.
And I wanted you to hear it from me, because I really care about you.
That's something that's never gonna change.
I just… Dunkleman, wait. No, no, no, no, I… [sighs]
-Come on, dude. Help me out. -This is crazy. Relax.
Just hold the bag for me.
I just want everything that reminds me of her gone.
-Pictures, memories. Like this. -No.
Yeah. The Backstreet Boys.
It's gotta go. I can't do it!
What else? Come on. Get--
-Our future dogs! -No!
-They were. They're gone now! -No! Penelope and Fifi!
No Dalmatians for Dunkers. Cat. All the cute animals. Especially the giraffe!
Wait, wait, wait. Why the giraffe?
Because tall!
-That's actually good sense. -Yes, I know.
[Dunk] Please leave a message.
Come on, Dunk. Can't we talk this out?
[Dunk] Her favorite book. [laughs] Yeah, I read this for her.
Hey, just calling to place my smoothie order for tomorrow.
[Dunk] Never making a smoothie again. That can go.
Too soon? Yeah. Too soon.
Why are there so many photos? I didn't even look good in this one.
I'm gonna keep this for myself.
This isn't fair. We were broken up.
The camera she got me for my 15th birthday.
This? This has gotta go. Catch.
Gone.
I think you'll regret throwing all this out.
I'm up to my ears in regret, so what's one more?
-Hey! Oh! Oh no! -[weeping] -Oh no. What's happened? -[sniffles]
Ingvar has been cheating on me with Ebba Oloffson!
What? How do you know?
Gunborg Bjork saw them kissing last night at the Jokkmokk Festival!
I just called Ingvar, and I said, "I'm done with you!"
-Good! -And relationships. Forever!
Yes! Yes! You know, when I was in the second grade,
I wrote Jodi a note that said, "Will you go out with me? Yes or no?"
And she wrote in "Maybe."
Our relationship was doomed from the start.
-We don't need them. -No, we don't.
-Delete permanently. -Yeah.
-Delete permanently. -Yeah!
-Delete permanently! -Nice!
I just had a great idea, Stella.
-You and I should form an alliance. -An alliance?
Let's say they want to get back together with us.
We can remind each other of this exact moment,
and prevent each other from ever feeling this kind of pain again!
-I'm in! -Great!
[gasps] What about you?
I am not going to be a part of your stupid alliance.
Look, I've spent my entire life just waiting around for her.
I have the bag of stuff to prove it.
Look at all this stuff. I've got… pictures in here. I've got mementos.
The camera she bought me when I was 15.
You know what? Maybe Jodi wasn't supposed to be my destiny.
Maybe this was the path I was supposed to go down. Photography.
Check it out. Who wants to be my first subject? Let's shoot.
Forming the alliance is only phase one. All right? Phase two…
Forming the alliance is only phase one. All right? Phase two… Phase two is where we show our exes that we don't need them.
-That we're living our best lives. -We don't need relationships to be happy.
Thank you, yes. That we're not…
dying inside.
I don't miss Ingvar at all.
Oh, right, yeah. Okay. How are you doing that? Got this leg up here.
Okay. Oh, this is a little tougher than I…
Taking the picture. Here we go.
You hate yoga. You have a weak core.
Well, those things are just dangerous. [scoffs]
Oh! The puppies! [gasps]
Oh my God, they're so… No!
Balloon animals? Are you five now?
Come on. It's not even Halloween.
Why is she braiding his hair?
Okay, back to the puppies. I'm just going to crop them out.
They're cute.
-Hey, Harper, I really need to-- -Ah-buh-buh-buh-buh…
Chess teaches focus, creative thinking, and how to be quick on your feet.
All of which are going to sharpen my interview skills.
Checkmate! Hah! Wow, I did not see that coming.
[Jodi] Dunkleman broke up with me.
I kissed somebody else and told him. Now he's not responding to me.
It looks like he's living his best life!
And he even threw a puppy party! I mean--
Why is this the first I'm hearing about this?
You're leaving soon,
so I'm trying to wean myself off asking for advice when I have a problem.
I'm still here. Wean on me.
Okay, what do I do?
When Diego and I broke up, and I kissed Alexander--
Harper, this is not about you.
Right, I always forget that.
Okay. If he's not returning texts or calls,
you need to knock on his door and force him to talk things out.
What do I say?
You're an actress now. Let's improv.
It'll be good practice for both of us. I'll be Dunkleman.
Okay? And you be you.
-Ready? -Okay… Okay.
And action.
Okay, uh, Dunkleman, look, I know that you're probably really, really upset with me--
Of course I'm upset.
You kissed someone else mere moments after we broke up.
Did the last three months mean nothing to you?
Was our entire relationship just some big joke?
-What? -I make you smoothies every day, Jodi!
-I know. No. -I stood on crates! You're a monster!
I know. I know. I'm-- I'm the worst. I'm so sorry.
-I-- -Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm just preparing you for the worst-case scenario.
Oh. Okay, so he's, like-- He's not going to say, like, any of that.
-No. [laughs] -[chuckles]
[sighs] Okay, okay. Good.
-Well, he might. -[knocking]
[Jodi] Stella?
Hi.
Is Dunkleman home?
Hello, Jodi.
[Jodi] Hi. Hi. [chuckles]
Wow, uh… [chuckles] I missed the memo, I guess.
Oh, the flannels?
We're trying to start a trend. Thanks for noticing.
Sorry, but I don't need this anymore.
It was a gift.
It just doesn't feel right to keep it.
Good day.
Hello.
Hi.
So, uh, about the other night.
-Yeah, look. -Yeah. I had the best time.
But you didn't say anything to me afterwards. Or since, really, so…
-Yeah, I… [sighs] -[sighs]
My boyfriend and I had just broken up, and I mean just,
so I don't think I was expecting… that to happen so soon afterwards.
We-- We don't have to rush into anything, okay?
I just-- I just wanna get to know you better.
Okay.
So, you, uh, going to the burning ceremony Saturday night?
I heard something about that. [laughs] What is it exactly?
Well, it's before tech week starts.
Some of the cast, they get together at, uh, Crescent Park.
Everyone brings a little something to throw in, you know.
Anything to help clear their minds,
get rid of any negative energy before opening night.
That sounds--
-Cheesy. I know, it is so cheesy. -[laughs] But it's gonna be great.
Yeah. I, um… I actually have a birthday party Saturday night.
Maybe you can come to the bonfire first and hit up the party afterwards?
I really don't know how much fun I'll be right now.
You're the lead. You should go.
It'll be fun.
Okay, I'll go.
-I'll see you Saturday. -I will see you Saturday.
-[Tommy] Actually-- -[Jodi] Yeah, I'm chemistry…
-[Tommy] Art. -]Jodi] Ah.
So, my dad lives in Arizona, and he has never seen me in a show.
Every year, he says he'll try to make it out for one, and I believe him,
but he never comes, just sends a postcard.
This is the year I stop believing.
Very nice.
Thank you.
All right, um… So, growing up,
I had such messed-up body issues
that I'd wear these oversized T-shirts so kids wouldn't make fun of me at school.
And of course, this did not help the matter.
Hey, hey, look, they were cool back in the day, just not on me, and it's all right.
Anyway, look, I don't know if anyone is truly 100% comfortable in their own skin,
but, one day, I hope to be.
Told you it was cheesy.
It was actually really cool.
Thank you.
Yeah.
[chuckling] Okay, I'll go. Um…
My boyfriend and I just broke up.
And, uh, he was my first boyfriend,
which I've heard is the hardest one to get over.
Anyways, uh, he…
He gave me these.
It's probably one of the sweetest things anyone has ever done for me.
But as long as these exist,
I don't think I'll be able to move on.
And I want to move on.
I need to move on.
So, um, this is the first step.
Okay.
-Wait, no, no, no, no. -Hey! -No! I don't want to move on. -That's not safe.
-I think it's too late. -I got it!
Jodi says she'll be here soon. She's finishing up a cast thing.
Of course she is.
So did you tell your parents the good news yet?
So did you tell your parents the good news yet? [Fareeda] Not yet.
Fareeda's shirts sold out!
No way!
-[laughs] -Well, that's wonderful, dear!
-You should be proud of yourself. -Yeah.
I am. Are you?
-Of course we are. -Yes.
But you turned 17 today, and it's time to get serious about your future.
And it's not that we don't think that you're talented, because we do.
But the odds of succeeding in the fashion industry are next to impossible, sweetheart.
-Medical school is a safer career path. -Exactly. Yes.
With all due respect, one of the many things I've admired about your daughter
is that she forges her own path.
I can't wait to see what's waiting for her at the end of it.
-Can I get you anything else? -No.
-But you can put him on a separate check. -Honey.
-I'm kidding. -[all laugh] I'm kidding.
-[murmurs] I am not kidding. -Hm? -I am watching that boy. -Oh my…
So, uh, it turns out I am not ready to move on.
Yeah.
Appears that way.
I'm so sorry.
For what?
I feel like I led you on with that kiss.
You didn't lead me on.
As much as it pains me to say this,
I don't think you should give up on your ex.
Because if you do,
this pair of crispy, ankle-strap platforms will be the only memory of your time together.
You really know your shoes.
I grew up with three sisters.
Friends?
Friends.
[Schnipper] Kimmy!
Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Hey!
-Dude, that was so cool! -What?
You saved Jodi's shoes.
They were designer. It'd be a sin to let 'em burn.
-You are evolving. -You take that back.
Like a tiny caterpillar into a beautiful chrysalis.
A chrysalis is the transition state between caterpillar and butterfly.
-I know what it is. -I knew you had a good heart.
-You know nothing. -Sure, Kimmy.
[chuckles] Whatever you say.
Nothing!
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪
Yeah! Make a wish.
-[dad] Yeah! -Whoo! [Dunk] There we go!
[emcee] Next up on stage, please welcome Fareeda and Stig.
-What did you do? -I signed us up for a song.
-No. No. Come on, no. -Yeah. -No, no, no, no. -Yeah.
-Come on! Come on. -No. -Come on! -[Stella] Just go!
Fareeda, why would you think this is a good idea?
The only way to conquer your fear of singing in front of people is to just do it.
He's a little shy. Give him a hand, people.
-No. No. -[cheering]
Just a little something to remind you of home.

-Can I put these in your trunk? -Sure.
No, wait!
Those are my shirts.
Yeah.
You bought them all?
You were losing confidence in yourself. I--
I thought this might help give some of it back.
That is so…
unbelievably stupid.
Why was it stupid?
Because nothing's changed. I still failed.
But if you want something bad enough, you go for it until you get it.
You don't take no for an answer. Just like I did with you and Dunkers.
You wanted nothing to do with me, and now look. We're all friends again.
If I had given up, I… Well, I wouldn't even be here right now.
Well, I'm really glad you are here.
Yeah, me too.
-Happy birthday. -[chuckles]
That was very bad.
Oh no. Oh, I ate a lot of garlic, Fareeda, I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry. Let me get a mint, and then we'll try it again?
Well, no, not the kiss. I just broke girl code.
You did?
I can't kiss a guy my best friend used to like.
Sorry, I'm not up to date on the codes.
Now she shows up?
-Act cool. Act cool. -Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sorry. Oh my God, I am so, so sorry that I'm late. I--
-Happy birthday. -[chuckles]
-Don't sweat it. -Seriously?
I just missed your birthday dinner. You're not mad?
No. I mean, it's not cool to miss your best friend's birthday,
but things happen. And I'm a very forgiving person.
We should all be more forgiving.
Because like I said, things happen. [giggles]
Yeah.
They do.
Yeah.
Where's Dunk?
-I wanna talk to him. -Inside.
-Okay. Happy birthday. -[chuckling] Thanks.

[dad] Wait, so Juilliard has a summer theater program?
[mom] Yes. If she wants to apply there for college, getting in the summer program will give her a leg up on the competition.
[voice] They won't be talking about Juilliard after they see you in the show.
I think we should hire a professional videographer for the show.
-Yes! I'm seeing three-camera set up. -Yep.
[dad] Oh, at least.
-Right? -Have you two lost your minds? -Hey! -What?
It's never too early to start thinking--
No, this is the last thing I need to think about right now.
Is something wrong?
I've been spending all my time on the show, so I'm failing calculus.
I just lost Dunkleman.
Then I burned the shoes that he gave me, and I'm going to be horrible in the show,
and you guys just keep inviting people that are just gonna sit and watch me fail.
And Harper, she's moving 2,000 miles away,
and there is no way in hell that Juilliard, or anyone, for that matter,
is gonna want anything to do with me, so I just…
Are you okay?
Mom, I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
[mom] Pull over. Richie, pull over.
-You're okay. -I can't breathe.
-You're okay. Just relax. -I'm not. Slow deep breaths. In.
-Out. -I can't.
You're not in any danger.
-Just tell yourself, "This is temporary." -This is temporary.
-"It's not forever." -It's not forever. -"This will end." -This will end. [gasps]
Here.
[Richie] There you go.
How did you know what to say?
[Richie] Your mom has been backstage
at, like, a thousand beauty pageants.
So I tried to learn some tips in case it ever happened to Harper.
I'm so sorry that I'm the screwed-up daughter.
-I don't… -Oh, stop that! You're perfect as you are.
Aah, anxiety attacks are really common.
-Especially with parents like us. -Dad.
We have put way too much pressure on you with the invites and the Juilliard.
We should have seen it coming.
So, could you, um… Could you guys give me some tips,
you know, just in case it ever happens again? [chuckles]
Yeah. We can do that.
I mean, you two did screw me up. The least you could do is try to fix me.
-Oh, too soon. -[laughs] Yeah, not funny yet.
Okay, now it's funny. -Okay. -[all laugh]
[Jodi] Wow, uh…
Packing already?
I just thought I'd get a head start on it.
So…
I've been sitting here all night
staring at these boxes.
And I can't bring myself to tape them up.
Because ever since I was eight years old, no matter what I did,
you were there.
You guys are my support system.
-And now I won't have that anymore. -No.
Just because we're not in the audience doesn't mean that we're not there for you.
But what if I tank this job?
Or what if I get fired?
What if beauty pageants are the only thing I'm actually good at?
Harper, since when do you…
get that voice?
Since always.
-Surprise! [laughs] -What?
[laughs] What about the,
"If you don't learn to control it, it's gonna control you"?
Yeah, I don't know how to control it. I just wanted to sound like I did.
You don't always have to have the right answer for everything.
Well, I do if I want people to take me seriously.
And not just see me as some ex-beauty queen.
You want people to take you seriously?
Then know that you don't have to be afraid to say, "I don't know,"
if you don't know.
I'll tell you one thing I definitely don't know.
How I'm gonna survive without you.
Me neither.
-So how am I gonna do this? -[both laugh and sniffle]
Pack, or… or leave us?
Both. Both.
One box at a time.
-Whoa. -Ready? That was a good one.
-Hefty! -You ready for these arms?
Hey, man, you can't sleep either?
Not a wink.
What's your excuse?
Well, I kissed someone.
-Was it Jodi? Tell me it wasn't. -No, it wasn't. I swear.
Who was it?
It was Fareeda.
-What? Fareeda? -Yeah.
That's awesome, right?
Except she says it can't go anywhere because of girl code. -Aww. -[sighs] Ugh.
If-- If that's what she wants, then you have to respect that.
[groans] I should've joined your stupid alliance when I had the chance.
Don't say that. Isn't it better to have loved and lost
than to have never loved at all?
I wouldn't take back the three months I spent with Jodi for anything.
The dinner party? The turducken? You ruined three birds, Dunkers.
Damn, man. I wouldn't take it back.
You know, in a weird way,
it never would have happened if you didn't show up,
so I kind of owe it to you.
Glad to be of service, Dunk. That's what friends do.
I know you're supposed to leave when the semester ends.
Yeah.
But if… Ugh. I mean, if you wanted to,
you should stay here for the summer.
-Here? Me? -Yes. -Yes. -Dunk?
-Yes. -Me and Dunk? Stig and Dunk?
-Yes! Whoo-hoo-hoo! -Oh God, all right.
Dude! It's going to be the best summer ever!
♪ Supersonic, tonight I want it ♪ ♪ So keep it comin' ♪ ♪ Whoo-hoo-ooh-ooh ♪ ♪ Supersonic ♪
[Jodi] Wait, you bought all of them?
[Stig laughs] Yeah, she's cool with it now, but when she saw it, she flipped out.
-I didn't flip out. -Oh, you did too.
Shut up. [laughing]
Hey, Fareeda.
I know.
Know what?
I know.
I actually knew the other night in the parking lot.
And it's okay.
Are you sure?
Trust me, it is the only thing in my life that I am sure of right now.
-Thank you. -Of course.
Did we just reverse the girl codes?
-[both laugh] -Mmkay. Okay, you two have fun.
-[Fareeda] Got that mint? -[Stig] Oh, I have that mint.
Surprised to see you here.
Just doing my part to support the arts.
Yeah.
Okay, look, I know that you don't wanna talk to me and I get it.
I do. [sighs]
But I wanna let you know
I'm gonna leave you a ticket at the box office tomorrow.
Although, who knows? Maybe I just won't show up myself.
-Wait, what? -I don't know. I just…
I've just been hearing that
maybe I'm not good enough,
or maybe I'm just not ready to do this sort of thing yet.
Well, whoever's saying that is wrong.
They don't know you like I know you.
Trust me. That's all just noise. You're gonna crush it.
Dunkers.
I need a spot.
Glad we had this talk.
[Dunk] What? What's wrong?
It's Ingvar. He face called me. He wants to get back together.
Let me talk to this guy. Let me talk to him!
Listen here, Ingvar!
Holy crap. He's gorgeous.
His face is so symmetrical.
-Keep going. -Okay.
Listen, Ingvar.
You broke Stella's heart.
Shame on you for trying to trick her into thinking you can piece it back together.
So text me the name of whatever hair product it is you're using,
and then lose her number. Yep. Bye.
Boom! That's how you spot. Come on.
What's wrong?
I still want that.
Ew. Your brother?
No, not my brother. And not Ingvar.
Isn't there a little part of you that still wants that with Jodi?
No.
Yeah, of course, obviously. Like every part of me.
But… I just-- I don't know if I can trust her again.
Your whole life, you put her on a pedestal.
The second she does something that ruins your perfect image of her,
you push her off of it.
-[murmur of conversation] -[Stig] Hey!
-That's my daughter. -[Richie laughs] -That's my kiddo. -[Harper] Mom.
-Mom, we gotta… -Okay. Sit down.
-Settle down. Okay. -Okay.
I'm good. I'm settled. I'm fine.
-Look at that. -So excited.
[voice] Wow, a packed house… packed house…
Twenty bucks says you fall flat on your face… face…
You're about to humiliate yourself in front of all the people you care about.
Sorry.
[voice] Except Dunkleman, who didn't show.
Guess he couldn't bear to watch you crash and burn.
Excuse me.
In a few short hours, you'll go back to being just the tall girl.
Okay. This is not forever. It's temporary.
Aww, look who's trying to ground herself by tidying up… tidying up…
How's that workin' out… workin' out…
Don't you get it? You will never control me.
I control you.
[Kimmy] Jodi?
-[sighs] -You okay? You're on soon.
Look, I can't… I can't go out there.
-Why not? Jodi, why not? -[sighs]
I am afraid I'm going to have an anxiety attack on stage, okay?
-You get those too? -What do you mean, "too"?
I'm a 17-year-old on planet Earth. It'd be weird if I didn't get anxiety attacks.
Okay, but you can still go on for me, right? 'Cause I can't.
No. No.
But this is what you wanted, isn't it?
-Yeah, but not like this. -Wh--
But I will stand in the wings for the entire show.
And if you get tripped up, just look over and I'll cue you.
Okay?
I've got your back. I won't let you fail.
Thank you.
Now, go get dressed.
-Go. -Yeah.
[Schnipper] That wasn't so hard, was it?
Putting someone else's needs before your own?
I literally almost puked.
Does kindness always burn?
Only when you're doing it right.
Come here, girl.
Hey, does Jodi ever mention me at all?
-[laughs] -Let it go, dude.
Letting it go.
[voice] Break a leg, Jodi… leg, Jodi… You're gonna need all the luck you can get.
-You're gonna choke. -[Jodi thinks] It's just noise.
Breathe.

-You are still a fraud. -Hey, guys. Great job.
-[boy] Thanks. You too. -[voice] Oh!
-You think you can tune me out? -[Jodi thinks] I was good tonight.
[voice] Hey, I'm talking to you.
[Jodi thinks] And this dream, it's… It isn't so crazy.
-[voice] Are you listening to me? -[Jodi thinks] I can do this. [voice fading] Hello? Hello?
[Jodi thinks] I'm good enough to do this.
Hello, Jodi.
You came.
Yeah, of course I did.
Well, I saved you a seat.
Yeah, I was just up in the lighting booth. It has a better angle for pictures.
Oh.
You were amazing.
Thank you.
Can I see the pictures?
Sure.
[Jodi] Wow.
Can I…
These are beautiful.
It's the camera.
I think it's the person behind it.
I think it's the person in front of it.
I don't know why it took you so long to use this. You're…
really good.
Thanks, but the only reason I ever told you I was into photography
is 'cause I thought it sounded cool.
I mean, this-- this could be your thing.
Yeah. Maybe.
I don't know.
I don't think I wanna force picking my thing,
just 'cause it feels like everyone has theirs figured out.
I get that.
Look, I don't know what I want to do with my life.
But I know that I want you in it.
I love you, Jodi.
And you-- And you're not saying it back, which is… [laughs]
And you-- And you're not saying it back, which is… [laughs] …cool. It's fine.
'Cause it-- Uh-- Ahh, you know, it's funny… It's fine. It's fine.
[laughing] I had this voice in my head saying I shouldn't say it,
because I don't wanna force you into anything.
I just wanna, like, you know, tell you how I'm feeling, and it…
It's fine if you don't feel the same way. I-- All I'm saying is, no pressure on you.
I just want to let you know how I'm feeling because--
I love you too.
-[laughs] Okay! -Oh, and, um…
-[laughs] Okay! -Oh, and, um… I kind of burned the shoes that you gave me for homecoming.
What?
-♪ Figure you out… ♪ -[boy] Jodi! You were terrific. -Thanks. -[boy] Yeah!
-[Jodi] Hey! -Oh, Jodi! I'm so proud of you.
-[Jodi] Thank you. -I may be biased, but you are a star.
-[Jodi] You're so sweet. -[giggles]
-[Jodi] Hi, guys. Thank you. -Jodi. -[Jodi] Oh, thank you! Hi. -[girl] There she is.

[Jodi] Thank you.
I did not know you could sing like that.
-You were amazing. -Thanks, Mom.
-All right, go have fun. -Okay, thank you for the party.
-Yes! -[laughs]
-Great job tonight. -Thanks.
-[girl] Hey, Jodi. -Hey, guys.
[girl] Hi.
You know, my school back in Sweden has a foreign exchange student program. Hah!
You think I'm gonna move across the world
to spend my senior year with you after one kiss?
-Come on. Take a chance on me. -♪ I could love you with my eyes closed… ♪
-You killed it, big little sister. -Thank you, little big sister.
Okay, do not leave me in suspense.
How did you control this?
Oh, I didn't.
Just for the first time, I was kind of able to…
turn down the volume.
But how?
I was good tonight.
If the voice inside my head refuses to tell me that,
then… I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna have to tell myself.
And just like that, the teacher has become the student.
That is not how that saying goes.
Agree to disagree.
-[sighs] -[Dunk] Hey.
Hey.
I almost forgot your opening night present.
That's so sweet. [chuckles] Okay. What is it?
[Jodi] How did you…
[laughs] How did you get this?
Well, the day after we broke up,
I was doing some Marie Kondo-ing around the house, and I just found it.
I love it. -[chuckles] -I love it! Wow!
But something's really off.
It's really off.
[man] I do not. Who's that?
[woman scoffs] Asshole. You do. Cut it out, man.
-[man] Barack Obama. Just hit me. -[woman] Of course.
Barack Hussein, which by the way is the coldest middle name in the game.
It's like if my middle name was Gambino Crime Family.
-It's just gangster. Come on, man. -[man laughs]
-I mean, he smoked Newports. -[woman] Newports.
[man] What else you gonna say?
The president of the United States was smoking Newports.
I'm like, this is my guy.
[woman] Bro, has to be.
He's smoking the preferred cigarette of crackheads across the globe.
[woman] That's what I love about Barack, is like, he's become such an icon.
He's kind of like Jesus.
Like, he could just be whatever version of him you want him to be.
-[man] Hmm. -[Mo] My Barack does gay stuff sometimes.
-[man laughing] -[woman] Only when on coke. You know what I'm saying?
He don't do a lot of coke, just, like, a little bit off the nail.
And just only when it's, like, special occasions.
Like a real big win.
He's like, "I'mma do coke and a little bit of gay stuff."
[man] Does your Barack do coke to excuse his gay stuff?
-[woman] Of course. -[man] Right.
Then he just has an out at the end to go, like, "I was on coke. It was fine."
-[woman] Yeah. -[man] Okay. But really he just woke up that day wanting to do some stuff.
-[woman] "Gonna do gay stuff." -[man] Yeah. -[woman laughing] "Let me get a bump." -[man chuckles] Yeah.
-[woman laughing] "Let me get a bump." -[man chuckles] Yeah.
[woman] Yo, yo, yo! Welcome to The Mo and E-Z Show.
I'm Mo, and to my left is my favorite Jew with nothing to do, my boy E-Z.
It was a better time, in general.
-2014, bro. Just a good year. -Unbelievable.
-Meek Mill was with Nicki. -Mm-hmm.
Bobby Shmurda came out and went in.
-[chuckles] -You had the Ice Bucket, uh, Challenge.
-[Mo] Yes, yes. -[E-Z] What was that, ALS?
Dude, ALS is the most paid disease of all time.
-[laughing] -ALS made more than LeBron that year.
-ALS is on the boat with Jay and Beyoncé. -[laughing] For sure.
They're like, "Let me tell you what it's like to be rich."
The BLM movement, though, is so serious right now.
It's everywhere, for sure.
This feels like they got the same people who did marketing for Cuties and kale.
-[laughing] -They're Blackening everything.
Black iCarly, Black Wonder Years,
which is set in the same time period,
and it's like, bro, I don't wanna watch Black Kevin Arnold
gets sprayed by a hose for a half an hour every friggin' Friday.
Yeah, I feel like once a Black person won a gold medal for swimming,
it was pretty much a wrap on race relations.
Yo, I saw a dude fencing in the Olympics, a Black dude, this past Olympics.
-I was like, "Man, too much." -[laughs] You're like, "Over the line."
-Over the line. Back up. -[laughing]
Like, when they took the Confederate flags out of NASCAR,
I was like, "Nah, let 'em have that."
You take too much too fast, they be out looking for meat.
-[laughing] -You know what I'm saying?
-Please be seated. -[E-Z] Oh, my God.
That was standing up for 45 minutes. -That was, like, the longest one. -[woman] Shh!
So we just finished widduy, the confession,
which we do in the plural.
-We take responsibility… -[woman 2 chuckles]
Mom, why do I have to wear this dress, and he gets to dress like he's at Summer Jam?
Ezra, where's your yarmulke?
Oh, shit. Left it in the car.
Okay. Honey, I'm not square, okay?
Nobody thinks I'm square. Everyone thinks I'm cool.
-I'm hip. -[groans]
People think I'm a very youthful person.
"I get it." You know, you're expressing yourself with these illustrations.
Graffiti all over your body. Okay, fine.
But it is Yom Kippur, goddamn it.
First of all, can you please stop saying "I get it" and using air quotes?
And second of all, when someone says, "I'm cool. I get it," they never are cool, and they never get it.
-You shouldn't have to say that. -That's not true.
You won't be able to be buried in a Jewish cemetery.
Bubby, I love you so much, respectfully,
but I'll be dead.
I don't give a shit where I'm buried, respectfully.
You can take my ashes, and you can flush them down the urinal
at Dodger Stadium, respectfully.
Oh, so now you're disrespecting the Dodgers?
I wanna be buried next to Rihanna.
-[mother] Rihanna? -[man] Yeah.
Okay, I'm gonna scrape those tattoos off myself,
and I'm gonna bury you in a double-wide coffin with me.
-Okay, how about that? -Sounds good.
Sounds good.
Thanks for that. I appreciate it.
You look like a dad who lost his kid at Coachella.
You look like the principal of a Hebrew school version of Hogwarts.
You look like a young Hulk Hogan.
I have a question. What do you and the rabbi talk about in the car
on the way to the rabbinical witch outlet store?
Is it a lot of music? Or is there heavy conversation?
-Ezra! [laughs] -[Ezra] Hey, how are ya?
-How are ya? -How old are you?
I'm… I'm 35 now.
Got a girlfriend?
No.
You say that so cavalier, like it's a bad thing.
You don't like getting pussy?
Well, hearing the word pussy come out of your mouth
does make me question whether or not I like it.
It's 2022!
Maybe the kid enjoys smoking the Hebrew Nationals.
I know you're trying to be progressive, but it's coming off crazy homophobic.
But it's… it's good to see you. And, uh, stay… stay alive.
-[man] Hey, hey, bud, bud. -Hey, Doc.
Hi, how's your penis?
Uh, I think it's… I think it's good.
-Yeah, uh, listen, uh, come with me. -I think-- Let's go to the bathroom, and, uh, we'll take a look, okay?
Let's go to the bathroom, and, uh, we'll take a look, okay?
-I'm good. -No, no, it's fine. It's fine.
Don't… don't worry. Uh, it's on the house.
There's not gonna be a charge.
-No, it's not the price that concerns me. -Oh. -It's more the concept. -I see.
-It's more the concept. -I see.
-You sure? We can go-- -[grandmother] Doctor!
My teeth are getting crooked again.
[doctor] Uh-huh. If you open your mouth real wide.
-[mother] Ezzy. -[Ezra] Uh-huh.
I want you to be chill right now.
-But Kim Glassman is over there. -Mm-hmm. And she is totally checking you out.
-Right now, okay? -Uh-huh.
And she just completed her doctorate at Harvard,
and she is crazy lit.
Right over there. You see her?
Yeah, she just-- and she saw you point at her.
-She didn't see. -[Ezra] Yeah, she 100% percent saw.
She's got it here, here, the whole nine yards.
Yeah, you like her body and her mind.
-I do. I do. -Okay.
Yeah, I think, um, my old orthodontist just did some really weird sexual shit with me just now.
just did some really weird sexual shit with me just now.
Who? Oh, Dr. Green?
-Yeah, Dr. Green. -Oh, yeah, he's in a lot of trouble.
-He's in trouble? -Yeah, he's in a lot of trouble.
-Yeah. -Okay, so that's like a thing?
[inhales] Uh, well, he hasn't been convicted.
Totally. In the four seconds I spoke with him,
he tried to pull me in the bathroom and look at my dick,
so I'm just gonna say I might support the accusers on this one.
I will say that there is a legal system, and you have to have respect for the legal system, Ezzy.
-Okay. -Yeah.
You're backing him on this one. All right, okay.
Well, you know…
Innocent until proven guilty. I believe in that. I'm sure you do too.
-Correct, and I think I'm gonna bounce. -Right? -This has been a lot for one Yom Kippur. -Honey. I love you.
-I love you. You look great. Okay. -I love my baby boy.
So, um, your mom says you work in finance?
Yes, I'm a broker.
Well, that's, like, gotta be so exciting, working with so much money all the time.
Yeah, it's not really my dream job.
Well, what is?
You're gonna laugh if I tell you.
-[laughs] -Oh, God. You're not, like, a Reiki instructor, are you?
No. No, my homie and I, we have a podcast.
[clears throat] Seriously?
Yeah, yeah.
Well, what's it about?
The culture.
What culture?
You know, the culture.
Music, fashion, sports.
I mean, you're a Jew from West LA. What do you know about the culture?
Maybe deli culture, but… [laughs]
That's a good one.
Honestly, I'm starting to think
I'm never gonna meet a woman who understands me.
Bruh, you have got to stop being so thirsty, man.
It's disgusting!
I don't think I've heard of a man ever
who wanted to be in a relationship so badly besides Drake.
And I'm talking Views Drake.
I feel like Views Drake.
I feel like I'm alone on a building in Toronto
dangling my legs off, wondering what it's like to feel companionship.
That's the space I'm in.
Well, I need you to dig deep down in that little Jewish body of yours
and pull out CLB Drake, okay?
Certified Lover Boy energy all through here.
I don't have Certified Lover Boy energy, Drake energy right now.
I just don't. I'm… I'm literally… I'm literally Take Care Drake.
I'm at an Italian restaurant by myself
with a bunch of chains, drinking Manischewitz out of a goblet
and wondering when the fuck is it my turn to feel, like, deep happiness and connection.
And if I'm being honest about our friendship,
I feel like you're being a bit Pusha T right now towards me.
And I need you to be more Future to me.
I need a collaboration instead of a diss.
Well, maybe your ass needs a bully right now, bro.
Someone to push you around.
You're not even giving me Take Care Drake.
You're giving me "Houstatlantavegas" Drake.
I'm talking crying over strippers, no beard,
big upper lip.
Get it together, dawg.
You're right, I'm…
I need to be more CLB Drake.
[Mo] You'll be all right.
Just gotta find that person, You know what I mean?
Like, you need a shorty who surfs, but also can Milly Rock.
-Can I help you with that? -[scoffs] Oh, my God. No, I'm good.
Come on, why are you acting like this? I feel like you blocked me.
Um, I didn't block you, okay? I don't do weird shit like that.
-Well, did you change your phone number? -[sighs] I did.
Yo, you don't think that's weird?
Chris, do you wanna know why we really just don't work out together?
Yeah, I'm… I'm really, really curious.
'Cause you don't know how to keep it real.
You just say whatever you think I wanna hear,
and it feels fake.
And I don't really feel seen by you in any way.
[scoffs] All I do is see you, girl.
I'm always on your social media. I'm staring at you right now.
You know what? It's like James Baldwin said.
"The most dangerous creation of any society
is the man who has nothing to lose."
I don't have shit to lose 'cause I already lost you.
[sighs] All right, gimme your phone.
Girl, you had me out here sweating.
It's so crazy because my dad loves James Baldwin,
and that is, like, one of his favorite quotes.
And here's a text message from my dad to you,
telling you to tell me the same shit.
Your father and I are in a book club together.
-I don't-- -[woman] Peace.
-Bye, Chris. -It's an information exchange.
-[woman] Stay away from my house. -We put each other onto different authors.
-Ra-Ra. -[woman] Stop calling me that!
-[Chris] Ra-- -[woman] It's so weird.
[man] My mom just bought some last night.
[laughs] Here he is. Biggest swinging dick in the West!
[Ezra] There he is.
Got his-- You have a big swinging penis yourself there, my man.
The boss man.
You made that exchange weird, Ezra.
Goddamn it, all right. What's done is done, right?
I'm… I'm not good with greetings, so…
Just throw back a "hey."
-Hey. -Grease the wheel and say, "Hey."
-Swing it up. -[boss] "Hey, boss."
-Hey, boss. -"Champ. Killer."
"Dude." Not dude.
Big dick boss.
Or whatever you wanna say.
"Here he is, biggest swinging dick in the West."
There we go. You have a big penis.
-Fuck, dude, I'm sorry. -I'm not even looking for a shake.
You're belaboring a greeting.
Right.
What if I said "great fucking weather" to you, what would you say?
The weather's great for you too.
You would say that?
I don't know, I--
Forget it. Just… Just pick up the phone, come on.
-I understand. Got it. -We're burning time. Come on.
-Pick it up. -Let's go. Let's sell some stuff.
You're the man.
-[boss] Giddyup. -Let's go, baby.
Money, money, money, baby.
-[GPS] Make a complete U-turn. -[tires screech] Then a sharp left turn, then another U-turn.
Then a sharp left turn, then another U-turn.
What? [scoffs]
[GPS] Make a complete U-turn, then a sharp left turn.
-Then another U-turn. -What the fuck!
-[GPS] Make a complete U-turn, then-- -[screaming]
-What the fuck! What are you doing? -Get the fuck out!
-Get out! Help! I'm being attacked! -What?
-You're attacking me! Stop! Stop! -Get out!
-Please, relax! Fine, okay! -[whimpers]
But you're not getting five stars. This is fucked up.
Fuck you. I'm not no Uber driver.
You're not?
No, I'm not. I'm on my way to work, weirdo.
-[GPS] Make a complete U-turn… -[sighs] Oh, shit.
-[GPS] Make a complete U-turn… -[sighs] Oh, shit. I am so sorry.
No, you're not.
You saw a Black woman in an inexpensive car
and thought it was your God-given white right
to get in my backseat and tell me where to go.
It's a tale as old as time with your racist ass. Get out!
I know this seems like a racism.
-[scoffs] -But it's not.
My… My Uber driver is a Black woman who drives a Mini Cooper.
Her name is Hyacinth Ajanlekoko… -Oh, wow. -Butatembe.
-So… -Okay.
So I guess Hyacinth-whatever looks like me since we all look alike.
I mean, honestly, fucking you guys are twins.
[woman] Oh, my God, wait. She really does look like me.
Yeah, this is like a 23 and Me situation.
Like, I wanna introduce you guys.
-Okay… -You're better looking for sure.
Sir, can you get out of my car, please? Thank you.
Look, look, look. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[chuckles] This was insane.
Let me make it up to you. I know my way around Century City.
Let me get you where you're going. Who said I was lost?
[GPS] Make a complete U-turn, then a sharp left turn,
then another U-turn.
-Look, okay, but can you hurry up? -[chuckles]
Because I really cannot be late to work, for real.
[Ezra] Of course.
-Just make a right at the light. -Okay.
This ain't no Driving Miss Daisy shit, okay?
-Okay. -[woman] Don't kill me.
[Ezra] I'm not gonna kill you. Please don't kill me.
-[woman] I'm not. -[Ezra] You're the one who beat me.
[woman] I don't know you. Shit.
[Ezra] My name is Ezra. What is your name?

Look. Look at everybody's hair.
Everybody in the place is all wavy.
Except for this nigga.
I actually have the nappiest hair in this place.
-[Amira clicks tongue] -And I wear it proudly.
-[chuckling] -How am I the darkest person in the room?
There's not one tar-black nigga in this whole room.
And I mean, back in the day,
that was what you saw the most when you went in a room.
It was, you know, niggas everywhere. Now you got…
Eventually everybody gonna be looking like Bruno Mars.
A lot sooner than you think.
What that mean?
Gonna tell him about your date, Amira?
-Shut up, Omar. -[Omar] Oh, okay.

Oh, no, Daddy, not Chris.

Um, yes. He's African.

Is he Sunni or Nation?
S-Sunni.
Watch out for those brothers. Yeah, they like Lakers fans.
Don't know shit about basketball, but love to be all up at Staples,

Isn't the Nation more like Laker fans,
'cause they're the ones who just discovered the religion?
Shut up, stupid.
What you drinking?
A tropical banana whip with bee pollen. It's good.
Bee pollen? Why you need bee pollen?
Bee pollen? What, they ain't have no butterfly dust?
You know, I'm starting to hate the world more and more each day.
You know, this place used to be our thing.
Then white folks figured out
that not only did Magic Johnson and Dr. Sebi figure out how to cure AIDS,
but we also have delicious patties and smoothies.
Yeah, but, like, shouldn't we be happy that they're patronizing our business?
But at what cost, Amira?
Uh, financial freedom, cultural empowerment, market expansion.
You know what? Somebody gonna bust your teeth out one day.
You just make sure you pray with this guy.
That's how I met your mother.
We prayed together, and we knew we was meant for each other.
-[Amira] Mm-mm. -Didn't you meet Mom at Pep Boys?
Trying to return a half used bottle of Fix-a-Flat?
No, I met your mother, and we fell in love through our mutual love of God and prayer.
and we fell in love through our mutual love of God and prayer.
-[Amira] Hmm. -[father] I'm always telling y'all.
If you get your beliefs in line, your heart's gonna follow.
So I just imagined the Pep Boys thing?
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
[chuckles] Hold up. You're dating a "Black girl" Black girl?
I mean, I wouldn't put it that way.
Yo, shut-- Bro, you bagged a real one?
This is crazy.
Wait a minute though. This is way out of your league.
If this girl is what you say she is,
then I'm pretty sure she smells like cocoa butter and expectations, bro.
-You may wanna slow down. -What do you mean?
[Mo scoffs] I'm just saying, I hope no one ends up dead.
Dead?
[scoffs] Yeah, dawg.
In this social climate,
with this much racial intensity going on in this country now,
you chose to pull a move like that?
Bold, bro. Real bold.
I'm not pulling anything.
This isn't 'cause it's, like, a hot new thing. I'm not talking about a tie-dye sweatsuit. I'm talking about a person.
I'm not talking about a tie-dye sweatsuit. I'm talking about a person.
A woman who I met, who I found interesting,
who's different than the other women that I know, so I asked her out. Who cares?
Yo, please tell me you didn't buy a tie-dye sweatsuit.
Thank you.
You look great.
Oh, thank you.
I like your fit.
Thank you. You don't look so bad yourself.
Are those Gucci slides?
Yeah. Why? Are you trying to clown?
No, I'm not trying to clown. No, not at all. I think they're awesome.
And I actually think they're the perfect shoe for a first date.
Oh, this is date?
Yeah. I mean, we're two adults,
at least one of us is interested in getting to know the other one,
meeting at a specific place at a designated time,
and I'm pretty sure if I asked Siri, "Siri, what is a date?"
That would be the exact bar she would spit back at me.
Bar? Okay. [chuckles] All right, Ezra.
-Trying to cap me up. Brave. -[chuckles]
And I would never talk shit on your slides.
If you like something, you like it.
I don't think anybody should be put in a box ever.
That's real. I agree with you.
Oh, my God, it looks like a fort.
[Ezra] It's cute. You know what we're doing? We're being cute!
-[Amira laughs] We're being cute! Oh, God! -Yeah. [laughs]
-[Amira] You're crazy. -It's like a little tent.
[Amira] I've never done this before.
You've just never dated such a creative blanket architect before.
Never. I've never dated anybody so cute.
[Ezra] Yes, come on, isn't it fun?
It's like we're in our own little world.
It does feel like we are in our own little world.
Play some music. We need, like, a vibe.
-[Ezra] Yeah? -Mm-hmm.
Yeah. Any requests?
No, I trust you.
How about this?
Oh, I love this song.
You do?
So look.
I just don't be having sex with just anyone,
so, whether you like it or not,
we kind of go together now.
Yeah, that's crazy. I was gonna say a similar kind of thing.
Maybe a little less junior high, a little more mature, but, uh…
Yeah. You're my boo, come on.
You already know.
-You're obsessed with me. -No!
I'm obsessed with you?
-Yeah. -Okay.
I see you leaving stuff around here.
Judaism swagger.
It's such a turn-on.
-I just want a bagel and lox right now. -[laughing]
I love you so much!
So much!
-I can't even restrain you! -[laughing]
Shut up.
♪ Oh, you're the best part ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! You're the best part ♪
I think I'm a little nervous.
No, don't be nervous. I'm nervous.
Why are you nervous?
'Cause my family's crazy.
Everybody's family's crazy.
-No. They're nuts. -[doorbell rings]
-[laughing] Hello! Oh! -[Ezra] Hey, Mom. How are you?
-[laughs] -Hi.
-Mom, this is Amira. -[gasps] Amira, this is my mom Shelley.
Hi, Miss Shelley. -It's so nice to meet you. -Oh. Miss Shelley.
-It's so nice to meet you. -Oh. Miss Shelley.
Oh, my mom would kill me if I didn't address you in that way.
Oh, absolutely. Whatever makes you comfortable is fine with me.
Oh, my gosh, you are so beautiful.
I love your hair. I love your fingernails.
Look at these rings!
-I love them. [chuckles] -Thank you.
-Thank you. -[gasps] Look at that, your name.
What about her earlobes and the bottom of her feet?
-Oh, shut up. He loves to give me shit. -[Amira laughs]
But I think your earlobes are good too. -[laughs] I do. Come in. Come in. Come in. -[laughs]
-[laughs] I do. Come in. Come in. Come in. -[laughs] -[Shelley] Isn't this fun? -Yeah, good stuff.
Honey, honey, come and meet Amira.
I hope I'm saying that right. Amira.
-Yeah. Amira. It's just Amira. -Amira. Arnold.
Come in, come in, come in and sit.
-Uh, Amira. Yes! -[Amira] Yeah.
[Shelley] We've got cheese and crackers, but if you need something else,
I can have Lupita run to Whole Foods. Don't worry.
She's going anyway because she's picking up my dry cleaning from Browns.
She's, uh, she's from Guatemala.
[splutters] She, uh, Lupita.
Uh, but, you know, we're like sisters, actually.
She's literally like family.
I mean, it's not even like work for her, really.
I'm pretty sure it's like work for her.
I don't think Lupita's coming all the way down here just, uh, pro bono,
no money exchange, you know.
-[laughs] Oh, come on. -[Ezra] I know. I'm just saying.
-[Shelley] No, no, I get it, yeah, but-- -Yeah.
Thank you, but that's not necessary. -This looks nice. -[mouths]
-Thank you. [chuckles] -[Shelley] Oh, fabulous.
So, I understand you're a stylist.
Yeah, kind of, I'm, um-- I'm a costume designer. -But that's kind of like styling. -[both] Oh.
-Okay. -And she has the best style.
[laughing] Yes.
[Shelley] No, that I can tell, yes.
Yeah, I actually do, uh, a little styling myself.
-[Amira] Really? -[Shelley] Yeah.
Oh, Ezra never said anything to me about that.
I know, 'cause it's 100% not true. It's the first time hearing of it, so…
No, no. No, no. I mean, on me and Dad-- or on Arnold.
-And a few of our friends, yeah. -Okay.
Yeah, I… I audit their closets.
Oh, um, how do you do that?
Oh, uh, like, curate their clothes--
Prune.
[Shelley] Exactly. Yeah, and also give away things to shelters.
I'm just known as someone with good taste.
And, I mean, I'm not trying to brag. That sounds so braggy.
So, um, Amira, where are you from?
-[Amira] Here. -Oh. Well, Baldwin Hills via Inglewood.
Okay. Baldwin Hills.
Oh, that's something, yeah.
I understand that Mike…
uh, Magic Johnson has done a lot of wonderful things.
[Arnold] Magic. What a ballplayer.
Boyish enthusiasm he played with.
-Oh, yeah. -The smile!
-[Shelley] Yeah, he has a marvelous smile. -[Arnold] Yeah.
[Shelley] Yeah. I saw him once at Gelson's. -He's really tall. -[exhales]
Actually, we had an opportunity to buy there about--
-It was 15 years ago, but… [scoffs] -[groans] Oh, yeah.
-It was 15 years ago, but… [scoffs] -[groans] Oh, yeah. -…Arnold wouldn't go for it. -[imitates gunshot]
Yeah, it's a shame you missed out on that first wave of early gentrification.
You could've screwed a lot of people out of their property value.
[chuckles] Okay, so this is our lovely and very opinionated daughter Liza.
Come and meet your brother's new girlfriend.
Hi.
Hi. [chuckles]
I mean,
hey.
Okay.
[scoffs] Pull over.
-She's spoken for. [chuckles] -[Amira chuckles]
Um, Liza's gay. She's queer. She's lesbian.
-L-G-B-T-Q. -[Shelley] You got it all.
-Which we love and accept. -[Arnold] Yes. "Because that is our vibe."
"That's how we roll." [laughs]
I think she understands. Is she doing the air quote thing again?
Yeah, she's just warming up.
Oh, I… I really like your glasses. Those are cool.
Oh, thanks. I actually made them out of recycled cans of Mountain Dew.
Oh, really?
I could easily make you a pair. You could have-- they're prescription--
Okay, so I wanna put this out to the group and see how it lands.
Oh, shit.
-I think the police… -Okay!
…are and always have been, by the way,
fucked up towards Black people.
And I, for one, hate it.
-To be fair, it's an impossible job. -Dad.
Okay, Mom, I'm gonna help you in the kitchen.
-[Shelley] What? -[Ezra] Now.
You've never offered to help with anything in your life.
We're gonna do it now.
-Know what else too? -Come on.
The National Anthem, I think everybody should kneel.
-[Ezra] Enough. Thank you. -[Shelley] No, I do. Really.
-Not just the players, in fact. -[Ezra] We're gonna go check this out now.
-[Shelley] What are you doing? -[Ezra] Thank you.
I'm sorry about my mom. -She's literally a moron. -I like your braids.
-She's literally a moron. -I like your braids.
Thank you. [sighs]
Xzibit had braids.
Uh, yeah.
Remember that show Pimp My Ride? That was a blast. I loved that show.
He seemed like such a cool dude. Such a gentleman.
You ever bump into him at any of your showbiz things?
-No. -[Arnold] No?
-[groans] Is he still in the rap game? -Dad, stop.
-What? -Just, like, producing sound.
-I like X to the Z. What can I say? -[Liza] Dad.
-Over here right now. -What are you-- What's wrong with you?
Okay, can you just cool it on everything you are doing and saying in, like, complete totality?
on everything you are doing and saying in, like, complete totality?
You are so rude and annoying.
-All right? Yes, you are. -[scoffs]
I am being me, and I am thriving.
And I have gotten through my entire life being me,
and I certainly don't need my son to tell me how to behave.
My God.
It's just with the police stuff and, like, Magic Johnson.
Like, you're talking to her like she's a Black person
and not my girlfriend who is a person.
-That's absurd. I said-- -Is it?
Yes, of course! I said, "to the group," okay?
I literally said, "I'm throwing this out to the whole group."
You weren't throwing it out to the group.
'Cause you weren't trying to hear Dad's perspective.
You never asked a question like that
in every dinner we've had for the past however many years.
-I talk about that a lot. -With who?
With all of my friends. With everybody I know. We are always--
Name one friend you talk about police brutality with.
Marilyn.
Uh, uh, Josephine…
You and Marilyn talk about police brutality?
Can't get enough of it.
-Can't get enough of that conversation. -I don't buy that.
It's a hot topic right now.
All right, look. Can we not do this right now?
Seriously.
This is about meeting that lovely woman out there.
And I gotta tell you something, I think she's absolutely wonderful.
-You do? -I do.
-And I've got a people sense, you know. -[whispers] No, you don't.
Anyway, I think she's wonderful.
She is.
What?
I am… I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
Oh, my God! Oh, my…
I'm so excited.
[Ezra] Yeah.
-[exhales] -So you're okay with that?
Of course I'm okay with that.
Why wouldn't I be okay with that? [sniffles]
I don't know. Well, she's not Jewish.
Oh, Ezra, you're my baby boy.
And you found an amazing woman who makes you happy.
End of story.
I mean, would it be nice if she were Jewish? Sure.
Our people's numbers are dwindling. -It would make your life easier. -[exhaling]
But… But this is great too!
Our family is growing in such a cool and hip and funky way, you know.
Oh, my God! I'm gonna have Black grand babies. [laughing]
Okay. Jesus Christ.
[gasps] We're a family of color. -Mom. -We are the future now.
Mom, just, please, don't ever say that or think that again.
-What? -I know it's exciting, but…

-[Mo] Well, I'm happy for you, E. -[Ezra] Thank you.
Have you talked to her family yet?
Uh, no.
Do you plan to?
Yeah, just haven't had the chance to meet them.
So you're telling me you're about to ask their only adult daughter
to marry you with this baby-ass ring,
and you haven't even met her parents?
Bro. [scoffs] White dudes really do be out here living by their own code.
You're gonna have to make up a story or something for this, bro.
Yeah, it is a small ring.
You think her family will judge me and stuff?
I'm judging you, nigga. This is terrible.
Yeah, I thought of that. I thought of that.
I'm just gonna be like, "It's my grandma's Holocaust ring."
-That's good. That's great. -I mean, game over.
They can't say shit. Once you drop the Holocaust, they're like…
But you gotta get it out this box. -It's not a Holocaust box. -You're right.
Yeah, you wanna put it in, like, a satchel, dirty it up.
-Yeah. -I think you should Holocaust it down.
Yeah, we gotta Holocaust it down, for sure.
-Indeed. -Yeah. All right, that's a good call.
-There's a plan. -Thank you, dude. I appreciate it.
It is so nice to meet you guys.
What's going on? Tell me about life.
What's going on? Tell me about life. How are you? How's work?
Talk to me.
Work… Work is fine.
Grinding. I know.
I know. I'm in the grind myself.
So do you hang out in the hood all the time, or do you just come up here for our food and women?
It's a valid question.
-It is. -[mother] Mm-hmm.
I guess I'm one of those guys who kind of goes wherever.
You go wherever?
Yeah, I'm kind of like a chameleon in that way, I guess.
You know, I'll pop into Marathon and grab a hoodie and some socks,
or, you know, go play ball at Langston Hughes Park
if there's a good run going,
and Roscoe's is obviously one of my go-to's.
I mean, the Carol C. Special. Come on! Where's our waiter?
I'm gonna go see if the waitperson's here
because I feel like we should get it,
'cause I think you guys deserve more than this.
This is your white granddaddy coming back to haunt me.
-What? -That nigga never liked me.
And it started off by him putting them strong ass genes in you
that lighten up the coffee in my babies.
-Akbar, you sound ridiculous. -Yeah.
And then he planted a poison pill in my little baby girl
and it has grown into this white boy that has invited us to lunch at Roscoe's.
Those children got beautiful cultural experiences
from those moments with my granddaddy, so please stop.
-What they got was confused, clearly. -They are not confused.
They are confused. You don't think this is confusion?
All I'mma tell you is we don't need to be arguing in front of the white boy, okay?
I'm not gonna change how I feel about this…
I'm saying what I wanna say,
and I don't give a fuck about this white boy.
I'm not asking you to do that.
Hey, gang.
[clears throat] I'm back. I spoke to the waitress,
and she was upset that I interrupted her smoke break.
Um, so, you guys are probably wondering why I asked you to… to lunch.
It crossed my mind.
-Yeah, what the hell is this about? -[Ezra] Um…
I wanna… I wanna… I wanna go way back for a second.
I wanna go back to…
Well, let's go with Jesus,
'cause Jesus Christ was half Black, half Jewish, right?
Let's start with Jesus. Legend, right? So…
Jesus Christ, technically, I imagine, had mixed-race children,
which I think is… is great because mixed-race people are really awesome.
You know, you have, like, Mariah and Derek Jeter,
and then, of course, you have the GOAT. He was mixed race.
The GOAT?
The Greatest of All Time.
Yeah, I know what it means, but who are you referring to?
Our guy, the legend. Malcolm X.
-Our guy? -[Akbar laughs]
-Not-- the GOAT. Not… Not my guy. Mr. X. -[mother laughs]
And I'm saying that, like, he's mixed race
and then if Amira and I had a kid, that kid would be mixed race,
and it would be a very nice baby.
Maybe not as important as Malcolm X, but maybe. Maybe!
Maybe my son would be as important as Malcolm X.
I don't know 'cause I haven't--
And she's not pregnant. She's not pregnant.
Because we don't even do that much stuff
and when we do,
I… I am careful.
And she's not a prude.
She's gr-- really, she knows her way around it.
-Okay. -What I'm saying is I love your daughter!
I… I love her, and I would make a good husband.
What in the mother of--
I know I quoted Forrest Gump.
Yeah, you know what? I did quote Forrest Gump.
Because you know who Forrest's best friend was in the world?
Bubba.
-What? -And was Bubba Black and Forrest white?
You bet your fucking ass they were.
And… And you know what? It wasn't about race.
It was about shrimp and partnership, and they made it work.
And Amira and I have done a lot of the similar stuff
that Bubba and Forrest did together, and now we're here,
and I just wanna marry your daughter, if that's okay.
We never seen no fucking Forrest Gump.
-Ain't this about a bitch? -[exhales]
So it's not bad enough that y'all make me have to get a vaccine
so I can go into the casino.
-Now y'all coming after my kids? -[mother groans]
So you wanna marry my daughter?
Yes. Yes, I do.
Well, Ezra…
you can try.
-[knock on door] -No, that's him right now, Mama.
-Oh, okay, I'll call you back. -[phone beeps]
Hey, what's up?
I just got off the phone with my mom.
Oh, you… you did? Yeah, what… what did she have to say?
About…
Well, she just told me that you took her and my dad out to lunch.
It was a nightmare, okay? I totally blacked out. I fucked up.
I have no idea. I don't remember anything.
Well, lucky for you, my parents remember everything.
Why would you take my parents to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles
and without asking me?
I was taking a shot at something, okay? Just forget it.
Forget it? Oh, no, please, Ezra, keep going,
'cause I would love to know about this little brilliant plan of yours.
[exhales] You wouldn't understand, okay?
Oh, my God.
-[Ezra] I was gonna take your parents out… -Wait, oh, my God.
-We were gonna have a great time, -Oh, my God. And then I was gonna ask their blessing,
and I had this whole cute proposal planned,
where I was gonna reenact our first few dates, but then it got messed up.
-No, it's not messed up. It's not. -No, it is, 'cause your dad--
-No, it's not. Ezra! Ezra! -Like, it's ruined.
-What? -You can still go through with it.
When?
-Now! Right now! -Like now?
Yes, right now.
-Right-- -Hurry up!
Okay, I'm gonna take off my shoe so I don't crease it.
Amira… [exhales]
-I love you so much. -Hmm.
I have never felt so understood by somebody in my entire life.
I am blown away by your beauty
and your intelligence and your grace.
And now you just do whatever you wanna do.
And if you let me,
I will do everything in my power to give you the most beautiful life,
filled with love and laughter and joy.
Amira, will you marry me?
Of course.
You will?
-[Amira chuckles] Yes! -Oh, my God.
Oh! Oh, my God!
It's from the Holocaust, so that's why it's small.
-[Amira] Oh, I love you. -I love you.
[Amira] I need some color, look.
Sorry it's so small.
No, it's beautiful.
So what's the story again? It's your grandmother's?
Yeah, it's my grandmother's. It was her--
She got it in the Holocaust or whatever.
But like, how old is she if it's from the Holocaust?
It's been a minute. I don't know.
I think she got engaged when she was, like, three or four years old.
-It was a different time, you know. -So stupid.
-It was a different… -What is wrong with you? [laughing]
[Ezra] Don, known you my whole life. You've been an incredible boss.
I grew up with your kids. Been on family vacations together. You've always looked out for me.
Been on family vacations together. You've always looked out for me. -Mm-hmm. -Been like a father to me.
And working for you these past ten years has been life-changing.
But it's time for a new adventure.
That's it? That was great!
-That was really good. -An adventure in podcasting.
Uh, maybe leave the podcast part out.
I'm gonna throw up.
No, wait, no, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Listen.
-Dude, I'm… [sighs] -Listen. Listen to me though. Relax.
You're doing the right thing. You just gotta do it.
You understand? You got the juice!
Repeat that. "I got the juice."
I got the juice.
-I got the juice. -I got the juice.
Say it with some nuts. I got the juice.
-I got the juice! -Believe in yourself!
-I got the juice! -I'm not a buster. I got the juice.
I'm not a mark-ass buster like Don. I got the juice, bitch!
-Period. -Period!
Okay. Now, when you get home, we're gonna watch Juice,
because I'm sure Shelley didn't let you watch Juice growing up.
That is so disrespectful.
-Is it? -I've seen Juice more than you. -Ooh! [laughs] -I love you.
-Ooh! [laughs] -I love you.
-I love you. You got this, okay? -Thank you. All right.
Come on, Don! You little bitch-ass Don!
I'm coming for you, Don!
-Okay. -[Ezra] Come on!
[Don] I do not care, Javier.
-[exhales] -[Don] Just get it!
I don't give a rat's ass, okay? How about that?
My Maserati sounds like it got gangbanged by the Toronto Raptors,
so fix it!
Jesus!
What's up?
-Cars, huh? -[Don sighs]
Yeah.
On… On that.
I, uh, I don't…
I don't think I'm gonna--
I think I'm gonna not come to work at this address…
-What? -…anymore.
What are you talking about?
[splutters] At a different address, I'm gonna work--
I'm not gonna work here at this address, so I'm gonna, like, do a different place
that I'm gonna do the work from that's different work.
Are you trying to quit on me?
Yeah. Goodbye.
Pathetic. Who resigns in Helvetica?
Wait, so you said, "Fuck you, Don"?
Pretty much.
What did he say?
He was like, "You're a great guy. And like, I'm sorry that--"
"Like, I wish I did better in a weird way too."
And I was like, "It's all good, but also like, don't…"
-Period. -You know, period.
Oh, I love that.
-To the juice. -To the juice!
All right.
Let's talk wedding before I think too hard about what I actually just did.
[inhales] Um, sure.
Huh. That's a super reassuring response.
No, babe, I'm sorry.
Look, you know I love you to death. I really do.
I'm just a little worried.
You know, since we got engaged and got the house, my family,
they've just been on my head and not in a good way.
So they hate me.
-No! No, no, they don't. -Your family hates me.
They just don't know you yet, you know. And I think…
Look, this is gonna take some getting used to for them.
I mean, and can you honestly say that your family's excited
to have my Black ass in the picture?
I think a good portion of them are.
For sure.
[sighs] All right.
Let me think about this.
From where I'm sitting, I think there's only one thing left to do.
[Shelley] I mean, there are just so many primary colors in this space.
-Which is very uplifting. -[Arnold] Alive.
It really is.
-And we are so thrilled about this. -[mother] Mm.
-Mm! -[Shelley] I mean, they're just precious.
So have you cuties made any, uh, wedding plans yet?
You know, we've thrown some ideas around.
Yeah, we're thinking something really small and intimate
that really just represents us.
But we should probably talk about who's gonna officiate the wedding.
Oh, Arnold already talked to Rabbi Singer.
Singer is in!
[Shelley] Yeah, he'd be honored.
Rabbi Singer.
-[mother] Hmm. -So you're not gonna go with an imam?
-[Amira hesitates] Um… -Who's Auntie Mom?
-There's no Auntie Mom. It's an "imam." -Imam.
Mm. I'm so sorry. Can you spell that for me?
I'll spell it for you later. It's like a rabbi for Muslim people.
-Thank you, Ezra. -[Arnold] Oh.
-[mother chuckles] -Oh, so you're all Muslim?
-Yes. -Oh, yes, very much so.
I love it.
That's why I wear this crown.
I love your crown. It's gorgeous.
Babe, you wanna, um, tell them the story behind that crown?
Well, this kufi that I'm wearing right now
was actually a gift from the honorable Louis Farrakhan.
Mmm! Love Farrakhan.
You… You love Farrakhan?
Love him. Can't get enough.
He's… He's one of the GOATs. He's another one of the GOATs.
-Really? What do you love about Farrakhan? -Yeah, what do you love about Farrakhan?
Probably the same stuff that you do, just more stuff.
Can you be a bit more specific?
Yeah, um,
I think what I love about him is his general vibe.
-[Akbar] Ah. -He's got kind of a no-frills attitude.
And I just think he tells it like it's gotta be told sometimes.
-Just stop, babe. -For sure, yeah.
[mother] Ooh! Oh, babe, maybe you should finish telling them
about our private dinner with the minister.
Oh, well, we were blessed to be in Brother Minister's company,
and, uh, I got to speak with him for maybe, like, an hour or so.
-Oh. -[Akbar] We talked about everything.
How far we've come and how far we have to go as a people.
No kidding.
And at the end of the conversation, he actually took this kufi off
and put it on my head.
So this is one of my most treasured gifts.
-Isn't that incredible? -Yes.
Are you familiar with, um, the minister's work?
Well, I'm familiar with what he said about the Jews.
Let's have dinner. -Yeah. -I am fucking-- so fucking hungry.
Let's get up and do it. Whoo!
I found this great new Sirius station on the radio.
-It's '90s West Coast bangers. -Hey! It has all the stuff.
Yeah, Dad, I see you driving down Xzibit highway,
and let's refocus it to this dinner that Amira made,
because she's a genius.
-[chuckles] Okay, well, let's dig in. -All right.
So wait, wait, wait, wait. We're not gonna say grace first?
-[Ezra] No, I mean, yeah. -Yeah.
Oh, I was gonna say grace.
-I mean, we say grace all the time, so… -All the time.
[Ezra] Muslim style, so because you're here,
maybe out of respect, you would wanna lead.
-[mother] Mm-hmm. -Well, I will do the honors.
[Akbar] All praises be to Allah, who fed us and provided us with drink…
[whispers] Close your eyes.
[Akbar] …and made us from among the Muslims.
All praises be to Allah, who fed me this and provided it for me
who fed me this and provided it for me without any power or might from myself.
-Correct. -[Akbar speaking Arabic]
-Amin. -[Ezra] Definitely.
-Amin. -Amen.
-[all] Amin. -[Shelley splutters]
I couldn't have said it better myself.
So, Ezra tells me that you guys used to have a boat growing up.
[Shelley] Yeah.
I was thinking that maybe one day we can rent a boat and go out.
we can rent a boat and go out. -Hang out. -[Arnold] Oh.
-All of us. -That would be really fun. -I can make that happen. -We'll think about it.
-I can make that happen. -We'll think about it.
Because Black folks don't really have a good relationship with boats.
[laughing] That's very true. Or water.
[chuckling] Kind of like Jews with trains, right?
-[Arnold] Wow. Bingo. -[Shelley] Hmm.
[scoffs] Are you trying to compare the Holocaust to slavery?
Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm not doing-- I mean, I wouldn't do that.
Al… Although, you know, if you think about it,
I think the Blacks and the Jews have a similar struggle.
-[Arnold] Hmm. -[Shelley] Yeah.
No. So you are kind of sort of comparing the two.
-Just a little bit. -Can you pass the potatoes this way, hmm?
Well, the Jews were technically the original slaves.
-Right? OG slaves. -[Shelley] Oh, that's interesting.
Oh, you going all the way back to Egypt.
Okay, well, you do know that that was 3,500 years ago.
Slavery is one great-grandparent away for us.
-That is correct. -You know. My grandmother picked cotton.
Well, Daddy, I don't think that they were trying--
-No, it's true, honey. -My grandmother picked cotton.
I don't have to go back to Egypt. I just go back 75 years.
You know, Jews make up one-half of 1% of the world's population,
because we were systematically annihilated.
Exactly.
The one and one-half percent of the population that you make up
seems to be doing pretty good right now.
Uh, yeah, okay, but… [chuckles]
Here's the thing. It's not like we don't work hard for it.
You know? I mean Arnold, he works super-duper hard in his practice.
-He's a podiatrist. You do, honey. -And… And what did his father do?
He was a podiatrist.
And what about his father?
He was a… a podiatrist.
-Yeah, so… -[Arnold] Well.
-And a bookie. -Yes, he did that on the side.
He went straight.
[Shelley] All I'm saying is that our people
came here with nothing like everybody else.
Actually, you kind of sort of came here
with the money that you made from the slave trade.
-What? Oh! -[Akbar] Preach.
-Preach, Mother. Preach, Mother. -[Arnold] Holy moly.
-Come on. -It's true. It's very tr--
-I would like to see your sources on that. -Baby, go get my purse.
I've got my slave receipts in my purse.
-Go get my purse. -[Akbar] Take that off the table.
-Go get my purse. -[Akbar] Take that off the table. I don't turn on the news every day and see people in yarmulkes getting shot
I don't turn on the news every day and see people in yarmulkes getting shot
by police because they was out minding their business. Okay, first of all, you have no idea what you're talking about.
Okay, first of all, you have no idea what you're talking about.
-A very uncomfortable conversation. -[chattering]
Ever figure out what happened with the potatoes? An ETA on those?
I'm trying.
Are you okay?
I think we need to blow the candles out. I'm getting an allergic reaction.
Babe, can you move the candles?
-Yes. -Can you get these candles out of here?
-Yes. -Can you get these candles out of here? -[Shelley] Yes. -Candles smell like shit.
-[chattering] -No, it's okay. I got it.
When my grandmother was picking cotton, your grandfather's picking feet.
Yes, I agree.
[Ezra] I just want you to sit down. I am hosting.
-[chattering] -No, no. There they go!
I am supposed--
-Oh, shit! Oh, shit! -[screaming]
-Oh, shit! -[Ezra] Oh, shit! -Grab some water or something! -[Akbar] Oh, shit! What the fuck!
What are you doing? Hey! No!
-[shouting] -No! No!
-Stop it! -I'm sorry! Oh, my God.
[mother] Oh, Lord.
Oh, shit.
What are we gonna do?
-About the kufi? It's gone, baby. -No, our parents.
Who cares?
Like, we don't even have to worry about that.
I mean, your dad's intense, yeah, but we knew that going in.
What is that supposed to mean?
Guess it's supposed to mean that he didn't smile or make one joke--
Oh, wow. Are you trying to say that my dad's an angry Black man?
I never said he was angry, no.
Yeah, but you're saying a Black man is intense,
which is insinuating that he is.
He is Black, and he's intense.
Yeah, but you don't say that as a white person about a Black person,
calling them "aggressive" or "intense."
That's being passive-aggressive saying that he's an angry Black man.
-Should I say he's not intense? -Say nothing about my dad.
If anyone should have any beef, it's with your mom.
She set my dad's kufi on fire.
What's wrong with my mom? I mean, yeah, she's, like, an idiot,
but she still, like, means well.
It's not like she did it on purpose.
Mm. Yeah, I don't know about that.
All right, I'm not gonna argue about something so ridiculous, okay?
[sighs] All right, let's talk about the rabbi.
I don't think we need that. Let's just have a friend of ours do it.
[inhales] Um, I would like to use our imam.
Your imam?
Okay, Miss Shakur. When did you get so Muslim?
Okay, Miss Shakur. When did you get so Muslim? I've been Muslim. I was born Muslim.
And it's important to my dad, so I think we should go with it.
Was that Muslim bacon you ate yesterday? It actually was. It was Jewish bacon.
-Jewish bacon? -Yeah.
-I don't claim to be super Jewish. -Okay. -I eat bacon all day. I don't care. -Okay. Well, so what? And?
-I eat bacon all day. I don't care. -Okay. Well, so what? And?
-Yeah, you want an imam to marry us. -So?
Want me to face the bed towards Mecca?
-I can do that. -Actually, I do. Very much so.
Okay, cool, I love that four hours ago you became a devout Muslim.
-For sure. -Your dad's not even that Muslim!
He heard "Fight the Power" once and changed his name from Woody to Akbar.
Okay, now you're going all out of line. Relax.
-You told me that. We joke about it. -Yeah.
But I didn't tell you that for you to turn around and tell me. You're being-- Really, low-key, you're being an asshole.
You're being-- Really, low-key, you're being an asshole.
-I'm being an asshole? -Yes.
-[Ezra] Okay. -[exhales]
You know what? I really-- I don't wanna fight. I can't.
I don't wanna fight about it, okay?
We just had too much going on tonight. I just… I can't.
Me either. I don't wanna fight about it either.
[inhales] Look, I think our time would be best used
if we just think about how to move forward.
I agree.
I'm gonna pitch that we just never speak to these people ever again
and just a full, clean break.
We cannot do that.
You know, I'm thinking that maybe if we spend more time with them together,
maybe you and my dad can kind of hang out, just you and him.
Sounds rad.
Then I think he can get comfortable with you, you know.
And then maybe he'll see what we have going on.
Just might make him feel, you know… and you too.
-Okay. -Okay.
-[sighs] -Okay.
I gotta go to sleep. I started my period, and it's just been hell.
Yeah, I'm worried too,
'cause I haven't gotten my period in, like, 35 years.
-I should see a doctor or something. -[both laughing]
Amira told me that you gave up a job in finance
so you could start a podcast.
[sighs] Yes, that is true. I know it sounds crazy.
Oh, so you do know that that sounds crazy?
Yes, yeah, I mean, I do. I mean--
-You know it sounds crazy. -I do. I do, and she, you know…
Look, she's amazing, and she was like,
"Life is short, and you gotta follow your dream," you know.
How are you gonna support my daughter by following a dream?
Do you have, like, some dream Bitcoin
or a dream 401(k) or some shit?
I don't have a dream 401(k).
But I am gonna give it everything I have.
[accented] You're gonna give it everything you've got?
That sounds like some white boy shit.
"I'm gonna give it everything I've got!"
[Ezra] Yeah, I see it. I can handle the jokes like that, for sure.
[Akbar] I'm not joking.
No, I know you're not joking. I think that's-- I'm saying you're doing a good--
I'm not trying to do shit. I'm saying what you just said.
[Ezra] Right. You weren't doing an impression.
Again, I wasn't saying you were doing an impression.
[Akbar] Nigga, I don't do impressions.
I don't think-- I don't even-- I don't think you do impressions.
[Shelley] You know, I really did enjoy meeting your parents the other night,
but I felt so horrible about your father's kufi.
-You know? -[sighs]
I… I actually… I have a little piece of it left,
and I was thinking maybe I could frame it or something.
-Oh, no. It's okay. -Yeah.
-You sure? I could take it to Michaels. -Oh, yeah.
And they actually do a pretty good job.
You wouldn't think it for a craft store, but they do.
[hesitates] He has a lot of kufis at home. It's fine.
-Oh, he does? -Yes.
Oh, okay. He's got a kufi closet. [laughs]
No, it's not a closet.
-[Shelley] No, I'm just making a little… -It's actually a respectful situation.
[Shelley] Oh, yes, absolutely. I'm sure it's just a nice shelf, yes.
-["N****s in Paris" playing] -Oh! Love this song!
Sorry. I love this song.
Yeah, it's a hot one.
-It's provocative. Gets the people going. -Why--
Why you like this song so much?
Oh, it's amazing, man. It's provocative.
Yeah. What, you like the lyrics?
I just think it's, like, a jam. It's just a jam, you know.
Yeah, you know what?
What's the title of this song again? I forgot the name of this song.
-The name of this song. What is it? -[Akbar] It's so provocative. -What is it? [mutters] -♪ This shit crazy… ♪
I don't know. I think-- is it "In Paris?"
I don't know. I think-- is it "In Paris?" [Akbar] Something about something in Paris.
-What is it? -It's "Midnight… Midnight in Paris"?
-That's not it. -Is it "Midnight in Paris"?
It's not "Midnight." It's not "Midnight."
It's somebody else is in Paris.
-A pack of pals in Paris? -That's close.
Are you cold?
-No. -There's seat heaters even.
-Oh. No, I'm okay. Thank you. -Okay.
-["Rise Up" by Andra Day playing] -[gasps] Ooh, I love this song.
-["Rise Up" by Andra Day playing] -[gasps] Ooh, I love this song. It is so fire.
-Do you love it? -[music continues playing]
-Oh, yeah, I know this song. -♪ I rise unafraid, I rise up ♪
Oh, it kills me.
♪ A thousand times a day ♪
Don't you love that part?
You know, it's so funny 'cause I think I don't know the title of the track.
But I think-- And that's not what I respond to.
I think I respond to more what it's about, which is like friendship with a Parisian backdrop.
which is like friendship with a Parisian backdrop.
♪ Mountains ♪ ♪ Pretty Jewish feet ♪ [vocalizing]
♪ Mountains ♪
-[music continues playing] -It's about everybody, you know.
More your friends maybe together than mine--
[splutters] But we… we should go to Paris.
-Or the four of us. -Four of us will go to Paris.
Then we'll be just like this record.
If we went to Paris. Almost like this record.
It'll be 75% of this record if we went to Paris together with you.
I'm not putting the math together on it, but…
Can't quite do that note.
[man 1] Hey, nigga, didn't I tell your ass no guns in here?
-[chattering, laughing] -[man] Put that away. That's the third time I told you. God damn it!
That's the third time I told you. God damn it!
Oh, hey, what's up, Ak?
-What's going on, Ant? -[Ant] I'm all right.
-You got me? -Oh, yeah, man. Yeah, you and your, uh…
You and your pigment-challenged friend have a seat there.
I got a bleeder. Let me get this Gorilla Glue.
[inhales] I hope the wait ain't too long.
You don't have a problem with getting lined up here, do you?
Yeah. I'm chilling. This place is dope.
That's right.
Although, there appears to be a dress code that I wasn't informed of.
[Akbar] Great, then we're good.
Hey, Ak, what's up with White Cuzz?
Well, I don't know, man. You know, honestly, I don't really know this nigga.
Am I White Cuzz?
-Well, I'm not. -Hey, yo, White Cuzz.
I'm White Cuzz, for sure.
What's up, man?
Why don't you do me a favor, slide out of that dead hoodie for me?
Your hoodie, nigga, wrong color. Why don't you take that shit off?
Oh, shit.
Oh, yeah, you know what? It is humid as fuck. Definitely.
It's funny. You were so cold in the car a second ago.
I know, because the AC was blowing at my throat.
And I was scared of getting strep, and then I'm not anymore,
because we're in this, like, small place with a bunch of people.
So I'm like, it's all good. I'm just gonna take the hoodie off.
[splutters] Okay. Wait a minute. Are you sure you wanna do that?
I mean, who am I?
But what's gonna happen after you take that off? What's next?
Gonna be getting cornered by his crew out in the shower.
Fighting for your manhood every day, till you get tired and tap out.
And then you be a certified rag doll.
Certified rag doll?
Have you doing their laundry and taking your commissary tray.
And the very last face you see
before you cry yourself to sleep every night will be his.
And the first face you see in the morning
when you wake up from your nightmares will be his.
Now, is this the kind of never-ending vicious cycle
you wanna get subjected to
just 'cause you wanted to take your hoodie off?
They have a commissary here?
[Shelley] I always wanted to take my daughter-in-law on a date like this.
-Okay, I'm excited. -Yeah. Yeah.
-Hi. -[mouths] One second.
Wow. That's attitude.
Anyway, they offer this beeswax wrap here.
-[Amira] Mm-hmm. -It's actually from beehives.
-Really? -[Shelley] Yeah.
They have hives here and--
-[receptionist] Hey. -Hi.
[receptionist] Don't you look cute.
Yeah, that's no problem. Are you okay with a male therapist?
I am so sorry.
Sorry for what?
Did… Did you not just see what happened?
No, what just happened?
Okay. Just so you know, I come here all the time.
-Right? -Okay, yeah.
-And so then I come in here with you. -Mm-hmm.
And they let some white woman just go in front of us. [scoffs]
-[scoffs] -Oh, oh, I didn't…
I mean, maybe her appointment was just ahead of ours.
I can't believe what you have to go through.
-What? What are you--? -Hang on just a second.
-No, I really don't think you should-- -I got it.
Okay, you are.
Hi.
Oh, hi. [scoffs] Okay, so, um…
as a future mother-in-law
of an African-American woman in America,
I am appalled, and I am disgusted
to have witnessed the racism that I just witnessed.
Wait, what are you talking about?
Oh, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
Hey.
[chuckles] Miss Shelley. How about we get us some air?
-Uh, yeah. We're gonna get some air. -Get some air.
-[receptionist] Oh. -Um, it's under Cohen with-- with a C.
-Yep. -[Amira] Get some air.
-This looks like a decent run. -Yeah, man.
-[player] What's up, Ak? -What's up?
Hey, is this anything like Hughes Park?
Huh?
Langston Hughes Park. You mentioned that you play there all the time.
Although a pretty extensive Google search
and literally every single person I asked about it never heard of it.
No, for sure, for sure. Google's been like…
Definitely being weird. -And that's been, like, issues for me, so… -Ah!
I would take it to the Genius Bar on that one, but, uh…
Also, it's like a pop-up Langston Hughes,
but this definitely has, like, a Langston Hughes Park…
-Mm-hmm. -Sort of charisma to it, for sure.
Yeah, man, why don't you go out there and get a run in?
-Now? -Yeah, man, go play.
I think there's, like, a lot of people waiting and stuff.
Hey, can my man play?
[player] Yeah, come on in. Let's ball.
You got next.
-[player] Hurry up. -All right, yeah.
All right, now, go out there and get your Langston Hughes on.
I'm gonna.
Yeah. Hey. "Life for me ain't been no crystal stair."
-That's good. -Uh, that's Langston Hughes.
I know, dude. I say that shit all the time.
I know, dude. I say that shit all the time. That's my email signature.
-[grunts] -[player] What the hell you doing, bro?
-[Ezra] Oh, you're filming this? -Yeah, kind of.
-[Ezra] Oh, you're filming this? -Yeah, kind of. -You don't have to. -I know it. I'm doing it for me.
-You don't have to. -I know it. I'm doing it for me.
-[Ezra] Okay. -[laughs] Come on now, Langston.
Swing that. [chuckles]
-[player] Come on, dude! -[Akbar] Come on now, Langston.
You weren't filming that?
Nah, I'mma get the next one though.
Now go around him. That's right.
Come on now. Hey, y'all gonna just let him do that?
Mr. Mohammad, this was awesome. We gotta do it again.
Yeah, I had a ball.
Throw me on a text with these guys. They're too much.
-[Ezra] What are you saying? -[Mo] Dude.
Black people and white people will never be cool. Period.
-What the fuck are you talking about? -The truth, dawg.
You're my best friend and my business partner.
Yeah, that's how powerful this shit is, bro.
It's kind of like when you cheat on a woman, right?
When you cheat on a woman, it's like you try to move forward but never can.
Why? 'Cause she just keeps asking questions.
She needs to know every detail. She won't let it go, you know.
It's like, "Did you strap her?"
"Did she suck it? Did you guys do anal?"
This is not where I was expecting this to go.
Oh, I mean, it's where it needs to go, man, 'cause it's the truth.
For Black people in this country, white dudes are the cheater.
And we're the chick who can't move on.
No matter how bad we want to,
we can't forget what y'all did and what y'all are still doing.
For those who don't know who I am, I am Demetrius, uh, Amira's cousin.
Love her to death.
And, uh, I'm a wedding planner.
Okay, first off, my name is "Amira,"
and you do day parties at the airport DoubleTree.
Uh, business is expanding as it should, right?
[chuckles] I mean, if you ain't escalating, what you doing?
-You know? -Yeah.
Well, um, I am Becca and, uh, also a party planner.
-I am an old friend of the Cohens. -Yeah.
I'm sorry. I'm not trying to be rude or anything.
But why… why do we need them?
-Oh, Amira. -Look, I can't stress this enough.
But I told you stress is gonna be extra
if I'm gonna be dealing with her, 'cause I… I gotta be amazing.
Don't worry about it. She's gonna cooperate.
[Demetrius] Thank you.
You know, you really don't have a lot of time.
so I do think we have to jump in pretty quickly.
I thought maybe we could start with a theme, lock that down.
Um, and I was thinking maybe like an old Hollywood.
[gasps] I love old Hollywood.
Right? I know.
You love the period when Black entertainers
couldn't stay in the hotels they performed in?
-That's an excellent point. -[mother] Mm-hmm.
You know, I've always hated Gone with the Wind.
Way before you were supposed to.
[Shelley] Before it was cool.
See, the spirit is moving me to move in this direction, which is, uh,
I was thinking more of, like, a Tron type of feel.
You know? Remember the '80s Tron?
-No. -[Akbar] Yeah.
So we have a Tron type of wedding, but a hood Tron, you know.
Keep it…. Keep it less expensive
by having, uh, LED light suits instead of the regular suits.
Have it in the hood, having real people doing real things in the Tron world.
-I… I don't think-- -I like that.
-I… I don't think-- -I like that. -I don't. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, brother, there we are.
-I don't. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, brother, there we are.
[Shelley] A little clarity.
Do you mean that everybody wears the same suit to the wedding?
Nah, you pick your color, but you gotta get in where you fit in.
First come, first serve.
I want a red-- I want a red one.
You want the red one? We got that. So the red is gone.
[Shelley] Where do we get the suits?
Oh, I'll bring the suits, yeah.
I'll bring the suits. I got 40 hood Tron suits, and, uh, they light up.
-All of 'em work. It's gonna be great. -[Akbar] Mm.
-And you have 40 of them? -Forty of 'em.
Anybody outside of y'all wedding, more than 40 people,
then that's on y'all.
I wouldn't bring them 'cause they couldn't fit in the suit.
They gonna look weird without being in a suit.
-It'll be cool, brother. There you go. -That sounds different.
-Ain't nobody did the Tron wedding. -[Demetrius] Ain't nobody did that.
Yo, our parents are killing us.
I know.
The good news is we are almost done with it.
And they've been so busy, they're basically out of our lives.
You're right. I haven't heard from my mom in days.
It's been amazing.
Yeah, I haven't heard from my dad either, which is rare,
because he hasn't even sent one of his "form follows function" texts.
Do you think something terrible happened to him?
Oh, my God, no. Why would you say that?
No, I-- that would be horrible.
That would be the worst. I'm just making sure he's okay.
Anyway, babe, I gotta go.
-I don't wanna be late. Kiss. -You look beautiful.
Thank you.
You're gonna kill it. Remember, you got the juice.
You really haven't seen that movie, have you?
If you fucking say I haven't seen Juice one more time,
I will leave your ass.
That's why with the Victorian dress, I went with the blues and the greens.
A very rich color for this time.
And just so you guys know, I have really great relationships downtown,
and I can get high-quality fabrics for, like, a fraction of the cost.
-This is great. -Yeah.
I would love to leave you guys with some of my sketches.
[man] That would be amazing.
Man. And can you remind me when you graduated Harvard?
It's just maybe we know the same people.
I… I didn't go to, um, Harvard. I went to Howard.
Howard. Sounds kind of similar.
It's like a Black Harvard.
Interesting.
[Ezra] Let's go!
No, I'm telling you, this bachelor party's exactly what you need
to get your mind right before the wedding, homie.
I'm so fucking stressed, bro. -Oh! -I can't wait.
Vegas with the motherfucking squad, nigga. We gonna have so much fun.
Bro, I'm gonna do molly and lick a stripper's toes, man.
Shit's gonna be lit. [chuckles]
Hey. What's going on, y'all?
-Hey, what's up? -[Mo] Mm.
What's up?
Yeah, man. Hope it's not a problem me being here.
You know, I figure I'd tag along. I brought Omar too.
What's up, nigga?
Hey, Omar.
Yeah, when I found out that Amira
was gonna take your mother and sister to Palm Springs with the girls,
I figured it'd be cool for me to come hang out with the fellas.
-Yeah, that's such a good and normal idea. -Yeah.
Listen, when we're in Vegas,
I don't want you thinking I'm your future father-in-law.
I'm not that guy.
I'm just another one of the fellas, hanging out having a good time.
Hey, what's your boy's name again?
Uh, my name's Mo, and I have titties.
-Oh, I'm sorry, bro-- um, sister-- Mo. -[Mo] Mm-hmm.
-Yeah. -Yeah. [sighs]
-[man] Can I get my seat? -I'm sorry about that, yeah.
We gonna have fun.
Totally.
-What the fuck is going on? -Bro, I don't know.
But his casual nature is terrifying, all right?
He's the type of nigga that'll kill you and get a solid nine and a half hours of sleep.
I've done that.
I've done that.
Hey, did you know that Mo had titties?
Yeah, they're on her chest.
Dude, uh, so what's your plan?
We catch this kid with the beard doing weird stupid shit, and you just snitch on him to your daughter?
No, we gonna just go down there and make sure he don't have no fun.
That is very low class of you.
-But I cannot lie. That is a good plan. -Hmm.
Vegas has a knack for bringing out who people really are.
-That's right. -Can tell a lot about a man by his crew.
That's right.
Shot!
-Swallow the pill. -Ahh!
-[Mo] All right, this is for my boy. -[Ezra] Yeah.
-[Mo] All right, this is for my boy. -[Ezra] Yeah. The E to the Z to the motherfucking E. You know what I'm saying?
He's trading in his pimp card, boys.
-Yeah, this one's for me. -[Mo] Hell yeah!
-Hi! -You glowing and shit.
Ladies, who's making all the noise in the lobby?
-Hey! -Hi, gorgey!
-Well, hello, titties! Mwah! -[laughing]
-[women chattering] -Hello, girls!
Who is this white woman?
You guys, so this is Miss Shelley, Ezra's mother.
Gosh, you are all so gorgeous.
-I can't stop staring at you. -Thank you.
Honestly, it's like, these earrings
and the orange business up top.
-[laughing] -[Shelley] It's just so dope. -I can't get over it. And the hair. -It's dope.
-I can't get over it. And the hair. -It's dope.
I mean, I am straight up simping for all of you.
-[all laugh] -Yeah.
And that is a beautiful tattoo.
-Oh, thank you. -Of course. What does that say?
It says, "Rest in peace, Big Rev."
Oh, condolences.
Yeah, he was my heart.
Um, I wonder why you didn't put it… -…on your other breast. Wha-- -Mom, for the love of God.
-…on your other breast. Wha-- -Mom, for the love of God.
-[clears throat] I'm so sorry. -Yes. For your loss and for my mom.
-What? [scoffs] -[laughs]
Hey, let me get this straight.
Every single person that you know does coke, but you don't?
Yeah, it's crazy and upsetting.
It's… It's driving us apart, honestly.
I miss them the way they were, you know.
Yo! Ezra! Ezra, buddy, buddy. We're almost out.
So we need your guy's number. So we need to call the coke guy.
Your guy, your coke guy. Can we call him? Thank you.
What guy? I don't have a guy!
Ez, what? You definitely have a guy.
-You got a guy. -The coke guy from Vegas from last time.
Just call him. Quit holding out.
I think you're so high on cocaine, you don't know what you're saying.
I don't have a coke guy.
-[laughing] -No. You have a guy. We bought cocaine from him.
-He is a cocaine dealer. -[man 2] Yeah.
And we bought coke,
and you got so high that you ended up passing out on the Strip.
You had cocaine all over your face.
Wait, I think I remember you.
You… You shit your pants last time.
-Yes, you did! You shit your pants! -[all laughing]
-Yes, you did! You shit your pants! -[all laughing] -From cocaine use! You did that. -[mouths] Shut the fuck up.
-From cocaine use! You did that. -[mouths] Shut the fuck up.
Sniff, sniff, motherfuckers, guess who I found.
-[all] Coke guy! -[Mo] Exactly! Ho-ho!
Ezra! Ezra, that's the guy I was talking about.
The coke guy!
Look. Look, look at his knuckles.
Yeah, it says "Coke Guy" right there on his knuckles.
Ezra! Thank you for the Edible Arrangement on my birthday.
Such a mensch. For you, Papi.
God damn. That's a lot of cocaine you got there, Ezra.
Yeah.
Hey, you shit on yourself last time you was here?
You shat your slacks?
Yes, but not from cocaine.
It was from… It was from Chipotle.
-I'm ready. I am ready! -Oh!
-Seven letters. Plural. -Yeah, right.
A group of people who move beautifully.
Okay, you said plural, so there's an "s."
-[mother] "S." -Good.
-Oh, strippers! Strippers! -[woman] Too many letters.
Oh, wait. Oh, no, no, no, I've got it.
Is it an "n" word?
[Shelley] No.
No, no. I meant N-Navajos.
-[woman] Oh, jeez. -[Shelley] No, that's where I was going. Was Navajos, because, um…
Was Navajos, because, um… -You know, when they move, the Navajo-- -[Liza] Mom.
Mom, please.
[Shelley] What?
-Oh. Dancers! -[screaming]
Oh, my God!
What the hell!
What the hell is wrong with you?
-[woman 2] Oh, my God! -[shouts]
No, no!
[woman 2] It's okay. Your braids look good.
It's hooked onto my…
-It's okay. Somebody get her a wig. -[chattering]
-Did you know this was a wig? -No, I… I didn't know that.
I mean, this… this is kind of amazing craftsmanship, don't you think? Because--
-Gimme the girl's wig back. Gimme the wig. -What--
-Now it's all tangled up. -[woman 3] You're okay.
-[woman 1] Let's go! -[woman 2] Okay.
What ha--
-[Ezra] Was your trip as bad as mine? -[Amira] I guess you could say that.
[exhales] Yeah, mine was rough.
Did your dad say anything?
No. Why? Should he?
No, just that, uh, everything went okay, and it was totally normal, so, yeah.
and it was totally normal, so, yeah.
-Okay. -Why was yours rough? 'Cause my mom?
[Amira sighs] I don't wanna talk about it.
[scoffs] What'd she do this time?
Ezra, I don't-- I really don't wanna talk about it.
Just tell me what she did.
[sighs] Okay, she pulled the same tone-deaf shit she does all the time.
But that's what y'all do, so…
What type of shit is that to say?
I'm sorry. I just got a lot on my mind.
I'm sorry.
[Ezra sighs] Okay.
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
-Throwing this shit away. -Why?
Because I didn't get the job, Ezra. That's why.
What?
The producer called me and told me that he went with someone else.
Someone who has more period piece experience. I don't know.
[Ezra] Baby, I'm sorry.
If it's any consolation, I can hold you down for a while.
[scoffs] No, Ezra, I don't wanna be some kept woman.
I'm just trying to think of ways to help you, all right?
Like… [sighs]
-Let me-- -[Amira sighs] Let me call my family friend Rick Greenwald.
He's got connections, and he'll look out for you on your next job.
Oh, the fucking luxury.
Are you not listening to what I'm saying? Are you not hearing me?
Everything I have, I've gotten on my own.
I've worked really hard for it
and worked through all this racist bullshit,
all for you to be able to come in and call your family friend to give me a job
I probably should have got five years ago?
How do you think that makes me feel?
Well, I'm not trying to make you feel bad. I'm just trying to, like, help.
And it's okay to accept help from someone who loves you.
That's really easy for you to say because that's how life has worked for you.
That's not how it works for me.
Whatever. We have to get ready for this rehearsal dinner.
I'm going to the bathroom. Alone.
Please.
Yeah, I don't wanna go to the bathroom with you.
[Amira] Since when?
My charger's in there though.
Let me just grab my charger before you're in there for a while.
[Amira] Oh, my God!
-Woody! -Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
My name is Akbar Mohammad, bro.
Oh, man. Mama named you Woody. I'm calling you Woody.
Yeah, Mama didn't give birth to no fake-Versace-wearing,
PPP-loan-scamming career criminal, but here we are.
This is Versace.
Nigga, please.
Anyway, I ain't no criminal, okay?
It was a peeping Tom charge, okay?
I was looking in there, peeping to see if my baby mama was cheating,
so I could get lower prices on my child support.
Why peep through the window?
Because I wanted to see somebody have her broke down over, like a shotgun.
That ain't gonna lower your child support.
The judge seen her being a ho, my child support will go low.
Can't go up in the judge, "I seen her bent over, Your Honor."
"I should get less."
[chuckles] The judge ain't gonna give you less money.
I've done it before.
-Hi, Uncle EJ. -[EJ] Hey, baby! Hey!
This is Ezra. Ezra, this my Uncle EJ.
-What's up, Ez? What'd you say, Ez-- -Ezra.
-Famous Uncle EJ. Heard a lot about you. -This is my uncle.
[EJ] Okay.
Yeah, this is Ezra. This is the man.
-My man, all right. -[Akbar exhales]
Okay, I'm gonna go say what's up to Renee.
-[EJ] Yeah. -Y'all be nice.
We'll be nice to Ezra.
You gonna let this credit card sit here, we gonna swipe him.
He look like an AmEx, standing here with his hair slicked back.
-Oh. He lying. -[chuckling]
-[laughs] All right. -All right. Okay.
Come back soon if you want.
-Ezra does a podcast on Black culture. -Oh!
Tell him, Ezra.
Yeah, I do podcasts.
About what?
The culture.
Oh, you're gonna just say "culture" and leave "Black" out?
[EJ laughs] You gotta get that money some kind of way, baby, huh?
Give me $150 real quick. Don't tell her I asked for the money.
-I won't. I'll Venmo-- -Give me a Cîroc.
And, uh, the white Barry White something to drink.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! I got something to say.
-I got something to say. Uh… -[man] Okay, say it!
This is nice, y'all. This is real nice.
I ain't never had no, uh, wedding like this,
but I mean, I've been married three times. That's right.
Two times at the courthouse
and then one time at the Benihana's. [chuckles]
We ain't had no reservations, nothing like that.
Amira, my cousin, I just wanna say how happy I am for you and Ezra--
Girl, we just wanna say congrats. You marrying this white man.
-Girl, all these white people are here. -[scoffs]
If you like it, we love it, right? [chuckles]
-I stormed the Capitol. -[crowd gasps]
I did. I was there.
Ezra tried to stop me.
He's a liberal cuck, but he's a good man.
To my best friend Ezra, who's kind and thoughtful,
but for whatever reason didn't think to sit me on the Black side of the table,
which just aesthetically makes sense, you know.
Cheers to inclusion and our newly found generational wealth.
"He left the family early, um,
leaving his mother responsible for everybody, including the house."
"And after Mom died in 1984,
Xzibit had no choice but to move in back with his father in New Mexico."
I… I wanna say… I wanna say it was Albuquerque.
-Okay. I think we can wrap it up. Yeah. -I think.
That vaccine…
makes you gay.
So the moral of the story is
never date a woman who don't respect your wife.
No, I didn't mean to-- I said the wrong shit. [sighs]
Can I have everybody's attention, please?
Attention, everyone.
Yeah, I know it's, uh, it's customary for the father to give a speech on the wedding day.
But I thought there was some things that I needed to, uh, address tonight.
when a man's daughter gets married,
they say that the man is giving her away.
Now, that's a really hard pill to swallow.
Because you don't usually know
who the man is that you're giving your daughter away to.
Usually.
But I consider myself fortunate,
because I think I kind of do know who Ezra is.
And he's not a drunken, drugged-out, dream-chasing whore monger
who surrounds himself with a bunch of, uh, racist degenerates.
I didn't get that guy.
I got this guy.
[EJ] All right, okay, okay.
So, here's to my beautiful baby girl.
-[all] Cheers! -[mother] We love you.
-[all] Cheers! -[mother] We love you. [Shelley] Congratulations!
Thank you, sir.
Hey.
Oh, Ezra.
Thank you for, uh, what you did back there.
What did I do back there?
Your speech.
You could've, uh, could've blown up my spot.
You didn't, so thanks.
Well, save your thank you, 'cause I didn't do it for you.
I did that for my daughter.
You think I'm gonna embarrass her in front of her whole family?
No.
You don't know me too well.
But here's the thing. I know you.
I've known you from the very start.
I had your number from day one.
And for the life of me, I do not know why my daughter continues to go down this path with you.
I do not know why my daughter continues to go down this path with you.
There's one thing that I'm crystal clear on,
is that you are absolutely, positively, unequivocally
not the right the guy for my daughter.
Period.
-Why? -Excuse me.
Why am I not the right guy for your daughter?
Well, shit, where do I begin?
Anywhere.
Well, what… what about we start at your bachelor party?
When I saw you in the room with the strippers and the cocaine,
how about we start there?
Why don't we start with
why you were at my bachelor party in the first place?
You had no right to be there. Bachelor parties are for people to be weird.
That's not who I am.
Okay? It's my dumb fucking friends.
But you deeboed your way in, and you got what you wanted.
I had a shitty time.
As a matter of fact, I have a shitty time whenever you're around.
You're like the cooler to my life, and I don't know why.
Because the truth is all I've ever done
is love your daughter,
wholly and completely.
And she loves me,
and we wanna marry each other.
And you just decided before you even met me
that you hated me.
[scoffs] And then once you met me, you put all your energy
[scoffs] And then once you met me, you put all your energy just towards, like, smoking me out
or trying to prove I don't belong around Black people,
or that I'm a researcher and not a witness.
That's why you brought me to play ball at that park.
Why you brought me to that Crip barbershop while I'm wearing a red hoodie like an idiot.
It's why you fuck with me about my podcast and my music taste and how I talk
and how I think and who my friends are
and basically everything that I'm a part of.
And I just take it. I take it!
I take your shit. I take it all day.
And it did teach me one thing that you were right about.
[Akbar] And what's that?
I will never, ever, ever
know what it's like to be a Black person in this country.
But I do know what an asshole is.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I'm really pleased with the way-- and they're such a nice group of--
Oh, Amira! Amira. Hi!
Would you excuse me for just a second?
-Oh, my gosh! -[Amira] Hi.
Hi! I just wanted to stop you and tell you that I think you look so pretty.
Thank you.
Is that a roller set?
-Hmm? -Your hair. Is it a roller set?
Um, no, it's not.
Oh. Shoot. Okay. It's not individuals, right?
[Amira] No.
No? Okay. Shit.
All right, well, I guess I'm gonna have to go back to the drawing board.
I, uh-- Ever since the bachelorette party…
[Amira] Mm-hmm. …I just did this really deep dive on Black women's hair.
And, um, oh, for example, I watched the Chris Rock documentary.
I don't know if you've had a chance to see it. It's absolutely fantastic.
And he's so funny.
There's something about his voice that always makes me laugh.
But anyway, there's nothing funny about Black women's hair, you know. I mean, my God, I just had no idea.
I mean, my God, I just had no idea.
I mean, it really blew my mind.
You know, the energy and the time
and the… the pain and the suffering that Black women go through.
And so, anyway, I just wanted to be well-versed
for when I saw you next, and I'll let you get back to it.
Yeah, and-- but before you go, can you just tell me…
[exhales] What is this style? Just so I know for next time.
-Shelley, I'm not a toy. -[Shelley] Because I--
I really don't appreciate you treating me
like some shiny little object you can show off to your friends.
Oh, no, I would never do anything like that.
-[Amira] No, you are. -No--
-[Amira] Just let me finish. Yes, you do. -Oh, no, I--
Since I met you, I've been nothing but kind and respectful.
And it's starting to feel like
you're all happy that you have this Black daughter-in-law
now that it's cool to care about Black people.
I bet every time we hang out, you tell one of your friends,
and I can guarantee you that what you don't tell them
is that every time we hang out,
you are wildly offensive and incredibly inappropriate.
-Well, I'm not-- -[Amira] Oh, and now you're gonna cry.
You're gonna clutch your pearls and play the victim
as if everything I just said, none of that was valid.
My feelings are not valid.
Your feelings are hurt.
-Am I being too aggressive with you? -[splutters]
[Amira] Am I giving you "angry"?
The crazy thing is that I really genuinely wanted to get to know you,
woman to woman.
I thought you would see me.
-That's what I-- -[Amira] No, it's not.
Because you can't just see me for me.
It doesn't matter how many books you read or how many documentaries that you watch,
because at the end of the day, I won't just be Amira to you.
I'll always be Amira, the Black token daughter-in-law,
and that's ignorant.
Amira, are you okay?
Not really.
-Miss Shelley, are you okay? -Mm-hmm.
All right. Uh, Amira, honey.
[both] Can I talk to you for a second?
Yes.
[gasps] You wanna go first?
-I do, but it sounds like you do too. -I do. [exhales]
Ezra…
I don't know how this is gonna work.
Okay.
[Amira] It's just…
You know, your family,
my family, the whole thing,
I don't know if it's supposed to be this hard,
and if I'm being honest, I just…
Oh, God, I don't have it in me.
I'm so sorry.
Uh, I don't disagree.
The stuff with our families, like…
my mom, your dad.
Yeah, I guess I don't see it changing, so…
I do, uh, I do want you to know that,
uh, this time with you has been, like, the happiest time of my life, so…
I feel the same way. [sobs]
Okay.
[Ezra] I've been thinking about something you said.
[Mo] Nigga, if I had a dollar for every time I heard that one.
[Ezra] You're extremely unlikable. You know that, right?
-What? -Whoa-ho!
[Mo] Anyways, what did I say
that's been profoundly rattling around in your consciousness?
You said that Black people and white people could never be cool,
and I think you're right.
[scoffs] Yeah, bro, of course I was right.
I'm always right.
[chuckles] Is that what's bothering you? That I'm always right?
[Ezra] No, what's bothering me is, for a second, I believed you were wrong.
That there was hope for us. For the future.
[Ezra] That when two people from two different walks of life came together,
they could get by on their compassion for one another
and their curiosity and their love.
But at the end of the day, when it comes to Black and white people,
I don't think love is enough.
There's too many other outside factors.
Whether it be your friends or your family,
people can't accept what they don't understand.
Whether it's right is one thing, but factually, it's true.
We really do live in two worlds.
There's no escaping it.
I was raised by hip-hop shit. It's made me who I am, but even with that,
It's made me who I am, but even with that,
I still wasn't prepared for the realities of a world I'm just not from.
I'll always be an outsider.
Which is why, as fucked up as this sounds,
I feel like if you love something,
as much as you wanna share it with everybody,
I think it's best you keep it for yourself.
See, I told you. The white Barry White, he be spitting some shit!
Him and Joe Rogan.
I ain't mad at Joe Rogan for saying "nigga" every other word,
long as he don't say that shit in my face.
Man, you kind of dragged bruh a little bit.
What are you talking about? Ezra? I ain't drag him.
You drug him like a fat bitch's left foot.
No, no, no, no, no, you can miss me with all that shit.
I did exactly what any father would do.
[chuckles] You played him like a white boy,
'cause you knew you could get away with it. Tell the truth!
Oh, you would've handled it differently?
I would've got a car out of his ass.
I'd have probably started me a line of credit,
probably got me a washer and dryer, probably a bottle of cologne.
Try to get my back patio done.
This is the stuff that he probably wanna do.
You in your own reality, huh? That shit ain't gonna happen.
It don't matter what I would've did.
Times have changed. The world is different, Woody.
Akbar, bitch. My name is Akbar.
-It's the same amount of syllables-- -See? See?
You didn't see what I saw.
Him and his friends, the degenerates, was doing so much cocaine in Vegas,
it looked like they was doing a reboot of Scarface.
So that's what it's about? Cocaine?
Yes, that's one of the main reasons. Yes, cocaine.
He was doing not just cocaine. Lots of cocaine.
It was copious amounts of cocaine, everywhere.
He did so much cocaine, he shit on hisself!
-You seen him shit on hisself? -No, I ain't see him shit on hisself.
But I heard about the other time when he was there and he shit on hisself,
and everybody still talks about it. -So the whole town knows. -[laughs]
How we gonna be falling in the spot with this nigga?
[EJ] Wow.
Look, I'm not saying it's right, but you did your shit back in the day.
You remember they came out with the Cold Blooded Rick James album?
No, I don't remember the Cold Blooded Rick James album.
Okay, but coke do.
Man, we loved that album.
That was the only time I felt related to you.
And I think you shorted him a little bit.
Yeah, you… you shorted him.
And… And you shorted Amira.
Shorted both of 'em.
♪ Where did the day go? ♪
Can you please stop smiling so big? -You're freaking out the locals. -What?
Well, I'm excited that my son is gonna buy me some tennis shoes.
[scoffs] I just don't understand why all of a sudden you need a pair of Dunks so badly.
Because Diane Kaplan's son bought her a pair of tennis shoes
and the bitch won't stop talking about it.
Oh, shit.
What?
Oh, well, that's cool. We can just go in and get the shoes, doesn't matter.
I think you gotta let Diane one up you on this one, Mom. -I don't really wanna-- -[Shelley] It's…
Ezra?
Oh, uh, Amira, what's up, girl?
Mm. "What's up, girl"?
Why are you sounding like LL Cool J? What's up?
Sorry, I just wasn't expecting to run into you here.
I mean, yeah, same.
Daddy, what's going on?
Oh, fuck me.
Good timing.
Yeah. Okay, I didn't bring you here to buy me shoes.
-Yeah, starting to put that together. -Yeah.
Yeah, and, baby girl, I don't know what I told you to get you down here,
but whatever it was, it was a lie.
The truth is Shelley and I have been talking.
Yep. Uh, we screwed up, you guys.
-Badly. -Yeah.
And we feel like we owe y'all some apologies.
-Can I go first? -[Shelley] Yeah, please, go, go.
Ezra.
Brother.
Man, listen.
I been riding your back from the moment we first met,
and I'm sorry.
'Cause you didn't deserve that.
It's just I couldn't handle the fact that you weren't
what we ever thought Amira would bring home and, uh, you know…
And I never ever thought that I could see my reflection in you, so…
But I do.
And you're a good man.
And a hustler.
And most importantly,
we both love Amira very much, and we'll do anything to make her happy.
[sighs] Okay, it's my turn.
Um, Amira. [inhales] I am so sorry for everything that I did
and said that was offensive to you.
The truth is I… I was just lost.
You know, my son came home with this beautiful, amazing woman,
and I didn't know anything about her world.
I mean, I thought I did.
And I was just so excited to have a new and different culture in our family,
and I just hope that you accept my apology,
because I do apologize on behalf of all white people.
Except for the racist ones, the actual racist ones.
-[chuckles] -And on behalf of all Jewish people.
Except for Aunt Mitzi because…
-Yeah, she's racist. -She's actually racist.
She's a horrible human being. [sighs]
But really mostly on behalf of me,
Shelley Cohen of Brentwood, California.
I am so sorry, Amira,
because I love you and you are not a toy.
I see you as the real, powerful,
individual person that you are.
Thank you so much, Miss Shelley, that means a lot to me.
And I fully receive that.
It felt very genuine and sincere,
so thank you so much.
And, Ezzy.
[exhales] I'm also sorry for always getting in the way.
No, you're not.
I'm not, honey, but I love you.
-Yeah. I love you too. -I love you, baby, very much.
Okay, so…
Akbar and I had a little idea.
Yes, and we think you're both gonna like it very much.
A lot.
So, did you miss me as much as I missed you?
I missed you so much.
I even got a pair of slides the other day 'cause I wanted to feel close to you.
-[laughs] Eww! -They were Umbros. It was all they had.
-I know. -No.
-I got 'em 'cause I was so sad. -Aww.
-[Ezra] Missed you. -I missed you too.
I love you.
[rabbi] Blessings to all who are present
to witness Ezra and Amira unite their lives in marriage.
Two hearts as one.
Ezra and Amira, you choose each other to build a home,
not of brick and mortar, but a home and haven in your hearts together.
May it be fulfilled each day
as you are on this beautiful journey of love.
Just a little heavy on the tongue.
Most white people do.
Can you believe this is happening?
Yep! [laughs]
Wow. They look so happy, huh?
-Yeah, they do. -[woman shouts]
Mr. and Mrs. Cohen.

[Vivo] And that, friends, is how you do it in Havana, Cuba.
Precision, timing, not a moment out of place.
Because even though Andrés and I might not have spoken the same language,
when it came to music, we became so in sync that, well,
we finished each other's musical phrases.
Good show as usual, Vivo. Are you hungry?
-[chirps] -Do you want a croqueta?
-[chirps] -Maybe mangoes? Ooh!
Somebody likes mangoes.
[Vivo] You might look at us and think, "Those guys got a perfect life."
And you'd be right. That is… until the letter came.
That is… until the letter came.
-¡Oiga! Señor Andrés. -[car horn beeps]
Okay.
…have a letter.
Muchas gracias, Montoya.
[gasps] Marta?
But how?
Marta? Who's Marta?
"Mi amor"? Who's Marta?
"What words can I write in a letter after being separated for so many years?"
[Marta] "As I prepare for retirement, I have been flooded with memories
of the beautiful music we once made together."
"I don't know if you can forgive my silence
since we separated all those years ago."
"But nothing would mean more to me than for us to sing together again."
"My farewell concert is June 16th at the Mambo Cabana in Miami."
[Andrés] "If you are there with your tres, I'll know you feel the same."
"I hope it's not too late. Amor, Marta."
I can't believe it. Marta Sandoval!
-Did you say Marta Sandoval? -Marta's final show?
-Hold up, hold up, hold up. Who's Marta? -[man] You're going to Miami?
No, no, no, no. We go from the apartment to the plaza. That's our commute, two blocks.
[woman] You have to go, Andrés.
You can finally perform in Miami together.
What? No! This is where our audience is.
-I cannot go to Miami. I'm an old man. -Yeah, great point. Know your limits.
Come on, everyone. Chip in. ¡Suelta el billete!
Andrés y Marta. Qué romántico.
Uh, let's not get carried away.
-[indistinct chatter] -Who's Marta?
Hello?
Hey! Who is Marta?
[Vivo] Oh. Wait. This is you?
I assumed you were always an old man.
So you guys were like a duo?
[Andrés] Marta, ay.
She was the toast of Havana.
She had the most beautiful voice in all Cuba.
And, uh, she was also the love of my life.
But I never told her how I felt.
Everybody knew that she would be a big star someday.
♪ Mi canción ♪
[Andrés] One night, after another sold-out show, I knew that this was my moment.
I had finally found the courage to tell her how I felt.
But just then, we were interrupted by a promoter from the United States.
He offered Marta a chance to perform at the Mambo Cabana in Miami.
Marta was floating on air.
[chuckles] Her dream was finally coming true.
And, uh, at that moment,
I realized that if I told her what was in my heart,
she might not follow her heart.
So, I kept my feelings to myself
and said nothing.
[Andrés] Without her, Havana was empty.
I was too.
All my love, all my sadness,
I put it into a song.
It was a song too painful to play.
A song
Marta would never hear.
Here it is, Vivo.
The last song I ever wrote.
Wow. She never got to hear it.
That's so sad.
But now, my friend, I have the greatest gift in the world.
A second chance!
Second what now?

No! I'm not excited. We're not Miami guys. We're small-town guys.
-We're plaza guys. -Don't worry. Everything will be okay.
Catch!
-[giggling] -Hey!
Listen, Vivo.
I must deliver this song to Marta.
She needs to know that I love her.
It's only one song.
[in Spanish] I need you, my son!
Hey, Vivo, where are you going?
[sighing] Ay, Vivo.
What is he thinking? A plane trip to Miami.
It's been 60 years, and you go all the way there for one show?
For one song?
What difference can one song make?
What am I doing?
Come on, Vivo.
[chuckles] That suitcase isn't gonna pack itself.
[exhales] Okay.
[sighs] Beautiful day to travel.
Good morning.
Look, I'm really sorry about last night.
But I think we--
Andrés?
Havana lost a good friend in Andrés Hernández.
For years, the sound of his tres filled this plaza
and our hearts.
We were all so excited
for news that he would soon be reunited with Marta Sandoval.
But alas, it was not meant to be.
Ay, señora.
Ay, muchas gracias.
My name is Rosa Hernández.
Andrés was my late husband's uncle.
My daughter Gabriela and I are from Florida.
This is our first trip to Cuba.
-[Rosa speaking in background] -Psst. Hey. That's my mom.
My name is Gabi. -You're Vivo, right? -[chitters softly]
Hey, I know what you're going through.
-I lost my dad too. -[whimpers]
Carlos's connection to Cuba
was a bond that neither time nor distance could ever break.
Unbreakable bonds.
That's what we got. Family takes care of family, right?
See, you get it. Wait! I got a great idea.
You should come live with me in Florida.
Yeah, we're going home tomorrow. Come on, get in the bag.
Wait, wait, Vivo. Where are you going?
Are you worried about where you'll be going to the bathroom?
It's okay. I got wipes in here.
So I thank you so much for receiving Gabriela and I with open arms.
Gracias, señora.
[sighs] Ahora, amigos,
let's all take this moment to say our goodbyes as we listen to
one more song for Andrés Hernández.

[groans] It's the weird kid.
Gabi, what are you doing?
Just playing a tune.
Maybe Vivo will hear it, and I can take him back to Florida.
Oh, that's right. She's from Florida.
Gabriela, what did I say? No more pets.
-Please? -No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
And besides, we cannot take a wild animal on a plane.
So glad I caught you before you left.
Gabi, mi niña,
we know you love music, just like your Uncle Andrés.
So, we wanted to see you off with a few of his musical mementos.
Vintage maracas! Claves!
Ho ho! Check out this bad boy! [laughs]
Oh, thank you, Montoya. You gave my kid an accordion.
You feeling it, Mom?
[in Spanish] Ah, what a beautiful thing.
-[Rosa scoffs] -Music is in her blood.
-[Gabi] Cuba! Cuba! I love Cuban music. -[Vivo] Oh!
[gasps] That's it. Marta, here I come.
[Gabi] What's up, Cuba? I'll give you a backbeat.
[Rosa] Thank you. Thank you, Gabi.
I'm sure all of Cuba knows you're here.
Sorry. Guess my playing was a little too hardcore.
Playing? That noise was playing? [yelps]
Ah, bueno. Here's your taxi.
Montoya, thank you.
¡Gracias, Montoya!
Adiós. Practice that music every day.
Ugh, my head.
I guess traveling is not my thing.
Where am I? What time is it? What time is it? What time is it?
Okay, 10 a.m. Still have ten hours.
Oh, right. It's the backpack kid.
Look what I got. Hmm? Hmm?
-Are you excited about today? -Oh, yeah, of course. What's today?
It's your first cookie sale with the Sand Dollar Troop.
Yeah, I don't think that's gonna happen.
I've taken the Sand Dollars about as far as I can.
[Rosa] Gabi, what are you talking about? You've only been to one meeting.
[Gabi] I know.
-But it's time to move on. -[Rosa] Move on?
[sighs] You just started with the troop. You're still getting to know them. Ha! Tail never fails.
Ha! Tail never fails.
Please, give them a chance.
Look, I made my resignation video.
-Cookies! -[hip-hop music plays]
Peace. We out. Bye.
-Creative. -[Gabi] Wait, wait, wait!
-Creative. -[Gabi] Wait, wait, wait! This is the best part. I turned them into zombie clowns.
[grotesquely] Buy my cookies.
Gabriela Maria Rosa Hernández, you are a part of that troop.
They're counting on you. You can't just abandon them.
-[Gabi] Why? -[squeals]
Pulgita, you can't keep pushing everyone away.
If you don't at least try to get along with other kids,
you're going to be very lonely.
Gabriela, escúchame. You're doing this!
I let you keep that… that… that… that purple hair. You owe me one!
But, Mom, all they ever talk about are selling cookies,
getting badges, saving the Everglades.
It's so boring!
You're going to the cookie sale. You're going to take selfies.
And you're going to have fun and bond!
Now put on the uniform. It's really cute.
Coast is clear. Let's get out of here.
It's fine. It's just the belongings of your dearly departed great uncle.
Rolling on the floor, all by itself.
Playing spooky accordion music.
It's fine. [laughs nervously, groans]
-Vivo, you're here! -Yup. And now I'm leaving.
-You followed me, didn't you? -[coos]
And you snuck in my bag
because you love me!
-[squeaks in protest] -I'm so glad you're here, Vivo.
[gasps] Now I have someone to share my friendship bracelet with.
Best friends forever!
-Hey, let go. Paws to yourself. -Hold still.
Forever's a long time, kid! I have a song to deliver. [yelps]
-[Gabi giggles] -[yelps] Nice meeting you. Peace!
Are those little gravestones?
Oh, that's my petting zoo.
Well, it was.
[Rosa] Gabi?
It's my Mom. Hide.
'Sup, Mom? [laughs nervously]
Why did I just find this in the microwave?
I was drying it?
You were dr-- [gasps] What is that?
How many times have I told you? No food in the room.
We're going to attract animals.
Here, take your uniform.
[groans] You mean my invisibility cloak?
-Gabi. -I can feel hives coming on.
My throat is getting itchy.
It's a uniform, not an allergy.
Here. Hurry up and change. We don't wanna be late for the cookie sale.
[muttering] Yes, I do.
Did you see that, Vivo?
-She doesn't get me at all. -[drums bang]
She wants me to wear a uniform
just like everyone else.
-[guitar strums] -But I'm not like everyone else, because…

I know why you came to Florida. You're trying to find Marta.
I read Marta's letter.
Tío Andrés wanted to be at her show tonight, didn't he?
Are you trying to get there too?
But… but why?
What's this?
"Para Marta"?
Tío wrote her a song?
"Your plane leaves in the morning. Soon the world will see you shine."
"And I wish I could go with you, but your journey isn't mine."
[gasps] You know what this means?
He never got to say,
"I love you."
Vivo, this is really important. Marta needs to hear this song.
And I'm gonna get you there.
[sighs in relief] You are?
Marta's final show
is at the Mambo Cabana in Miami.
We don't have much time. But don't worry. I have a plan.
First, get in my bag.
Anything for Andrés. Anything for Andrés. Anything for Andrés.
But it's Marta Sandoval's last show ever!
-Come on, Mom, -[Rosa] What? Miami isn't that far.
Since when are you such a Marta Sandoval fan?
Since I was born. I'm a huge fan.
Name one song.
Uh, "Despacito"?
Get ready for the cookie sale. I'm not going to tell you again.
-Don't worry, I have another better idea. -[Vivo gasps for air]
Does it involve cleaning your backpack? 'Cause there's a lot of stuff in there.
Wipes are none of them. I saw no wipes.
Let's see.

Perfect. This will get us there in time for the show.

Did you know the Everglades are home to 2,000 species of plants and animals?
And 70 of those are endanger-- [gasps]

But you didn't show up yesterday either, did ya?

-What are you doing? -Oh, he's so cute.
Can I pet him?
-No. -Go to town. He loves it.
-Look at that face. -Aw!
-He's adorable. -Hey! Stop. This is borderline abuse.
-His little ears! Oh! -So fuzzy. What's his name?
His name's Vivo. And he's a possum.
-[Vivo grunts] -Gabi, that's not a possum. [scoffs] That's a kinkajou.
A very rare South American tropical rain forest mammal,
aka the honey bear.
The honey bear? Never heard it, but I'll take it.
His eyes look a little cloudy.
His coat is kinda mangy.
Has he seen a veterinarian?
Uh, sorry, what?
[scoffs] Gabi, there are rules to be followed.
For his own safety, he needs vaccinations and a week of medical observation.
-A week? -[chittering] Yes. Isolated from other animals. Didn't you read your Sand Dollars manual?
Yes. Isolated from other animals. Didn't you read your Sand Dollars manual?
Oh, yeah, the week. We did that.
Oh, good. Then you wouldn't mind showing me his vaccination certificate?
Yeah, I'll get it right now.
It's in the trunk of my bike.
[gasps] No, no, no, no.
-[chirps] Uh-oh. -Time for plan B.
Wait a minute. Bikes don't have a trunk, right?
You know, I'm starting to think she doesn't have a certificate.
Yeah, you think?
Girls, we've got us a Sand Dollar gone rogue.
Move out!
Change of plans. We'll catch the bus at the next stop.
-Pull over, Hernández! -Oh no.
Surrender the kinkajou!
Don't worry, Vivo. I'll lose them.
But what about the bus? The plan was the bus.
Well, that didn't work.
Come on, Vivo. Get back there and shake 'em off.
Ha! Take that. How fun is this?
And this should not be in a child's backpack, but here you go!
Hey! Oh, no, you didn't.
Oh, there's the wipes. Ha!
Stop! You stop right there, you little-- Ah!
Ha ha! Take that.
He's dousing himself with chemicals!
[gasps] It's a cry for help. Gabi, give us the kinkajou!
Mr. Henshaw!
You drove here?
You live two blocks away!
Shame on you!
[both] Shame.
You're in over your head, Hernández. Give him up!
Vivo, hold on tight.
-We're gonna jump it! -What?
[Gabi] Yeah! Woo-hoo!
All right, Miami, here we come.
-Ah! -No, no, no, no, no, no!
What have we done? We've allowed that poor, defenseless creature
to roam free in a world where he surely won't survive.
-So, back to the cookie booth? -Cookie booth? Uh, no!
-So, back to the cookie booth? -Cookie booth? Uh, no! It's our duty as Sand Dollars to rescue him.
Eva!
Yeah?
We're gonna need your dad's boat.
The song. Where is it? Where is it? Where is… where is… where is…
Ah. Still in one piece.
Okay, where are we? Where is that bus?
[echoing] No!
Sand angels!
Vivo, you should really try this.
Look at me. I'm a cat. Meow, meow.
Ugh. I gotta get off this boat. -Hey, Vivo. -[screams]
I know we missed the bus, but don't worry, I have a plan C.
If we take a shortcut through the Everglades National Park,
we can make it before the show.
Okay. New plan. Let's see.
Whoa, Vivo, we're so in sync.
-Just like a mind meld. -[alarmed hooting]
Oh man. I thought it could hold it.
Mind meld? If we had a mind meld, you'd be panicking,
because that was our ticket to Miami.
Now we're stuck on this giant boat headed in the wrong direction.
We couldn't be more out of sync. This is what "in sync" sounds like.
This is you and me.
We have totally different definitions of the word "plan."
To me and other rational people, a plan revolves around the Five P's.
Proper Planning Prevents Poor Performance.
But you,
your plans are just bad impulses.
What are you doing?
-Ta-da! Sometimes you gotta improvise. -[clip springs, clinks]
Yeah, that will never float.
-And the journey begins now! -[screams]
It floats. It actually floats.
-Oh! -[Gabi] Heads up.

Give me a sec. [grunts] Don't want to pull a hammy.
[exhales] Okay. Ready, Vivo?
And she missed.
I missed the boat completely.
Did you see that, Vivo?
Hysterical. [grunts]

-It'll probably blow over. -[thunder crashes]
[Gabi screams] Hold on tight, Vivo!
No!
The song!
-All right, Vivo, I'll get it. -No, no, no. I got it.
Vivo! Ah! I can't see.
No, no, no, no This can't be happening. [grunts]
Yes! [screams]
-Vivo! -No!
[Gabi] I got it!
-The song? -Don't worry, Vivo.
I'll take care of it. I promise!
Gabi!
Okay, don't panic. You just lost the song.
And it's with Gabi.
What am I gonna do? I just need a new plan.
New plan. New plan. New plan. New plan. New plan. I got it.
Gabi!
[Gabi's voice mail] You have reached Gabi's robot. Leave a message. Beep.
Gabriela Maria, pick up your phone right now! I saw the bus schedule on your computer.
If you think you're in trouble now,
ooh, it's about to get worse.
I am right next to the bus, honking. This is me.
I know you can hear me.
[muffled] Pull over!
-[bus driver] Huh? What the-- -Aah!
Uh, you're not gonna let her pass us, are you?
Not on my watch.
No, no, no, no, no. Don't you drive away from me.
-Gabi! -[car horn beeping]
[Vivo] Gabi!
Gabi!
Gabi!
She's not responding. I gotta start searching this swamp.
Birds. Bird's-eye view, perfect.
Hey, you guys! I need your help spotting somebody--
Oh, good. A bird.
Excuse me. Uh, I'm Vivo. I got separated from my friend.
Purple hair, necktie. Ah!
Ah. Could you maybe fly me up and help me spot her?
Normally, I'd help a guy out,
but… [chuckles] …I'm gettin' ready to take the long dirt nap.
What? No, no, no, no, no, no! Don't talk like that! I'm sure you have a lot to live for.
[laughs] It's not like that. Actually, I'm taking a literal nap.
Yeah, I'm just hibernating
until the end of my life.
[laughs] I mean, the end of dating season.
Dating. Sounds horrible. As I was saying--
You don't understand, Vivo. All my life I've been told,
"Don't worry, Dancarino."
"One dating season,
you're gonna find the girl of your dreams, and love's gonna pick you up."
-That's great. But I got a thing. Huh? -[birds chirping]
♪ Love's gonna pick you up And never put you down ♪
Yeah. We all know the tune. Wanna cool it with all that love? [scoffs]
Um, so, I'm kind of in a bit of a time crunch.
I've been here for eight, count them, eight straight seasons,
and instead of love picking me up, it's just dumped me in a ditch.
Tragic. Anyway--
I'm an invisible spoonbill. No one cares I'm alive.
Especially Valentina.
-Valentina's looking at me, isn't she? -Yeah.
Nobody knows I know you. You don't know me. -Good luck finding your friend. Bye! -Ah! Wait. Get out of there.
-Good luck finding your friend. Bye! -Ah! Wait. Get out of there.
-Have you tried telling her how you feel? -[gasps] No! I can't tell her.
I'm scared.
No, I've heard this song before. It doesn't end well.
Come on, I'll coach you through it. Then you'll help me find my friend. Deal? [quaveringly] Okay, deal.
[quaveringly] Okay, deal.
Now, introduce yourself.
Hi, you're Dancarino.
I mean, I'm… [voice cracks] I'm Dancarino.
Hmm. Enchanted.
-[gasps] No. Back to my hole. -No, no, no. Hey, hey, focus.
Smile and compliment her.
-Uh, Valentina. [inhales] -You got this.
Your eyes are like two huge pools--
No, they're like two big bayous in your face.
Bayous? In my face?
[groaning] Oh no.
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said about my-- [screams]
Got a frog in my throat.
-[croaks] -Sorry, Gary.
-Oh, they're perfect for each other. -[hoarsely] Oh, Dancarino. [coughing]
You have such handsome plumage.
It's nice for my eye… uh, bayous… [chuckles] …to look at.
'Cause they're actually my eyes. [laughs]
This is going strangely well.
Now, take her hand.
-Ow! -Oh, sorry. Oh!
-I'm so sorry. -No, no, no, it's fine.
I have another eye. It's totally great.
-[Valentina] Ow! -Oh! Easy with the beak.
Not too quick, Dan. Uh, yeah. Go in at an angle.
To the left. Yes.
That's it.
Now, fly away together.

Showtime's in four hours.
We need to get the lighting cues down for the finale.
Excuse me, mi niña. Any word from Andrés?
Not yet, señora. I'll double-check right away.
Thank you.
Where are you, my friend?
Vivo?
Vivo? Where are you?
Oh no, where is it? Where is it? Where's the song?
Come on. Vivo's gonna kill me. [gasps]
Ooh. It's just a turtle.
-[Troop girl] It's not just a turtle. -[screams]
Becky?
It's a Florida red-bellied cooter. It belongs here. It's native to these parts.
Unlike your friend. Where is he?
Um, he's kinda missing.
You lost a kinkajou in the Everglades?
Well, congratulations, Hernández. You've killed him.
Wait, what?
A kinkajou cannot survive in this environment.
His natural predator is every animal in here.
He needs to be quarantined. And you are gonna help us find him.
Heh. I'm not helping you.
-Then I guess you don't want this. -[gasps]
You were looking for this song, weren't you?
No, I don't care about that song.
Fine. Then we should recycle it. Eva? [gulps] Huh?
Eat it.
Yeah, all right.
Wait!
Fine, you win.
I'll wear the uniform. I'll sell cookies. I will do whatever you want.
Just give me the song back.
You get the song
when the kinkajou is safely in our custody.
Gabi!
Where are you, Gabi? [screams]
Disgusting! Who am I kidding?
I'm not cut out for this. I'll be lucky to get out of this swamp alive. -Gabi! -Shh.
Did you just shush me?
Buddy, be quiet.
Seriously? Do you have any idea what I've bee--
Are you bup-bup-bup-bup- bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-ing me?
That's it. You want me to be quiet?
[shouting] I'm being quiet!
Yeah. I thought so. Walk away, buddy.
We're in the middle of a swamp. Who cares about a little noise?
Me.
Mmm, what a lovely voice you have.
Never seen you around these parts.
My name's Lutador. You got a name?
It's Vivo.
Oh! My goodness, I hate that name.
Your new name is Noisy.
Noisy the Singing Rat. [chuckles]
Yeah. [laughs nervously]
I'm not a rat.
What… what are you? A gibbon?
I'm a kinkajou.
Mmm. Sounds exotic. Hoo.
Well, you listen right here, little kinkajou.
I hate noise.
So you must be quiet.
That's my rule, man.
And everyone around these parts understands it. Don't y'all?
Mmm. That's what I like to hear.
Absolutely nothing.
Uh, I'm sorry. I promise, you won't hear a peep from me.
You want quiet? I can do quiet. I'll be quiet.
[chuckles] I know very well you're gonna be quiet.
Deathly silent, in fact.
All my meals are.
Ho ho ho ho! Would you look at that?
Oh, my friend… [in singsong] …you're about to run out of tree.

Andrés would be so proud of you.
But, Mom, Vivo needed to deliver a love song to Marta.

No. No, you don't.

you can't just go a hundred miles to Miami without telling me.
I know. I'm sorry, okay?
But I j… I just had to deliver tío's song.

If you can give love, if you can receive love? So what?
[Eugenio Derbez in English] It's a woman? It's a man?
It's a sorcerer?
[Lin-Manuel] It was just a staple of our childhood.
If you went to visit anyone, Walter Mercado was on.
And you would be quiet until you got to hear your sign.
[Raul de Molina] Walter was unique. He was different, he was a pioneer.
...the gifted, the talented Walter Mercado!
-Do you know who Walter Mercado is? -Of course!
Some people who speak English
do not understand how loved you are in the Spanish community.
You're bigger than Jesus Christ.
He made me believe through the force of his oratory.
[in Spanish] Manifest exactly what you want.
Visualize exactly your dreams.
It will be yours.
[Lin-Manuel in English] I just think he's this positive force.
He's literally sending positive vibes through the television at you
one astrological sign at a time.
[Walter in Spanish] Follow your heart. Your heart is never wrong.
[in English] And then signing off con "Mucho, mucho amor."
[Eugenio] But all of a sudden, he disappeared.
Many people were calling in and asking. They were asking me,
Many people were calling in and asking. They were asking me, "Hey, what happened to Walter Mercado?"
I don't know.
I've lost contact with Walter.
I thought he was living in Mexico.
[in Spanish] I have a theory that he didn't want to grow old in front of the cameras.
He's sick and he retired.
He lives in a mansion in Puerto Rico that's like a huge fortress
where no one can enter.
[in English] He died two times.
Two times.
I heard that he lives in The Grove.
Maybe he's an extraterrestrial.
Probably has his own planet somewhere.
[in Spanish] People say a lot of things and invent even more.
[Eugenio in English] Where is Walter Mercado? What happened to him?
We miss him. We really miss him.
[Walter in Spanish] These are old things, very old.
[woman on TV in English] The highly successful spiritual master
has established himself as a leading authority in astrology and mysticism.
[in Spanish] Look, Willie!
[woman in English] Walter Mercado guest-starred on many popular TV shows.
[in Spanish] Look.
It's very emotional for me.
[Walter] I think that the worst things sometimes are necessary to grow up.
I've had very, very, very difficult problems.
I suffered a lot.
I lost a lot.
I want to tell you the story.
Okay. I'm ready.
I was born in the country.
Around my home, there were lots of farmers... People working, who were very, very, very poor.
People working, who were very, very, very poor.
When I was a child, I was very shy, insecure.
My mother was very overprotective with me.
And I was a dreamer. I was always dreaming.
One day, a bird fell in the yard.
And it was dying.
And I took the bird and I began to...
to... to pray and to... [blows] giving life to that bird.
A neighbor was watching.
And I said, "You're going to live, little bird. You're going to live."
And suddenly, the bird starts to flap its wings
and it starts to get better and it began to fly.
And the lady said, "Oh, this boy has the grace of God
to help, um... to heal people."
And began to talk about me.
People in the village would knock on the door of my house
and ask my mother, "Oh, please, please let me see Walter."
So my mother put me in a little chair and they began touching me.
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch.
And then I turned into "Walter of Miracles."
Since the moment I was born,
I know that I was not like everybody.
When I saw other boys, I know that I have another way of life.
My brother was all the time riding horses,
planting the sugarcane, leaving with my father.
And I stay with my mother, playing the piano and reading books.
Everything about me was different.
My mother said, "If you're different, go on being different.
Don't worry about that.
To be different is a gift.
To be ordinary is common."
I decided, at that time,
I'm going to fabricate, create a famous person in me.
And so I know that that push is going to explode in something important.
My little doll.
Willie?
[in English] Yes, Walter.
-My vitamins? -Yeah.
These are the different multivitamins that Walter takes.
Salmon oil for the cholesterol.
Eyebright for the eyes.
Collagen peptides.
Cod liver oil.
Pycnogenols.
Hemp proteins.
My name is Willie Acosta,
and I'm Walter Mercado's assistant for many years.
Many years.
[interviewer 1] So you're like his right hand?
And the left one, too.
[in Spanish] Look what I got for Runo.
[in English] Pet wipes.
-My dog never stinks. -Stinks. He's stinky.
Never... No, he never stinks.
I came to Walter's life very young.
I'm still a young adult. [laughs]
But I was very young when I came to Walter's life.
[Walter] Willie belongs now to my family.
I have many nieces.
Ivonne,
Betty,
Bibi and Dannette...
and Carmensita and Charito. [in Spanish] What's her sign?
[Carmen in English] Her sign is Sagittarius.
And she is Pisces.
[Walter] I love my family.
But Willie is with me always.
He assists me with my clothes, with my costumes.
[Willie] I do many jobs.
I assist Walter in everything that he needs.
I take Walter shopping. I have gone to the movies with Walter.
We fly together to places.
We stay in the same hotel in the same room.
[Walter] He knows everything. All my secrets.
Very small secrets, of course...
-Thank you. -You have to eat cookies, too.
-They're good for the system. -You want to see me fat?
Not fat, but, you know, healthy.
-I'm so healthy. -I know you are.
I protect Walter from anything, from everything.
So don't get too bitchy with him. Yes. [chuckles]
-No. No cookies for Runo. -No.
[Walter] It was a tsunami of art in Puerto Rico.
Everybody was thinking about art.
In the University of Puerto Rico, I began dancing classes.
I just have a passion for dancing.
Puerto Rico was a little island,
and I was living 100 years in advance.
But I was dancing, and also at the same time,
But I was dancing, and also at the same time, I was acting and having a lot of plays.
After that, I became an actor in television.
I did a lot of telenovelas.
[Willie] Walter was doing a play in Puerto Rico called
called El tríptico de amor, dolor y muerte.
Elin Ortiz had a show in Telemundo
and he invited Walter to do the promo for the play.
Walter was dressed like a Hindu prince
with a beautiful white cape, a lot of makeup,
and Elin Ortiz told him, "No, we'll do the promo later on,
but, Walter, let's talk about astrology.
You're always reading the palm of everybody around here,
and you're always asking, 'What's your sign?' and, 'What's your sign?' and, 'What's your sign?'
Let's talk about astrology."
I began to talk, but in a very improvised way,
I began to talk, but in a very improvised way, from my heart.
For 15 minutes, I was in a monologue.
"Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, the Moon.
Leo, you are the Sun. Virgo, Mercury.
Libra, Venus."
So... [gibbering]
Nobody expect that.
[Willie] When the segment finished, the general manager of Telemundo came downstairs running,
the general manager of Telemundo came downstairs running,
and said, "He has to do that show again tomorrow because people are calling."
"The telephone lines are full,
so I need to see you tomorrow, here,
so I need to see you tomorrow, here, doing the same show today.
I want Walter Mercado every day, 15 minutes a day in this show.
And I want you with the same costume tomorrow.
I want Walter in capes."
After three months, he started the one-hour show
of Walter, las estrellas y usted.
[in Spanish] And now the sign of Capricorn!
We have two paths, two human beings
and one important decision to make: make it.
You are beginning a cycle of good things: health, money, joy and love.
Have peace in your soul and love for everyone,
even for the unsufferable, for the critics and for religious fanatics.
Your whole life changes and you'll be happy.
Time will heal old wounds.
A change is coming, a move, a trip, something very favorable to you.
And it will be very fortunate. [continues indistinctly]
[in English] That show started August the 3rd, 1969.
And it became one of the top shows in Puerto Rico ever.
Let's go. Three, two...
I'm Bill Bakula.
I never wanted to be on the stage or in front of the camera.
I always wanted to be behind.
That was my... my passion.
I've known Walter
since I was a young man watching him on television.
So I was flipping through channels one night...
[Bill] You're flipping fast and you stop...
Saturn returns. [speaking Spanish] ...because you saw this guy dressed like...
in all opulence.
[Bill] Rings and jewelry.
He made you stop. He had the "stop" quality.
[Bill] All of a sudden, you're engaged.
And when he got to your sign,
you identified with it immediately. You said, "He's talking about me."
[Bill] So I made an appointment to get a consultation.
And it was incredible.
So I said, "Well...
is the consultation over?" He goes, "Yeah."
"Okay, now I wanna talk to you about something."
Under my arm, I had a bunch of storyboards.
And those storyboards basically depicted a new television show for him.
Something fresh with a higher production quality.
Two weeks later, we were taping his first show.
[Bill] We did 10 one-hour episodes, 48 minutes,
in a weekend.
And Walter was on point.
It was the first program on television that was wholly dedicated to astrology.
It was terrific.
It's kind of like a motivational speaker, you know,
that uses astrology to motivate people.
And people need motivation.
[in Spanish] Aquarius: You are a positive Aquarian.
Something important is that you're a go-getter.
You've broken barriers.
You've always loved creating, inventing, hustling.
You never freeze up.
[in English] In that moment, the people were hungry
to listen to some word of inspiration.
Maybe it was the right moment and the right occasion with the right people.
Everything was right.
According to the stars, it was perfect.
[Bill] Every talent needs somebody behind them.
I was the coach for one single purpose:
Walter's message to get out to as many people as possible.
[Walter] When I entered the world of astrology, it was a boom.
It was a boom! Really a boom.
Walter was doing television, he was doing radio.
[Tony Hernandez] He would record daily horoscopes.
And would break them out across morning drive time.
[Tony] It's easier to tell you about the markets Walter wasn't in than the markets Walter was in.
the markets Walter wasn't in than the markets Walter was in.
Probably about 150 radio stations carried his programming at his peak.
We started getting interest from places
We started getting interest from places that you never even imagined that there would be a Hispanic community.
[Bill] Next thing you know, Walter starts airing all throughout Latin America.
The next mission was Brazil. Second largest market after the US.
Then we jumped to Italy, Holland, the UK.
[Walter] Bill made me the most well-known psychic of this world,
the prophet of the new age.
Then I put everything I had, and everything I didn't have,
into crossing over into the general market in the US.
-[man] Wow. -[Howard Stern] Hey, Walter.
-How you doing? There he is. -[Robin Quivers] That's the outfit!
-[Howard] That's the outfit I see on TV. -[Robin] With the beads and everything.
[Bill] We got an invitation from Howard Stern.
[Howard] You're bigger than Jesus Christ.
-No. -[Howard] Oh, tell the truth.
-They treat me like Jesus. Like Buddha. -[Howard] Yes, see? Right.
[Bill] At first, I was hesitant about it.
But I knew that Howard was very much into yoga and Hinduism.
You know who was born on my birthday? -Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. -That's true.
-[Howard] That is correct. -At the same hour like you.
-[Howard] That is correct. -At the same hour like you. -[Howard] Yes. -[Robin] The same hour?
You are working from the navel down, and he was working from the navel up.
-[snickering] -[Robin] Oh! [Bill] Then he did Regis & Kathie Lee.
For him, I see a recuperation. A stress, he's having--
A recuperation? -For your heart. -Yes, for your heart.
-For your heart. -Yes, for your heart.
[Bill] Sally Jessy Raphael.
[Sally] A hundred-and-twenty million people
turn to this man for advice every day.
And all of a sudden, the general market started to get who this Walter was.
I predict that you're going to be the greatest comedian of the next millennium.
-He is! -[audience cheering]
[Bill] He landed a book deal with Time Warner. It was called Beyond the Horizon.
Before we knew it, we had really penetrated all of the Americas,
from Canada all the way to Tierra del Fuego.
There used to be this newscast called Primer Impacto on Univision.
And every day at 5:47 in the afternoon,
they would have the daily astrological forecast with Walter Mercado.
They didn't have the weather forecast, they had an astrological forecast.
[in Spanish] Walter is here to reveal the message of the stars.
I want you to know that the signs are divided into mutable, cardinal and fixed.
Pisces, you're mutable. You go with the flow.
[Maria Lopez Alvarez in English] We did it as a segment.
People love to hear their astrology. Now you'll get it on TV,
and we're gonna give it to you with none other than Walter Mercado.
And immediately it was a hit.
[Raul] For Primer Impacto at that time, he was a big asset.
I would say he was one of the biggest characters.
Not just with Spanish TV, anywhere.
December, the stars, and you. Aries, your higher mind pushing you to new attainments,
Aries, your higher mind pushing you to new attainments, to new heights.
Travel is okay.
I never dared to be traveling through the world,
or having 300 disciples in Brazil,
or 500 disciples in Colombia.
Bill opened many doors to me.
I met presidents, ambassadors, famous people.
Prime ministers, presidents from different countries,
came to Walter for private readings.
We saw his popularity just grow and grow and grow and grow.
[Bill] He couldn't walk on the street or there'd be a mob.
[reporter] Everywhere he goes, Walter Mercado is surrounded by legions of adoring, devoted fans.
Walter Mercado is surrounded by legions of adoring, devoted fans.
I've been waiting since nine o'clock in the morning.
I was in the eye of the eagle.
Hundreds of millions of people were watching his programs every day.
He almost became like a religion.
[Maria] We were doing a segment on Primer Impacto.
We put him in the headlines and said, "And Walter is with us live."
We had people swarming out of the building in 15 minutes.
People started wanting to touch him
like if he was holier than the Pope.
[Walter] Miami, New York, Panama, Colombia,
everywhere, everybody wants a piece of Walter.
Sometimes people say, "Walter you are very egocentric or narcissistic."
No matter how much money it costs, I always say, "You have to be radiant.
You have to be Walter."
Okay.
He has an augmented face that defies gender and maybe even age.
And his hair is a hybrid between
And his hair is a hybrid between really good male hair from the '70s
and really good, glamourous grandma hair.
[interviewer 2] Have you had any plastic surgery done?
Little arrangement.
A special Botox like Nicole Kidman.
I'm just like Dorian Gray.
My picture is growing old, but I'm growing young.
For every show, I have a special cape,
or robe.
Some are very heavy.
Some are lighter.
Some are hand-painted.
Each one has a story.
[Willie] He was the first person to use capes with beads,
[Willie] He was the first person to use capes with beads, and makeup, dyed hairs.
A lot of jewelry.
[Walter] This is from one of the best designers in Brazil.
Very humble.
[interviewer 1] Wait. The bracelet is very humble?
[Walter] Yes. You like it?
Many designers started doing capes for him.
Versace did something for him.
Isaac Mizrahi, Swarovski crystals,
sequins, rhinestone, pearls...
They cost a lot of money, but they were beautiful.
The message that Walter is bringing to you, he decorated.
[Walter] I am the picture, and the cape is the frame.
The cape covers me
The cape covers me and makes my image to go...
to the heart of my audience, of my people.
[Bill] He had his look, so did Elvis, so did Liberace,
so does the Pope.
If it doesn't look good, we're not even gonna listen.
[in Spanish] Thank you very much and don't miss Walter Mercado's outfit.
It's something like a pumpkin, a pumpkin about to smother him.
It's marvelous.
Night of magic and mystery,
night where anything is possible,
where those we loved and loved us, return to the earth
to seek out the warmth of heart and home, of love.
[Nydia Caro in English] Do you know anybody else that looks like Walter,
[Nydia Caro in English] Do you know anybody else that looks like Walter, or speaks like Walter, or dresses like Walter?
He's very much his own incredible creation.
He just broke the mold entirely.
[Karlo Karlo] People are mesmerized by the beauty of Walter,
by the glamor of Walter.
[Walter] I want to look beautiful. I want to look alluring.
I want to mesmerize people.
I study dancing, so I use my hands.
The people love all that kind of stupid things.
So, I used the stupid things to teach, to help, to serve,
So, I used the stupid things to teach, to help, to serve, to give a beautiful message of love and peace.
to give a beautiful message of love and peace.
[in Spanish] Love is the reason for everything.
Love is the beginning and the end.
Love is the reason to live.
He broke many boundaries.
His whole look: his capes, the layers, the fabulous costumes.
Now it doesn't seem that strange.
But when he did it, it was scandalous.
And he did it anyway.
How are you doing, little animals of creation?
On this occasion, -I'm anxiously awaiting today's guest. -[audience chuckling]
But he's had many problems because of the love of a woman.
In the '90s, they gave me my own show.
It was like a sketch show where I played different characters
and I immediately thought, "I have to do a Walter Mercado impression."
My impression has the same rings, capes, hair.
It's one of the most famous characters I have.
I think a big reason they love it is because it's based on Walter Mercado.
[Mireya in English] Walter was very beloved and very much an integrated part of the culture.
-[exclaims] -[laughing] [Mireya] But he would also get folded into gay jokes.
He was embraced and othered at the same time.
[in Spanish] Many of his imitations were meant to ridicule him.
He never liked being imitated.
You appear to be dressed a little bit like me.
Then don't do a bad imitation of me, because everybody does.
I would never wear those pants.
[Willie in English] When they see Walter and they make fun of him,
it's because they wish they could be like Walter. Yes.
-[in Spanish] What's your love sign? -[Walter] Scorpio, shut up...
He stings from behind!
And I sting from the front!
I'm like you, vice versa and versatile!
[Karlo Karlo in English] The Latino community was homophobic.
I mean, especially '70s, '80s... I mean, still nowadays,
but back then, it was, like, much stronger.
And perception of masculinity was so square.
Growing up as a queer boy and watching Walter Mercado...
gave me hope.
I saw Walter and I was like, "Okay, I'm not that different."
Here you have a man on television breaking all of these rules.
[woman in Portuguese] You have a very feminine look...
[in Spanish] As a kid, over the phone people would call me Miss.
It never bothers me.
"Who is this? Hello, Mrs.--" "No, it's a Mr."
It doesn't bother me.
[in English] He has a very feminine energy.
He's an androgyne. He looks like a woman.
Sometimes, he looks like a man.
The people that, you know, they said,
"Oh, that's a queer" or, "That's a faggot"... I don't care.
"Oh, that's a queer" or, "That's a faggot"... I don't care. He doesn't care.
Walter always takes a pill called an I-don't-care pill,
and I started drinking that pill, too.
And I use Vaseline so everything's slippery on my body. [chuckles]
Whatever they say...
I use Vaseline.
[Mireya] Somehow, inside a misogynistic, super-Catholic culture,
Walter could thrive.
We needed Walter in that landscape.
[in Spanish] Are you heterosexual or no?
Let me tell you something, I respect sex as something sacred.
For me, sex is spiritual.
I'm married to my public, to my people.
Walter is very protective about opening up,
including with his family.
I've seen journalists try to talk about his sexuality, his partners, his love affairs,
his sexuality, his partners, his love affairs,
and they're topics that he just won't touch.
[interviewer 2 in English] You don't talk about sexuality or your identity.
Why is that?
Because I have sexuality with the wind... with the wind,
with the flowers in the garden,
with all the beautiful display of nature.
I don't need a person. Especially to make me happy, to make me...
Especially to make me happy, to make me... to have an orgasmic experience, no.
to have an orgasmic experience, no. I have sex with life.
I have sex with everything.
With clothes, with beauty.
[Willie] People think that I'm his lover.
I don't know what they think. They think I have a relation with him.
And my relation with Walter is a very family relation.
I have never touched Walter with a finger.
Never in my life.
[Tony] I don't think Walter ever allowed himself to be defined through his sexuality.
It was none of your business.
He always sort of, you know, straddled that line very carefully.
[Karlo Karlo] If Walter Mercado would've come out in the '60s, '70s, '80s,
I think it would've hurt his career.
Puerto Ricans say often...
[in Spanish] "What you can see, you don't ask about."
[in English] And I know, like, visibility is very important.
But not coming out stopped, perhaps, the homophobia from running wild.
[Ivonne in Spanish] There are things that are just so ingrained
from your childhood, from your family,
that play on repeat in your mind.
It's difficult to change them.
[Karlo Karlo in English] There are so many societal laws that he broke,
it goes beyond coming out.
You use a cape because you're a superhero,
and I see Walter as a superhero.
[Ivonne in Spanish] In terms of his open secrets,
I don't think he confirms or denies anything.
[interviewer 2 in English] You're not telling me Walter Mercado is a virgin?
You're not telling me that you're a virgin?
-The only one in town. -[both laughing]
[interviewer 2] Yeah, the only one in town.
[in Spanish] Here I have a tarot deck,
a special deck on such a special day in such a special month.
In the month of love, ladies and gentlemen.
For you, Aquarius, I've pulled a card of strength. Because you're strong now.
No one knocks you down, no one destroys you, no one holds you back.
You're stronger than ever, Aquarius!
[Tony in English] I don't believe in these things.
That's just, sort of, my nature.
But I'll be honest with you, when you meet Walter,
But I'll be honest with you, when you meet Walter, and you have a chance to spend a little time with Walter,
you realize that there's something there.
Is that something divine? I don't know.
But it's quite unique, and I haven't... I haven't come across it with anyone else.
I haven't come across it with anyone else.
[in Spanish] All of these terrible predictions people make,
all of these cataclysms, tragedies, disasters coming with the arrival of the new millennium...
disasters coming with the arrival of the new millennium...
Nobody believe any of it.
Those who follow God, don't fear a thing.
[Willie in English] He planted in the mind of everybody faith, belief, believe you're gonna be great.
faith, belief, believe you're gonna be great.
You have to put faith.
If you don't have faith, you're never gonna get nothing.
[in Spanish] Virgo, what was once so ugly and sad, it all changes.
The waters will recede.
There will be a total change in your life.
So take advantage to realize
that which yesterday you didn't dare to do, Virgo!
[Bill in English] If you notice in all his content,
he never says anything negative.
Blessings.
[Bill] Never.
I think that's probably the key ingredient to his success and his ability to communicate.
to his success and his ability to communicate.
[in Spanish] Being a messenger of the Aquarian Age,
I bring you messages of light,
of love,
and of peace.
[Mauricio Zeilic in English] He would come out every day and he would tell you beautiful things,
and everybody wants to know if tomorrow's gonna be a better day.
[Nydia] He's like a warrior.
I think his message was and still is...
to live with as much love as you can in your life.
[in Spanish] Let's start by broaching
[in Spanish] Let's start by broaching the most controversial questions about Walter Mercado.
-[Walter] All my life. -Uh-huh.
Why do you mix so many different religions?
Not just, for example, Santeria, primitive religions,
Not just, for example, Santeria, primitive religions, with Christianity, Catholicism, but all of them?
You mix them all and you solve people's problems, why?
No one has a monopoly on God.
It's ridiculous to think so.
It can be Chango or Santa Barbara. Who cares what you call it?
[in English] I got the best from the Buddhism...
...the best from Hinduism...
Lord Ganesha. Om. ...the best from Christianity...
I mix with all kinds of astrology.
I realized that all religions have a point of convergence.
I call it interfaith religion.
You have to be nice to people,
you have to give the best of yourself every moment of your life,
and you have to believe in yourself.
[in Spanish] Taurus, be strong, really strong. Insist, don't give up!
Insist until you accomplish what you want. The cosmos will gift it to you.
[Tony in English] I think Walter appeals to the masses
because he's able to connect with something that's missing
because he's able to connect with something that's missing for a lot of us, particularly immigrants.
for a lot of us, particularly immigrants.
I think he gives us a sense of hope.
I think he gives people a reason to believe
perhaps that their lot in life may have a chance of improving, uh, in short order.
And if you listen to him and you sort of follow his guidelines,
it could be a road map towards a better and more fulfilled life.
[in Spanish] May God bless all of you, today, tomorrow and always.
[in English] My message is to give them the force inside themselves.
You can win. You can do that. Believe in yourself.
And that way, I'm helping people to be stronger.
[announcer] Have questions? Need answers?
Concerned about a loved one?
Need career or love advice?
Hi, I am Walter Mercado.
Thanks for making the Psychic Friends Network
the most popular psychic phone service in the entire world.
[Jody Vialy] In the early '90s, there were these 1-9-0-0 numbers,
and Walter's manager, Bill Bakula, decided to do that for Walter,
so that people could call in and connect to him.
You take calls on the Circle of Power line no matter where you are?
Yes. I love to be in touch with my people.
[Bill] We created a traditional 1-9-0-0 psychic hotline
to great success.
[Bill] We were the only ones in the Hispanic market in the US,
and we were the pioneers to go out of the US.
[in Spanish] I won $9,000 at Indian bingo.
Thank you, Walter. Thank you.
[in English] Actually, in Brazil, he's not really known as Walter Mercado,
he's known as Ligue Já, and that means "call now."
[Bill] Before we knew it, he had half a million subscribers and 4,000 psychics.
he had half a million subscribers and 4,000 psychics. Four thousand people answering phones.
My psychics, for me, I don't believe, I know,
are the best in the whole world.
All of them are natural psychics born with the gift.
The gift to help, to empower other people's life.
I knew that that was... baloney.
It could be my housekeeper answering the calls, you know,
and making 25 bucks a call.
[psychic over phone] I see the two of you will be married within two months of your baby's birth.
Married?
I never say, "You're going to win a lottery." Never.
Or, "You're going to have a husband in a week."
I never try to fool people. No, I never.
Only the International Psychic Society has predicted winning lotto numbers, family reunions and success story.
winning lotto numbers, family reunions and success story.
[interviewer 2] A lot of these hotlines were scams.
-Well... -[interviewer] Critics would say you were doing it to make money off of poor, desperate people.
But always they receive some kind of... uh...
words of inspiration or motivation.
[Maria] A lot of people were taking advantage of those 8-0-0 numbers,
and making millions.
Call me now for a free tarot reading.
And I can guarantee you Walter did not make millions on that.
Bill Bakula made millions on that.
Bill says, "Don't worry, these are up-and-up people.
Trust me, you'll be fine."
I'm not saying Walter was not in it for the money as well,
I'm not saying Walter was not in it for the money as well, but Walter was more innocent and naive about it.
[Jody] Walter was not about business.
So, it was important to Walter to know
that somebody was taking care of business for him,
so that he could concentrate on what he did best.
Walter expected only good things
and ran into a world of trouble that he never saw coming.
[Walter] Bill Bakula was my angel.
In one moment in my life, he was sent by God
to make me and my message of love understand and be known.
He was very smart. He was the master.
Walter had tremendous affection for Bill, and trust and love.
Bill became almost like a son, I would think, to him.
[Betty in Spanish] Bakula gave Walter very expensive gifts.
He would arrive at a hotel and he'd have a room totally lined with white roses.
[in English] Twenty bunches of roses.
Twenty, every day.
[Ivonne in Spanish] It was very extravagant.
[Walter in English] He would say, "Walter, you can't eat rice and beans.
No, you have to eat caviar and you have always the most exquisite food."
I had my own airplane. Everything was excellent.
I loved those things.
[in Spanish] Walter likes to please everyone. [Betty] Mmm-hmm.
So if you're kind to him,
he will try to please you.
[in English] I don't ever remember hearing Walter say no.
He's not that type of personality.
Inside, he's a little boy that just wants to be loved and respected.
Walter would do what Bill would ask him to do.
He was almost like, "Okay, if I have to do it, I have to do it. Okay!"
Okay.
-[in Spanishi] Here? -[in English] Okay.
Okay. Okay.
[in Spanish] "On my way!"
[in English] Okay, no problem.
[in Spanish] He had this power to bewitch him, to wrap him up in promises.
And Walter is so fanciful, he had him hook, line and sinker.
[Walter in English] One night I asked the lawyer to come to my house
and I said, "I have a contract for something quite important.
Read it very well."
And he said, "Okay, I will do it."
The next day, he say, "Sign it, it's perfect."
And I don't even read the contract.
[Maria] Walter just signed what he was asked to sign.
He didn't have someone really looking out for him.
The lawyer who reviewed it didn't really properly advise Walter
on the scope and nature of the contract.
So, Walter blindly signed the agreement.
[in Spanish] That's where the problems began.
[in English] They seemed to have a nice friendship, a good business relationship,
and so Walter trusted that what Bill Bakula was doing for him
was in his best interests.
[in Spanish] Remember that the artist is never a businessman.
An artist is always thinking about his art, how he's going to look,
how he's going to impress his audience that day.
[man in English] Five, four, three, two...
At that point, my communication with Walter ceased,
and Bill became my main contact.
For Bill, these things were transactional.
It was about, you know, how can I maximize revenue?
Walter was being advised by some of his family members,
who made him realize that there were some issues with the relationship.
When family gets involved in the businesses of an artist...
vey seldomly it works well for the artist.
He tried to sell all my old material.
He was recycling old horoscopes
and running it as if it was current.
It was not right.
I have to be very honest with my people.
But I couldn't stop him
because under the new contract, he had control of all materials.
[Carlos] The contract gave everything:
his name, his likeness, his image, to Bill Bakula.
Both parties were represented by competent attorneys.
Both parties understood the contract and he got paid.
He got paid according to the contract.
[Carlos] There was no timeframe for the agreement.
In other words, this thing would last forever.
There was very little room to even attempt to terminate the agreement.
It gave really no benefit to Walter.
[Walter] He's the owner of all my decisions, of everything in my life.
He owns my life.
And then he stopped paying. He stopped paying.
Wilma says, "We need the money. We need the money. And they are not sending the checks."
[in Spanish] Walter continued to record his program and comply with the contract,
[in Spanish] Walter continued to record his program and comply with the contract, but the money wouldn't come.
[Ivonne] So at that point, Walter cancelled the contract.
But Bill said the contract was for eternity.
[Walter in English] When I discovered that my contract
is so difficult to deal with,
I tried to repair and to talk to him to make a new contract and go on.
[Bill] We paid him to buy his business, not to rent it.
He sold his name. He sold his brand.
But there was a disagreement of how they viewed things
and the black letter on the contract.
So, we went to court.
Everything began to... [imitates crumbling noise] Yes.
Our claim for damages against Walter was just $1.
We didn't wanna hurt him economically,
we just wanted the world to know that we were right.
That's not true.
Actually, Bill Bakula was looking for Walter to pay
Actually, Bill Bakula was looking for Walter to pay about $14-$15 million in damages.
It was a nightmare of many problems, injunctions and...
It was a real nightmare.
At that point, Walter was not allowed to do anything
because Bill Bakula owned his image.
And so, unfortunately, we had to pull Walter from the show.
[Wilma] It was very shocking that, in the court,
[Wilma] It was very shocking that, in the court, they would give Walter's name to somebody else.
I've never seen anything like that happen in the world,
that you could give your name over to another person as a trademark.
When you try to explain to people,
"No, he lost the right to his name and he cannot be on TV,"
people, like me, couldn't understand that.
[Carlos] There was a pretty severe financial impact on Walter.
He was not receiving any funds.
He was really unable to transact any business during that period of time.
It was difficult for him.
We brought in our own lawsuit to do away with the agreement.
[Maria] I was asked to appear in court.
And they had Walter and Bill Bakula in the courtroom,
one on one side and one on the other side, and they were looking at me intently. [chuckles]
[Walter] It was like a fight between two forces.
This was a war. A war.
[in Spanish] In the first lawsuit, one part Bakula won
and another part Walter won,
so then we had to initiate another process.
So we stayed sort of in limbo.
[in English] He would have lawyers in Mexico, lawyers in Argentina,
lawyers in Puerto Rico, lawyers in Miami.
To be in a court fighting with the people that you love
is difficult for me.
And I had to face facts.
That was a difficult time, yes, very difficult.
It was hard, yes.
And Walter is very sensitive. He's a very sensitive person.
I've never regretted anything in my life.
Regret, that's out of the dictionary.
There are no regrets.
Ultimately, the jury determined
that Walter had interfered with those contracts,
but that there was no damage suffered by Bill Bakula.
So, Walter was returned all of his rights,
his name, his image, his likeness,
which is what Walter ultimately wanted.
It was a long, hard battle, and, um...
the consequences were severe for us, and for Walter, above all.
[in Spanish] Six years he fought.
Six lost years, during which he lost millions of dollars.
[in English] Emotionally, it affected him tremendously. I think... I think, eventually, it affected him physically.
I think... I think, eventually, it affected him physically.
I do believe Bill broke Walter's heart.
In the beginning, Bill was his angel,
and towards the end, Bill was his devil.
When I get to the hospital, Walter was dead.
There was no... no vital signs at all.
[in Spanish] I was clutching the Bible, praying to God.
[Willie in English] He has three arteries that were clogged.
[interviewer 2] Were you worried that this was the end?
Yes. Yes.
He was so tired of fighting.
He was tired of so many things, you know.
[in Spanish] Stress was the principle cause of the heart attack.
In Puerto Rico, there wasn't much help for him,
so he was moved from hospital to hospital.
[Betty] You see him fighting for his life.
We're going to do everything in our power.
Let's air lift him.
You don't know what's going to happen, you don't know if he'll make it alive.
[Ivonne] We arrived in Cleveland at five in the morning.
[Walter in English] My consciousness was coming and going.
It's a very strange feeling.
[in Spanish] I opened my eyes and I saw...
[in English] ...beautiful eyes, blue eyes,
blonde hair, a boy, a girl,
blonde hair, a boy, a girl, another boy, another girl.
And I said, "Oh, my God, they are angels. I must be in heaven!"
And Ivonne says, "Walter, wake up, you're not in heaven.
You're in Cleveland."
[in Spanish] He was in the hospital for a couple of weeks.
They put in stents and he started to recover.
Thank God, he recovered.
Walter has always been there for us.
At some point, he won't be here, physically.
I can't imagine life without him. At all.
[Ivonne] It's got to be a serious blow for him.
He would like to be present
on the TV and reach his audience again.
It has been a loss for him.
But he is very concerned about his image.
He wants to project fabulousness
because that has been the figure he's projected to the public
with his outfits, his sumptuous style.
And then not being able to do it with the same energy he's used to...
[Ivonne] It makes him very anxious because he wants
[Ivonne] It makes him very anxious because he wants to show his best face to his audience.
[Betty in Spanish] Sometimes he'll ask me,
"Do you believe in reincarnation?"
And, "What do you think about death?
What happens afterwards?"
[Walter] How depressing.
[Betty] As soon as we start talking and the conversation gets going,
he stops and doesn't want to talk anymore.
[Walter] Which side?
[Betty] He says he's eternal, that he'll live 120 years or more.
[Walter] Okay.
Walter, did you ever think you'd reach this level of fame?
No, I'm a Puerto Rican country boy.
And you never thought about making a movie of your life?
And you never thought about making a movie of your life? I don't want a movie yet.
Because people wait until you're dead to tell legends about you. I don't want legends!
to tell legends about you. I don't want legends!
I still have a lot of years left to live.
-To the theater! -[speaking Spanish]
[Walter in English] Look at that. It's beautiful.
[in Spanish] I did many productions here, many.
This is where I got the biggest applause of my life.
[in English] We play here a lot of dramas and comedies.
And the Ponce audience was terrific.
Pam-pam-pam-pam! It was very, very, very good. The atmosphere, the air, the energy's terrific.
The atmosphere, the air, the energy's terrific.
All the opening nights of all the ballets,
Midsummer Night's Dream,
La Sylphide.
I have a lot of memories.
I was a leader, breaking rules.
I'm breaking norms. I'm breaking forms. Yes, all my life.
[in English] It was a big theater.
It was so beautiful. It still is beautiful.
La Perla means a lot to me.
And to all the Ponceños.
Do you remember beautiful moments of your life?
But it was in the past.
I would like to do it tomorrow. [chuckles]
I would like to go on doing things.
Okay, let's walk.
[Lin-Manuel in Spanish] Thank you.
-[in English] This is very weird. -[laughing]
You know why it's weird? It's because he just lives in the TV.
I don't know anything about Walter Mercado
other than him telling me about my day and my life.
So it's like, we're gonna go inside the TV?
That's honestly how I feel right now. [laughs]
-[Walter] Boricua! -[Lin-Manuel] Boricua! [Walter] Welcome!
Take a good look at that beautiful man.
Best smile. Beautiful man.
[in Spanish] The honor is mine...
-[in English] This is crazy. -[all laughing]
[Lin-Manuel] If you talk to anyone my age, we grew up with him.
He is this iconic figure to us.
[Lin-Manuel] In retrospect, there was really nothing else like it on Spanish television.
He was like an oasis.
It's like gossip show, gossip show, gossip show... "Shut up! Walter Mercado's on." [chuckles]
The people in Puerto Rico love you so much.
[Lin-Manuel] They love you more.
They love you. They love you. We've always loved you.
This is very, uh... It feels very surreal.
I... I'm very emotional because...
[in Spanish] I grew up watching you with my grandmother. -We watched you every morning. -Oh!
I remember walking into the room and my grandmother saying...
-No, no, no, but... [shushing] -[laughs]
-"They're getting to Sagittarius!" -Capricornio.
-"They're getting to Sagittarius!" -Capricornio. -[all laughing] -Capricornio.
And later I would... [in English] So we'd sit there...
[in Spanish] And we would wait for Sagittarius and Capricorn.
[in English] He is this fabulous being unto himself in capes and makeup.
My cape.
I was three times in the Puerto Rican Parade.
[Lin-Manuel] Through Walter Mercado's existence,
we have a greater acceptance for people around us.
-[Willie speaking Spanish] -[Lin-Manuel] Oh, my God.
We love him without questioning anything.
And he has a great moral authority.
In that way, he's absolutely a pioneer.
It's gonna be weird when I wear this -instead of my Hamilton costume tomorrow. -[all laughing]
-[Walter] Take your natal chart with you. -[Lin-Manuel] Yes.
I want you to know that you have in me
a friend and an admirer.
[laughing] I'm gonna start crying.
-[Walter] You can't believe it? -I can't believe it.
-[Walter] You can't believe it? -I can't believe it. I can't believe what's happening. This is incredible.
-No, thanks to you. -[kisses] [in English] You're a light in our lives.
You are. [in Spanish] Incredible.
[in English] Millennials know perhaps maybe more about Walter Mercado than I do.
I've seen the memes.
Imagine there was, like, a 20-year-old right now
who was like, "I'm gonna read you your horoscope.
I'm nonbinary and asexual."
They'd be the biggest thing on Instagram.
[Ivonne in Spanish] There's a phenomenon that I can't explain.
We don't understand why
so many young people love and admire him
when they haven't been able to see him on TV in years.
[in English] Had the Liberace swag on a million. You know what I'm sayin'?
[in English] Had the Liberace swag on a million. You know what I'm sayin'? Look at that shit, bro. The cape game was immaculate.
Look at that shit, bro. The cape game was immaculate. Lookin' like my grandma's drapes.
He's so nostalgic. He represents moments where we're hanging out
He's so nostalgic. He represents moments where we're hanging out with our abuelitas, with our moms, with everybody.
with our abuelitas, with our moms, with everybody.
You could put him on a coin, you could put him on a T-shirt,
and we would all be like, "Oh, I know that."
Walter Mercado is from my family's hometown of Ponce, Puerto Rico. Eh!
So, I had instant appreciation for him.
You wanna go in there?
And here it is, the masterpiece itself.
Everybody takes pictures. I have to tell the men not to go into the ladies' room
I have to tell the men not to go into the ladies' room because everybody wants to see the bathrooms.
[interviewer 1] Do you believe in astrology?
Uh... I believe in Walter. I believe in anything Walter does and says.
[Bobby Gilardi] We have a cocktail named after Walter Mercado.
You get this, like, smoky floral note.
Kind of represents what is mysterious and enigmatic with Walter Mercado.
I'm happy to see that Walter Mercado is still relevant.
He is still an icon.
[Willie in Spanish] The HistoryMiami Museum has planned
to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of what was
The Walter Mercado Show
and your role in the world of astrology.
[Walter in English] It's a moment of celebration of my whole life.
I'm an ageless personality.
But according to the chronological time of the shows, it takes 50 years of fabulousness,
it takes 50 years of fabulousness, of excitement, of exoticism.
[Walter in Spanish] If we invite everyone in Miami who knows and loves me,
I will need to invite all of my jewelers, perfumers... everybody.
It will be a big scandal.
We're anticipating having about 200 guests.
We have on the list of guests
your friend, Julio... Julio Iglesias.
[in English] But also Gloria Estefan, Emilio...
[in Spanish] ...and their son, who are my good friends.
And "The Beast."
"The Beast" needs to be there.
[Ivonne] Who is "The Beast"?
[Walter in English] The most famous perfume dealer in...
-[Wilma] In Miami? -Yes.
-[Wilma] La bestia? -La bestia. He's terrific.
He's a beast in perfumes.
[photographer in Spanish] Beautiful!
[Ivonne] This photoshoot today is to promote
the exhibition at the HistoryMiami Museum.
[photographer] Show me some face...
That's what I love.
Beautiful!
And now, George, tell him to put his hands like this.
Do you want a little break? Let's take one.
Because that thing must weigh...
How much does one of those capes weigh?
They must weigh a lot.
Like 15 pounds.
Dude...
He has a pinched sciatic nerve,
and it's making the movements difficult for him.
I have some capes that are crazy heavy... but this one weighs like 15 or 20.
[Walter in English] To be on television, you have to be very well-dressed, prepared, planned.
It's work.
I demand too much of myself and it demands much energy.
And it's exhausting.
[Willie] Right now, he's suffering.
He has terrible pain. He hurt himself.
[in Spanish] He gets tired. He gets tired because of his age.
[Ivonne] He wants to keep doing a lot of things
that now aren't so realistic for him to do.
Let's do another.
-[Walter] One more? -Yes.
[Walter] That one weighs a ton...
and it's double.
[interviewer 2 in English] Would you describe this era of your life as being in "semi-retirement"?
No, never! I will never retire.
I'm going to die with my boots on. [snickers]
What are you saying, retire?
I will never retire.
I'm full of energy.
I'm 20 years old and I began a new journey in the life of a hero.
in the life of a hero.
Life is so short.
I'm Walter, a body. But more important than the body,
my spirit and my message is going to be eternal.
I was in the office and he called me on the phone.
And he said, "Please come, I fell down."
And apparently he got tangled up with sheets.
So when he got out of the bed, he fell.
Three of us went running and untangled him.
But then he went to take a bath and he slipped and he fell.
And Willie said he heard how hard he hit himself against the floor.
He had black and blues on his back.
[voice shaking] It's hard for all of us.
You know, we've never seen him like that.
[in Spanish] Take a look, Jesse.
Thank you, Jesse. Many thanks.
With all my heart, thank you.
You've made my life happy.
After we took him for tests and we saw those first X-rays,
uh... the diagnosis was that he had fractured a rib
uh... the diagnosis was that he had fractured a rib and part of the dorsal vertebrae of his spine.
In addition to the fracture he has on his pelvis.
I'm taking it easy, but it's driving me crazy.
Nothing scares me and nothing stops me, so...
Sometimes I'm in pain, sometimes I'm not.
Yesterday, I was in tremendous pain.
[Ivonne] Being in front of the cameras gives him energy.
Do you want more light? Less light?
[interviewer 1] It's okay how it is.
How do I look?
[in English] Not "okay." You have to check.
[in Spanish] Just like the cameras and the filming and the lights gives him energy,
his public gives him even more.
[Ivonne] Even though he has a fracture and even though he's in pain,
he's definitely going to go to the event in Miami.
He's going to be there.
[in English] Oh, my goodness.
[man] Hi, Walter. How are you?
[in English] This is our second home. Miami.
-[in Spanish] How does the song go? -What?
"And you, and you, and you..."
It's like, "May the skies..."
♪ I care about you And you and you ♪
♪ And no one else but you And you and you ♪
♪ I care about you And you and you ♪
♪ And no one else but you... ♪
[Willie] Who's coming now? Who's coming?
-[woman] Right now, Primer Impacto. -[Willie] Primer Impacto.
Okay.
[host] Look how privileged we are, ladies and gentlemen,
to be with Walter Mercado today.
[in English] I'm here with Walter Mercado. I don't need to introduce him.
I would like to ask you about this incredible exhibit.
[in Spanish] It's been 50 years in front of the lens.
What does it mean to you, to share with your public?
It's so they get a little of the flavor...
and the fragrance, the essence of Walter Mercado.
[in English] Walter is not only the cape, or the hair, or what they think.
[in Spanish] Walter Mercado is a force of nature.
Would you return to Primer Impacto, Walter?
I don't know because some things belong to their era.
[host] You were an actor, a singer, a dancer...
Keep going, keep going, it's all true.
What is your message to Hispanics?
That every day we should be more united, more heart.
Diversity makes us stronger.
[clears throat] It's a shame that I woke up without a voice.
I don't know why, but I have many ailments.
I have sciatica, too, but I told myself, "You can't ever miss Jorge Ramos!"
But then one says to oneself, "You have to be healthy first in order to get sick."
In other words, you're doing well? Of course I'm well!
-And with tremendous energy. -I know.
Can I say your age? 87?
-No! No! -[laughing]
[Walter] Between 50 and death, and that's it.
That seems extraordinary to me.
[Jorge in English] So, let me ask you... I am agnostic.
When we die,
I don't know what's gonna happen.
That's good. You will have surprises.
[Jorge] I hope that we have surprises.
And I hope that I'm wrong.
When we die,
what happens, Walter?
The body, which is just a house or a cage,
you begin from earth, to return to earth.
You are just atoms and molecules, but there is inside you
something eternal, immortal.
[Jorge] Eternal?
So you think that we'll be there without our body?
Yes, until you are reincarnated.
Because I believe...
Not believe. I know that there is reincarnation.
[in Spanish] Are you going to die in Puerto Rico?
-Wherever they catch me. -[both laugh]
It's that death doesn't worry me that much.
Really?
It's a topic I don't like to broach because
we all know we're going to die someday.
The day you're born they mark a document saying you'll die someday.
Is there someone? A god?
Who tells us what is going to happen?
God is in there, God is in here.
The God that is in me... [kisses]
salutes the God that is in you.
The Namaste.
You know I can't end the interview
without asking you to do your "with lots of love" thing.
May God bless all of you, even though he doesn't believe in God...
May God bless all of you...
today, tomorrow and always.
And may you receive from me always...
a lot of peace.
But above all, what?
A lot, a lot, a lot, a lot... of love.
[Walter in English] I'm in the front page.
Look at that.
My capes in the museum.
I'm happy tonight.
I'm flabbergasted.
I'm bombarded with many beautiful words.
Everybody's talking about tonight.
And I have all my family here.
[Walter in Spanish] What do you think? Is it too big?
[in English] A little big?
[woman in Spanish] Very humble. It's very you.
[in English] When I wake up in the morning, it's the first morning of my life.
Today is my day.
Today, I'm going to be the best version of Walter.
Life is a constant reinvention.
I never rehearse to be myself.
[interviewer 1] Are you ready for your close-up?
I'm ready... [clearing throat]
I'm ready... [clearing throat]
I'm ready for my close-up.
[in Spanish] Don't film my chair.
[in English] Don't shoot.
Only the upper part of the body.
[in Spanish] This way, Walter.
[in English] I've never been in the same room with Walter. I look forward to that. We're all here for him.
I look forward to that. We're all here for him.
[in Spanish] It's hot. I'm telling you it's a little hot.
It's hot.
-There's no more room for people? -What?
-There's no more room for people? -What? There's no more space?
No, no more space. They're not letting more people in.
[in English] This just in. We are dying of heat waiting for Walter Mercado.
Music's playing...
[in Spanish] ...but he's nowhere to be found.
[in English] Haven't seen him. We're super fangirling.
[in Spanish] The homage to Walter is about to begin.
I don't know. I don't know what's going to happen.
I feel emotional and happy.
[in English] I don't know what his energy level will be right now,
but we're super excited.
[both] So excited.
Ah! My God. [laughs]
[woman] You have to sit on the throne now.
[in Spanish] But they have to do the dance first and all that.
-[man] But he has to be seated already. -I know.
Now? Should I get on it?
[woman in English] Okay, Walter, let's go.
[man] I know that I look really calm,
but I'm about to freak out because...
I watched when I was a kid. I love you.
[in Spanish] I love your vest!
-You like it? -I love it!
I follow you from Spain.
Wow!
Like a good Cancer, I always listened to you.
[in English] You're so beautiful!
[in Spanish] Thank you... I'm a Scorpio.
[in English] Okay, next.
[in Spanish] Bless them for me please, for the photo.
[Walter] For me...
it was the most beautiful and memorable moment of my life.
-[rain pattering] -[Walter exclaims]
Look at that!
My God...
What good publicity!
It's all beautiful... my hair... It's all beautiful.
[in English] Beautiful.
[in Spanish] Look at this one. How beautiful.
Look at the photo of my family when I was a child.
Oh, my God.
-I don't think I'm in this one, Willie. -Where?
-I don't think I'm in this one, Willie. -Where? Over there.
-This one is you. -No. I don't believe it.
This is Cuca, Henry, your dad and your mom.
-How depressing. -Oh, please...
[Walter] How depressing.
[in English] I'm a fortune teller, but I don't like to know my future.
I just want to enjoy each moment of my life.
[in Spanish] Look, look!
Look at that!
I was very cute, wasn't I?
Yes.
[in English] I feel that I'm in heaven right now, living the life I'm choosing to live
and with the people that I love. That's heaven for me.
I don't expect another heaven.
Heaven is today and heaven is now.
[in Spanish] That's precious!
[Willie in English] Walter will never...
He will never leave.
This will leave, yes.
This is a carapacho. This is, uh... This is nothing.
[Walter singing] ♪ If you go away ♪

[Willie] When he passes away, the essence of Walter will live forever and ever

[Walter] Walter Mercado is a force of nature without beginnings and endings.
He used to be a star, but now,
Walter is a constellation.
[in Spanish] God bless you all today, tomorrow, and forever.

It's 9:00 a.m. We're running late, Dad!
-Sister, serve me the parathas. -Coming right up!
Don't stuff yourself with food. Get a grip!
Mom, he tends to throw up in the bus.
Let him eat to his heart's content.
-Heer, bring it already! -Be right there!
Go on.
-Here you go. -Have it.
Give me one. You're not getting any more parathas!
-Hey! -Why? What's the matter, my beloved wife?
Just give me half a paratha.
You've had enough. Now get ready and go to the shop.
-Look, Prab is here. -Prab is here!
Please come back home early today, you two.
Heer has invited the locality kids over.
We'll cut the cake at 6:00 p.m. sharp. The weather gets colder after that.
Dad, when will you leave from work?
Well, it's my retirement day.
I just have to sign the register and give a little speech.
The employees will distribute sweets and give me gifts.
It will barely take two hours.
That calls for a double celebration.
What do you say, Dad? Would you like a little...
Please keep quiet! I know what you're talking about!
Don't be silly! I'm talking about Nagpal's lassi.
"Would you like a little..."
Mom, the parathas you made are absolutely delicious.
Really?
Bring a really big gift for Prab today on your way home.
Bigger than Prab?
You eat way too much for your age. Here, eat some more.
Would you like some curd? Here you go.
Well, alright then.
You may as well give me some pickle, Uncle Jogi.
Alright, you've eaten enough. I'm done too. I'm full.
-Hold him. -Jogi, finish your breakfast!
-Come on, hurry up. -Don't leave on an empty stomach.
Eat something. Oh, God!
Here's my dress and this is my jewelry.
-I'm going to wear this. -Jogi, be there on time.
-It was different the last time. -Alright. I'm running late.
This is the one.
-Greetings, Jogi! -Greetings!
-Hurry up, Mom. -Greetings, Sister.
-Greetings, Jogi. -Come on.
Here you go.
Jogi, be there on time. You are going to blow up all the balloons.
-Come on. -Bye, Uncle Jogi.
Father, I'll drop them home and go to the shop.
-Come on! -Get on the scooter, kiddo!
Come on.
Go on. God bless you.
-Bye, Jogi. -Bye!
Hi, Jogi. What's up?
What's up with you two? Don't you have school?
-Jogi, say "pencil". -Pencil.
-School's canceled! -School's canceled!
We are waiting to celebrate Prab's birthday in the evening.
Ginny, Sunny!
Stop roaming around. Don't you have homework to do?
You're always wasting your time!
Get back inside. Come on.
Don't forget our return gifts.
Make sure you arrive on time because you're going to blow up all the balloons.
-Let's go, Dad. -Come on.
In a shocking incident,
the prime minister of the country has been shot by her two bodyguards.
The two are believed to be from the Sikh community.
Common perception among people...
is that this assassination came in response to the invasion
of the Holy Sikh Temple in Amritsar this June...
DHAULA KUAN
Hey, stop!
Come on, stop!
Look, Dad. The bus is almost empty.
Didn't I tell you we'd find a seat?
You worry unnecessarily! You said we wouldn't find a seat.
We've got a seat.
You're an eminent resident of this locality, right?
-You're the first one to get all the news. -I sure am.
Sir, two tickets to ITO.
Why are you gawking at me? I said, two tickets to ITO.
Stop the bus and ask them to get down!
Why would we get down? Do you own this bus?
Get out of here, you terrorist!
-What do you mean? -What are you doing?
-Why are you doing this? -How dare you call me a terrorist!
What are you doing?!
-You... -Why are you hitting us?
We won't spare your life!
You killed our mother!
-What are you even saying? -Yes!
How have we wronged you?
You have wronged us by being a Sikh!
-Let go! -Throw them out!
Let go of us!
The nation is in shock.
The nation is in shock. And a wave of mourning is visible through the country.
And a wave of mourning is visible through the country.
We regret to announce that the Prime Minister of the country...
We regret to announce that the Prime Minister of the country... has been shot dead.
She was immediately rushed to All India Medical Institute...
where she was succumbed to her wounds.
Yes, tell me.
Really?
What about Trilokpuri?
And what about Shalimar Bagh?
Just two?
Listen to me.
I need the voter list.
Each and every name should be marked. I'm on my way.
There's nothing to be scared of. Everyone's with us.
BHATTI GENERAL STORE
What's the matter? Hey!
Hey! Stop it!
Get him!
Hey! Get away from me!
-Go away! -Burn down the shop!
Please leave me!
For God's sake, leave me!
Hey! Stop it!
Hey, you-- Don't shut it!
Don't lock me in here! Let me out!
Please let me out!
Please let me out!
-For God's sake! -Burn it down!
After the assassination of the Prime Minister of the country,
many pockets in Delhi have seen incidents...
Save me! Please help!
Please save me!
Oh, my God!
Please save me!
Save me!
Please help!
Get out of here! Run for your lives!
Run!
-Dad, go home. I'll be there. -Jogi! -Please take care! -Come on.
-Please take care! -Come on.
Kill them all!
There they are!
-I told you to not go from here. -Dad, what's happening?
Hey, stop!
-What are they doing? -Why are you attacking us?
-Dad! -Stop! There's a kid in the car!
No! No!
Brother, you should get out of here.
Take care of your father.
No. I'm not going anywhere.
-Go! -Hang in there. You'll be fine.
-I'll be fine. Please go. -Everything will be alright.
Go.
Hang in there.
Satnam...
Waheguru.
Open the door!
Open the door! Open the door, or else we'll break it down!
Spill the kerosene!
Burn down the place! Burn him alive!
-Burn it down! -Show yourself, Sardar!
-You terrorist! -Get out of there!
Show yourself!
Reports from many parts of the capital have also stated
that shops owned by people of the Sikh community
have also been looted and burnt.
Dad!
Mom!
Sukhi!
Mom, no!
Mom, please!
Mom!
Mom!
Why are you cutting my hair?
Keep quiet!
Sister! What are you doing?
Jogi, you should leave!
Please go away, Jogi. We are all leaving.
-Have you seen my family? -We don't know where they are, Jogi.
Delhi is in shambles!
They are burning down the city. You should leave, Jogi!
Mom!
You too should find your family and go away for good, Jogi.
Mom!
Mom, why are you cutting my hair?
Mom...
Heer!
Uncle Jogi, they killed my dad.
Tajinder...
They burnt down Tajinder's shop in the market.
He was in there!
Heer...
Jogi, don't disturb me.
I need to stitch this shirt for him for the evening.
Before he left, he specifically told me
that he'd wear a new shirt for Prab's birthday party in the evening.
Heer... put this away.
Heer...
Heer!
Heer...
Sir!
-The situation is worsening, Kuldeep. -Yes.
-Get me some biryani. -Sure.
-Mutton biryani. -Yes, sir.
TRILOKPURI POLICE STATION, EAST DELHI
There's just 20 of them?
I was expecting more.
This mutton biryani has been made with basmati rice.
This is not a langar.
If you want to work, then listen to me closely.
I hope you are aware of what's going on.
Well, I may not be well-educated.
But there's one scientific truth that I know.
For every action...
there is an equal and opposite reaction.
The action is done.
Now, it's time for your reaction.
Didn't you understand?
That's alright. You dumbfucks need not understand.
Look, here's the deal.
It's a thousand rupees for one Sikh.
And if it's an eminent Sikh, then it's 5000 rupees.
It's like a lottery jackpot. Rack up as much as you can.
Swords, country-made pistols, kerosene.
-Give them whatever they need. -Consider it done.
It's the higher authority's order.
There won't be a shortage of supplies. So, go nuts.
And as an added bonus, you can keep all the loot.
Get to work.
-Ram Manohar. -Yes?
-Get them out of here from the rear exit. -Okay.
Make sure none of their faces is visible.
Come on.
Now listen up, you two.
The country is grieving.
All the emergency services are shut.
If a Sikh calls you up for help in the next three days,
make sure you don't answer.
Kuldeep, I suggest that you put the phone's receiver aside.
How are you gonna answer it if it doesn't ring?
Sir...
the convicts we're setting free are really dangerous.
Inspector Chautala, the stunt that they pulled off
was dangerous as well.
So, just do what you have been asked to.
This is the voter list.
There's an "S" written in front of every Sikh's name.
Distribute these.
It's your responsibility to deal with the Sikhs
whose names are on this list.
You will be rewarded if you diligently perform your duties.
Also, the police station and the basement lockup should remain empty
Also, the police station and the basement lockup should remain empty until I tell you otherwise.
Now, get to work.
Come on, Kuldeep.
TRILOKPURI LANE NO. 6
HARPAL SINGH HARINDER KAUR
JOGINDER SINGH
Jogi!
Jogi!
Jogi!
Heer!
Tajinder!
Jogi, the whole of Janakpuri has been burnt down.
They've even burnt down two gurdwaras, let alone houses!
We must fight to protect ourselves.
Are you out of your mind, Jogi? What do you mean?
We're ordinary working men...
not goons.
What else should we do, Sukhi?
Wait for them to kill us?
What have we even done?
The nation has turned against us in the last eight hours!
We have no choice but to fight for ourselves.
-Daler, how many men do we have? -Approximately one hundred.
Listen closely. That is the main entrance.
Have three men posted here, four over here and four at this end.
-Alright, Jogi. -If anybody finds anything suspicious,
give us a sign.
Sukhi, it's your responsibility to look after women and kids.
Jogi!
Jogi, it's me, Rawinder!
Rawinder?
Jogi?
Jogi!
Jogi, open the door!
Jogi!
Jogi!
Open the door, Jogi!
What are you doing here?
I came here looking for you.
Open the door and let me in.
Who else is with you?
Have you lost your mind? How can you doubt me?
They burnt my brother-in-law Tajinder alive inside his own shop.
The whole of Delhi is going to burn.
Listen to me.
Get all your family members and sit in my car.
In these circumstances, Punjab will be the safest place for you people.
I'll drive you to Mohali in four hours.
What about the others?
Look...
it's the higher authority's order.
Take a look at this voter list.
No one's gonna stop them for the next three days.
All the names that have been marked with an "S" will get killed.
What would you have done if you were in my place?
Would you just bail on your people?
Please don't be stupid.
This is not the time to be emotional.
Think about your family.
Think about your family?!
You know my neighbor Gurvinder, right?
He chopped off his elder son's hair.
He dressed his younger son as a girl before leaving the house.
They were all burnt alive at Ghantaghar.
And many of those who burnt them...
were Gurvinder's childhood friends.
They are all my family.
I'm not abandoning them.
Alright then.
Let's take everyone along.
-How dare you call me a terrorist! -Why are you doing this?
We won't spare your life!
How have we wronged you?
You have wronged us by being a Sikh!
Let go!
Satnam...
Waheguru.
The whole of Delhi has been burnt down!
Mom, why are you cutting my hair?
Let's drive to the baoli.
May Waheguru bestow His blessings...
upon one and all.
I didn't have a choice, Mom.
Mom...
Jogi has made a big sacrifice to protect and save our lives.
Making a sacrifice isn't a sin.
It only brings us humans closer to the Almighty.
-Forgive me, Mom. -No, my child...
People who make mistakes are supposed to be forgiven.
You have made a sacrifice, son. Don't seek forgiveness.
May God bless you, son.
May you live a long life...
KALEEM ANSARI
How may I help you?
Are you out of your mind, Jogi? What have you done?
Rawinder, you should have stopped him!
How?
We forced him to do it.
Kaleem...
your truck could get burnt.
Three trucks have already been burnt.
Just take your people to Mohali safe and sound.
-How long will it take? -I need two hours to set things up.
I've split the truck into two compartments.
The upper one will have cudgels and swords, and people can hide below it.
I got this small window built.
If you need to communicate with them, you can open it like this.
Bring everyone here while I get the truck ready.
-Come on. -Just the elders and kids come ahead!
-Just the elders and kids! -Don't rush!
-Don't rush! Be patient. -Easy. Come on!
Please don't push each other. Everyone will get a chance!
-Come on in. Careful. -Wait!
-Come on. -Easy, everyone!
Sukhi!
-Wait! What happened? -Careful.
-Be careful. -Prab!
Come on. Let's get you in.
-Come on. -Please take my child!
My baby is small. Please let my wife go with him. I'll come later.
-Please get in, ma'am. -Go on. Get inside.
Calm down. It's okay.
Please wait! I request you all to be patient!
-Jogi! Jogi! -Listen, Jogi!
Please send Heer with us.
-Please. -Please let Heer go with us.
It's just the elders and kids this time. I'll bring Heer with me the next time.
-You please get in. Take care of Prab. -Prab, go with your grandmother.
-Easy! -Come on, Prab.
-Please come. Dad, come on. -Prab get in. -It's okay, son. -Please get in.
-It's okay, son. -Please get in.
Please come ahead, Uncle.
Listen. Make sure that the truck follows my jeep.
No one will stop a police vehicle. Okay?
The truck is now full!
Please keep calm! All of you will get a chance in the next round!
Shut the doors, Sukhi!
Lock the doors.
Please get inside!
Get in.
The truck is ready.
The remaining people in the gurdwara are your responsibility.
Please take care.
You too.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Careful.
Give me that.
We'll be fine, my child.
Fuel up the truck at the first petrol pump that you come across.
Take care.
You too.
Jogi!
Go on.
Sir, please fuel up the truck.
Have you lost your mind?
Your stupid campfire could burn the place down!
Sir, that would happen if there was any fuel here.
There's not an ounce of fuel here.
Why? What happened?
You won't get any fuel anywhere.
They have taken all the fuel to the warehouse.
-The warehouse? -Yes.
Let's go to the warehouse.
We can't go there, Jogi.
If we go there, we'll get killed.
That's Tejpal's supply farm.
It is the source of supplies for the riots happening in East Delhi.
Do we have a choice?
SUPPLY FARM GEETA COLONY
Jogi, could you please get a glass of milk for my baby?
He hasn't eaten anything since morning.
I'll try.
Calm down. Jogi will handle it.
They are going to destroy Delhi.
-What is your name? -Rawinder Chautala.
-Police station? -Trilokpuri.
How many men and weapons do you need?
We just need diesel.
We loaded the truck with weapons, and it occurred to me that we're out of diesel.
Well, that's okay.
Working the night shift often tends to drive you crazy.
Listen! Give me about seven to eight extra canisters of diesel as well.
I'll give you ten. There's no harm in keeping a few extra canisters. There shouldn't be a shortage.
There's no harm in keeping a few extra canisters. There shouldn't be a shortage.
Sir...
can I get a glass of milk?
Silly man!
What you're asking for is called booze here. Do you understand?
I've been wondering why the two of you didn't ask for alcohol
along with the other supplies!
No, I just want milk.
You see, tea helps me stay awake at night.
Tejpal is rather strange!
He doesn't even consider a man's age before hiring him for a job. Unbelievable!
He wants milk!
Go and check if we have any milk.
Who's the owner of this truck?
Hey, find the driver of this truck!
Go near the truck. I'll wait here.
Get this truck out of the way!
Whose truck is this?
Is two multiplied by two three, my child?
Write four.
-Greetings, sir! -Greetings!
I'm speaking from store number two.
Rawinder Chautala from Trilokpuri Police Station wants diesel.
Go ahead. He's our guy. He's on duty.
-Alright, sir. -Hey, listen!
Put him on the phone.
Hey, you!
Is that truck yours?
Yes.
Here's a bottle of milk for you.
Finding milk for you was a task!
Thank you, sir.
I thought you wouldn't have any milk.
-Did you fuel up the truck? -Yes, I did.
Brother...
Give me that.
Here you go. Feed him.
Yes, sir?
What are you going to do with all that diesel, Rawinder?
Well, sir, I was running short of diesel.
Did you pass exams in school by sucking up to your teachers?
I don't understand, sir.
You see, your answer sheet is blank. How can I give you a grade?
You haven't ticked a single name off the list.
Sucking up to me won't help you.
Listen, Rawinder.
I didn't expect this from you.
This is boring.
Tick as many names as you can off your list by tomorrow morning.
What are you doing, man?
Nothing. I was just loading a few extra canisters.
Where's the milk?
Give me that bottle.
I drank it.
Did you swallow the bottle as well?
-Hurry up. -Hang on.
Give me back my bottle.
Give it to him.
How could I swallow a glass bottle?
I threw it away.
You two assholes are certainly up to something devious.
Let's go.
Do it.
Look, Uncle Kuldeep is here.
Go and ask your mom to make some tea.
-And please complete your homework. -Yes, Dad.
Sir, this is Lali Katiyal.
He called up and said that he wants to meet Tejpal Singh.
Really? Why?
He says he has some information he wants to give directly to you.
Tell me, Katiyal.
What information do you have?
Sir...
the whole of Delhi will burn,
but lane number six will remain unaffected.
Why?
Hey, make him quiet.
Hey, open the gate.
How can I just let you go? You've been called inside.
It's Mr. Tejpal on the phone.
He wants to speak with you.
Yes, sir?
Listen to me closely.
Lane number six, 30 feet road, behind the playground, Trilokpuri.
Raze it to the ground.
What happened?
Why won't you say anything?
You should thank me for giving you this lead.
There are about a hundred Sikhs there.
Yes, sir.
And here's another thing.
The army has been given instructions.
They will take control of the city very soon.
Make sure you wipe off lane number six before that happens...
and report to me.
Yes, sir.
We have to burn down lane number six.
Are you out of your mind?
You're asking us to burn down our houses!
Are you working for Tejpal?
-Jogi! -Jogi, please calm down!
Don't be emotional about it!
He has given me an order.
If I refuse, he will outright suspect that I'm helping you people out.
-You scoundrel! Tell me the truth! -Jogi... Jogi!
Rawinder is right.
I'll stay here and hide the truck somewhere.
You two should go.
Go and burn down all our houses.
Jogi...
Son, we are used to this.
We will rise from the ashes.
Go on.
Go, my child.
O Almighty!
You are our only savior
You are our only hope
Oh, merciful Lord!
You are the light
That guides us through darkness
I have devoted my life to You
You are the one
You open rivers on the barren heights
Burn all my vices, Lord!

Open the gate.
Sir, you can go ahead,
but the truck needs a chalan to pass.
Well, that's okay. Sign a chalan.
Sir, I won't sign the chalan. My boss will.
KARNAL TOLL TAX OCTROI
-Sir. -Yes?
This is a chalan for their truck. Please sign it.
Did you check the truck?
Sir, how can I check a police inspector's truck?
Don't you know that the orders are from the higher authority?
His superiors have clearly instructed us
to not let any truck pass without a thorough check.
A truck has been seized in UP.
They built a hideout in the lower part of the truck and there were people inside it.
Unload their truck.
Sir, what's in the truck?
Just weapons. You may check.
There are about eight canisters of diesel in the jeep...
and there are weapons in the truck.
That's a boatload of weapons!
That's alright. It shouldn't take very long.
We'll just unload the truck and check.
Come on.
What... Do you intend to burn the whole of Karnal?
Hey, stop right there! Why are you in a hurry?
Hey, stop right there! Why are you in a hurry? Open that.
We need to check inside.
Go on. Unload the goods.
Don't just stand there. Give him a hand.
Come on.
Hurry up!
Be quick!
What all are you carrying around?
Climb up the truck and unload the goods!
Hurry up, man!
This is ridiculous!
Keep going! Take the sacks off the truck!
What's underneath that rag?
Hey, lift that rug off that thing!
Hurry up!
What is that? Open it!
What the hell?
Hey! Sir, they have built a hideout!
Where the hell are you taking them? -I told you they were-- -Hey, shut up! Step back!
-I told you they were-- -Hey, shut up! Step back!
Hey, you! Get off the truck!
Get down.
Hey, shut the compartment!
Do it!
Tell me, what are you up to?
No!
Leave me!
You scoundrel...
Behind...
look behind...
Run! Quick!
-Hello? -Yes?
I'm speaking from Karnal Tollbooth.
A policeman broke through the barricade and got away with a truck.
He broke through the barricade!
Who was the policeman?
We don't know, sir. There were two people.
They had a truck full of Sikhs.
Did you note down the vehicle number?
-Yes, sir. I did. -Why didn't you get hold of them?
How could I? They fired at me!
Bring him over tomorrow.
Come on.
Jogi... please don't forget about Heer.
Do whatever it takes to bring her here.
Do you understand?
Don't worry, Mom.
Take care, okay?
You too take care of yourself.
Violence has erupted after the assassination
of the Prime Minister of the country.
Scores of cars belonging to people of Sikh community have been burnt.

Several hundreds of taxi drivers in Delhi are from the Sikh community as well...
You stepped on the line!
Give me that. It's my turn now.
When will my school reopen?
It will reopen in a day or two, my dear.
Dad, you also stepped on the line!
I'm tired.
Take this.
Go inside and ask your mom to make some lemonade for everyone.
Okay, Dad.
Trilokpuri, Shahadara, Mongolpuri, Nand Nagri and Geeta Colony.
Your work is done. Here's the list.
What about lane number six?
What's up with you, Chautala?
What's wrong with your face?
You don't seem to be enjoying your job.
No, sir. I have got an excellent report.
Last night, I burned down lane number six.
Really?
Out of a hundred people, only three corpses have been found.
Yes, sir. I was stunned to see how eerily silent the place was.
I think everyone fled from there.
Those who were left behind were burnt alive.
Did they flee or did someone help them escape?
Sir...
The dead bodies were from lane number 22.
They were placed in lane number six.
And then, they were burnt.
Sir, I'm well aware of my duties.
Please tell Lali that I take orders only from my seniors.
Look, Rawinder.
I have worked my ass off to reach where I am today.
I was a mere worker when I had joined the party.
And today, I'm in a position where the party is willing to give me a ticket.
But you're getting in the way of me acquiring a ticket.
Do you know when a man accepts someone as their own?
It happens when someone helps him in times of need and makes him feel
It happens when someone helps him in times of need and makes him feel indebted to that person.
Do you understand?
I'm sure you understand.
I know for a fact that you are shrewd.
Lali, what is the name of the leader of lane number six?
Joginder.
He's fondly known as Jogi.
Jogi.
Look, Rawinder, I don't want anything.
I can even take some workload off your shoulders.
All I need you to do is... kill Jogi.
You know that the whole of Delhi is burning.
People's houses are burning.
And you never know... yours might burn as well.
You have a family, right? A wife? Kids?
Won't you shake hands with me?
What are you doing, Lali?
Jogi is my friend.
He might be your friend, but he's my enemy.
And I won't spare him this time.
Try all you want.
But if you lay a finger on Jogi or his family members,
I will shoot you.
DLC 2321.
I know what the two of you are up to.
I'm just doing my job, Lali.
And I do it in honor of my uniform.
What are you doing?
The entire department has become subservient to Tejpal!
Listen!
Remember one thing.
I'll be standing between you and Jogi in my uniform.
Sir, is everything alright?
It will be alright, Ram Manohar.
Do one thing.
I want all our men -to completely seal Trilokpuri. -Yes, sir.
-to completely seal Trilokpuri. -Yes, sir.
Let us wait and see
if the Sikhs from lane number six manage to escape.
Yes, sir.
Jogi, why don't you understand?
He knows the truck's number!
We can't use this truck to get people out of here.
He has barricaded the whole of lane number six.
He wants to take his revenge in the pretext of obeying commands!
So, let's go to Lali and end this once and for all!
-Jogi! -Are you insane?
Are you completely out of your mind? Why don't you understand?
He can track us down with his men like a bloodhound!
And all the people in there will die!
-How dare you talk to me like that! -Hey!
-What do you mean? -Why are you talking to me like that?
I had warned you earlier to just think about your family and yourself!
I told you to take my jeep and escape!
But you wanted to be a hero!
-Stop talking nonsense, you two! -We have already spoken about this!
We have spoken about this, but do you know what Tejpal told me today?
He threatened me!
He said he would kill my family if I help you people escape.
Stop glaring at me.
Rawinder, you have helped us enough. I'll forever feel indebted to you.
You should go and save your family now.
Kaleem and I will take care of the remaining people.
You take care of yourself and obey your superior's commands.
-Why are you still here? Get going! -Get hold of him!
Go away!
They are all hiding inside the gurdwara.
I have thought this through.
My family is more important to me.
Jogi has hidden all the Sikhs of lane number six in the gurdwara.
I can't attack them alone.
I'll be needing assistance of your men who are posted around lane number six.
Jogi has turned the gurdwara into a fortress.
He has realized his mistake and wants to make amends, Lali.
But I don't trust him.
You should go with him.
If he fails in carrying out his duties...
you can carry out yours.
Lali!
Have some respect for this place, if not for the people inside.
The carpets are warm.
They were here.
They might have fled.
They didn't flee.
He helped them escape.
Well done, Rawinder.
You devised an excellent plan.
You brought all our men here...
so that the people could easily escape.
Haven't you played hide-and-seek with me when we were little?
I've been a sly player ever since I was a child.
This is not a game and we aren't children anymore.
You have messed with the wrong person.
Tejpal won't spare you or your family.
At least look where we are standing right now, Lali.
We're in front of God.
Everyone's life lies in the hands of God. Be it me...
you...
or your boss Tejpal.
Did you find information on the truck, Ram Manohar?
Yes, sir. I did.
It's registered under a man named Kaleem.
-Kaleem? -Yes, sir.
-Kaleem Ansari? -Yes, sir.
Reports from many parts of the capital have also stated that shops owned by people of the Sikh community...
have also stated that shops owned by people of the Sikh community...
In order to control the situation, security has been beefed up
at the Delhi border.
The ministers have appealed to the people of the nation to keep the peace.
In order to control the situation, nationwide security has been beefed up.
Tea?
Is everything alright, Jogi?
Yes, everything's fine.
-But they haven't eaten anything. -Shehnaaz is making arrangements.
Come with me.
Take care.
KALEEM ANSARI
Greetings, Shehnaaz.
Lali, it's you!
Greetings!
It's been so many years.
I was thinking about you guys.
That's about it.
May I come in?
Oh, don't say that. Please come in.
Thank you.
Where's Kaleem?
Well, he's been out since morning.
Three of his trucks were burnt at the Delhi-Ghaziabad border in the riots.
So, that's where he is.
I see.
-Are you sure? -Yes.
We've also found one of his trucks. DLC 2321.
It has been used to carry out some deplorable activities.
The food smells great, Shehnaaz!
Oh!
That's a big container!
Is there a feast today?
No... it's nothing like that.
-Shall I make you some tea? -No, Shehnaaz. I don't want tea.
Just give me a glass of water.
Sure.
Thank you. I'll take your leave.
Once Kaleem returns home, please tell him to come and see me.
Alright.
Take care, Shehnaaz.
The situation is pretty bad.
Let's go, Ram Manohar.
-What did Shehnaaz say? -She was lying through her teeth.
Thank God! That was a close shave.
You know how Lali is.
If he could get here...
it wouldn't take him long to get to the dargah.
I know where they are hiding the Sikhs. Call our men.
Okay.
Kaleem, they are here. Hurry up.
Daler!
Daler, they are here!
-Get everyone out of here! -Get up, everyone! Run that way!
Hurry up!
Run!
Come on, hurry up!
Jogi!
Stop!
Kaleem, don't-- -What are you doing, man? -Stop it. Kaleem!
-He's one of us! -Don't get in the way!
Please hear me out, Lali!
Jogi, let's go!
Damn it!
Hurry up! Get in here and hide, everyone!
Jogi, Daler! Come in here!
Is everyone here?
Is everyone alright?
Are you okay?
-Sukhi? -Yes.
-Heer? -Yes.
Daler!
Daler!
Daler...
Daler, you will be fine.
Yes, sir.
Sir, please don't worry.
The work will be done.
I will keep the promise I've made. Otherwise, you can punish me.
Kuldeep, listen to me carefully.
The army will be here in a few hours.
If you don't find the residents of lane number six before that...
I will screw up your lives!
Yes, sir.
-Get going. -Yes, sir.
Go!
Come on, get to work!
Comb the locality. Nobody should get away.
You go that way with two dogs.
Good! Keep going!
Here, in this lane.
They will track us down like bloodhounds.
They will get here any time now, Jogi.
Keep searching!
I don't understand how these people are so full of hatred and vendetta.
No one's born waging a vendetta.
One day, out of the blue, someone close to you turns into your enemy.
-Quiet. -The same happened in 1947...
Lali, put the gun away.
Rawinder, you step back.
This is between the two of us.
Pull the trigger, Lali.
Take your revenge.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
I love you. And everyone in the college knows that, but you don't.
Please let it be.
Jogi.
God has given you big and beautiful eyes which clearly suggest
-that you like me back. -Why don't you understand?
Lali is my friend.
And you are his sister.
Had I not been Lali's sister...
would you confess your love for me?
Look, this is your problem, not mine.
You need not say anything.
I know your answer.
We have been lollygagging for a while now
We are having a great time And how!
We have been lollygagging for a while now
We are having a great time And how!
I'm oblivious to the surroundings
I feel like I'm lost
My bond with you is beyond words
-1857. -Correct.
What the...
-What was that? -Kammo.
Kammo!
Kammo!
I've applied for a job at the Jal Nigam.
Just pray that I get the job. It will be great!
Let's go.
Where?
Let's put an end to your fears.
-What do you mean? -Come on! What are you doing?
No matter how hard you try To shy away from love
-Come on. -Kammo, what are you doing?
I'll teach you something adventurous today. Come on.
Let's be grateful for the bond we share
You are the one in my life You bring me solace
You bring me solace
Please hide your alluring eyes
What are you doing, Kammo?
I know you are hesitant about our relationship.
Your friendship with my brother...
is the reason why you have built a wall between us.
Every time I come close to you,
the wall only gets stronger.
Well, Mr. Jogi, bear one thing in mind.
My love for you will always outweigh
your friendship with him.
Just once...
without giving it a lot of thought...
tell me...
Do you love me?
We have been lollygagging for a while now
We are having a great time And how!
We have been lollygagging for a while now
We are having a great time And how!
What happened, Jogi?
Say something!
Jogi!
No.
Here.
I got a job at the Jal Nigam!
I will see Lali tomorrow and ask for your hand in marriage.
Don't worry, Kammo. I'll fix everything.
We have been lollygagging for a while now
We are having a great time And how!
We have been lollygagging for a while now
We are having a great time And how!
Jogi.
She was feeling unwell last night.
When we took her to the doctor this morning, we found out that...
she was pregnant.
I'm sure you know...
whose child she was carrying.
-No, Lali! -Leave my hand! -Lali, no-- -Let go of my hand.
-Lali, please-- -Leave my hand, Kammo!
Lali... this is not Jogi's fault.
I love him.
You love him?
He loves me too, Lali!
He doesn't love you. He has used you.
Please forgive us, Lali. I made a mistake. Please!
Please forgive us.
My child, you don't understand.
Please forgive him, Lali.
Fine. I forgive you both.
-Now hear me out. -Yes?
I want you to...
marry a boy of my choice within two days.
-No... -I don't want to hear a word.
Don't make me do this.
Please don't make me do this, Lali.
I just can't...
Don't make me do this, Lali.
Kammo...
our reputation will be tarnished.
Please listen to me. Do it for the honor of the family.
Just do as I say.
I raised my hand to her for the first time today.
I've always regarded you as my brother.
I have blindly trusted you
with my home and family.
Lali, I...
I was going to tell you everything.
When?
I don't understand if I'm angry with my sister...
or with my friend...
who deceived me.
Lali!
She slit her wrist, Jogi!
Lali, please calm down.
-I won't spare you! -Lali, please.
My sister died because of you!
I won't spare you, Jogi!
Lali is my friend.
Had I not been Lali's sister...
would you confess your love for me?
I won't spare you!
My sister died because of you!
My love for you will always outweigh
your friendship with him.
My sister died because of you! I won't spare you, Jogi!
I haven't slept a wink ever since that happened, Jogi.
My sister killed herself because of you.
Because of me?!
Kammo killed herself because
your ego and arrogance outweighed your relationship and bond with your sister!
She might be dead for you, Lali, but not for me!
Do you think you've been grieving alone?
You know, I always told Kammo,
"Lali won't understand our relationship."
But she'd smile and tell me,
"My love for you will always outweigh your friendship with him."
And that's what happened.
Love has outweighed friendship.
And do you really believe that I betrayed your trust?
Your reputation was more important to me than love!
You've been grieving your sister's death,
but I've been far more agonized.
I didn't just lose the woman I loved...
but also my unborn child.
This is beyond your ken, Lali.
You never understood your sister. How will you ever understand me?
If you think you will sleep peacefully after killing me,
then let's end this for good.
Pull the trigger, Lali. Take your revenge.
But these people are innocent.
Please save them.
Save them, Lali.
If we leave him in this condition for too long, he might not make it.
Jogi, don't worry about me.
I'm fine.
We need to get out of here, Jogi.
There's only one place in the city where we can hide.
The jail in Trilokpuri police station.
Are you out of your mind?
We may as well take everyone to Tejpal's house!
He's right, Kaleem.
The jails are completely empty.
They will scour the entire city, but they won't check the jail.
Do you think 50 Sikhs can just barge into Trilokpuri Police Station
without anybody's knowledge?
I have an idea.
Come on. Hurry up.
Hurry up. Come on.
Hurry up, everyone.
Be careful.
Come on. Get in.
-Did everyone get in? -Yes.
You get inside and show them the way.
TRILOKPURI POLICE STATION EAST DELHI
Rawinder?
Rawinder?
Rawinder?
-Come on. Hurry! -Come on.
Go that way, everyone.
Go on.
-Kaleem, make them go back there. -Get back there.
-Kaleem, back there! -Hurry.
This way, everyone.
Are you okay?
Kaleem, please take care of everyone.
Rawinder and I will be back soon. Let's go.
Jogi, you're not going anywhere.
Heer, Kaleem and the others are here.
I'll be back by tomorrow morning.
No, I'm not letting you go anywhere.
Heer.
Heer.
I have made a promise which I need to fulfill.
I need help to carry Daler.
Daler, hang in there. You will be fine.
-Come on. -Jogi...
do you want to be the sole hero?
Give me a chance as well, man!
Listen to me.
An injured horse should either be killed...
-or set free. -No, Daler!
Otherwise, the entire caravan is disrupted.
So, forget about me...
and save the others.
Go on, Jogi.
Jogi.
There's a doctor I know just around the corner.
We'll take him there after dropping everyone off safely.
-Daler? -Daler?
-Daler! -Daler!
Daler!
Daler!
Daler!
Daler!
Daler!
Daler!
TRILOKPURI POLICE STATION, EAST DELHI
Did you get any information on Jogi?
Nothing yet.
Jogi...
Mr. Jogi!
Greetings to you!
There's no need to resort to violence if this can be settled with a discussion.
I don't even own a gun.
I have to borrow one always.
Look, Jogi.
I take complete responsibility to protect you and your family.
I just need you to tell me where you have hidden the residents of lane number six.
Well, alright.
You won't budge so easily.
Let me tell you about my situation.
I have nothing against Sikhs.
I visit gurdwaras myself.
But you see, we feel helpless when the circumstances aren't in our favor.
I have been sitting on my ass as a councillor for the last 15 years.
I haven't earned a ticket to become an MP yet.
But now, I have it all figured out.
Ticking more names off the list will pave the way for me to attain a ticket.
Tejpal!
Jogi!
Tejpal, let him go! You'll kill him!
Hey, it's okay. Don't hit him.
He's stubborn.
It will take some thrashing to make him yield.
Look, Rawinder.
Your friendship with him will last only as long as he lives.
If he dies, everything will be over.
Tejpal, hear me out.
Don't waste my time.
-Tejpal, please don't do that. -Where are you hiding the Sikhs?
-Tejpal, listen to me. Tejpal! -Rawinder, don't say word!
-Tejpal, listen to me! -Rawinder, shut up! Don't worry about me!
So, you won't budge!
You son of a bitch!
Jogi!
-Kuldeep. -Yes, sir?
-They are hiding in the basement. -Yes.
We scoured the whole city, while they were hiding under our asses!
Take them away.
Yes, sir.
-Ram Manohar! -Yes?
Send people in there.
Get all of them!
I'm not a bad man.
But what could I do?
The chair I want...
wields a lot of power.
Please don't do this.
The Indian Army has entered the capital,
taking command of the worst-hit areas in Delhi.
Ordinary police forces were overburdened
and were not able to bring the riots under control.
Lali...
Lali brought the army here.
Jogi...
we saved everyone's lives.
Tell the Lord

Nothing seems right without you
There is no comfort without you
Nothing seems right without you
Life is full of torment
Reality hurts like the edges of a dagger

In fact, half of all murders are committed by the spouse or partner.
And the motive is almost always jealousy and passion.
That is why I never believed the theory of an accidental hit-and-run.
I think he sat there, Christian, in the dark and the rain,
waiting for his wife, Leonora.
They warn you against all kinds of things. Smoking, alcohol.
But never against the greatest danger of them all.
I mean, love should come with a written warning.
"Love kills."
But it was never proven? Was he ever convicted for running her over?
No. And that was my fault.
No! You've solved so many cases, Dad.
But this one still haunts me.
Perhaps it was an accident. You can't be certain, can you?
Three nights before she was run over.
At 3:55 a.m.,
Christian received a text message.
Who is it?
It's just work.
Who from your work messages at four in the morning?
It was Peter.
Okay?
Can we go back to sleep?
-Can I see your phone? -Turn that off.
-Are you serious? -Yes.
You want to check my text messages?
No. I just want to know who's sending you messages at this hour.
-I don't want you to. -Why not?
-Because-- -You're seeing someone else?
-What? No. Hey, what's going on? -Why the hell are you acting so guilty?
I'm…
I'm sleeping, Leonora. You'll wake up Johan.
Then show it to me.
-No. -Why not?
Because… It's a matter of principle.
We have to trust each other. We've always said that.
Well, right now I don't trust you.
Well, you're going to have to.
Show it to me.
-I can't. -Why not?
Because it's Peter, okay?
He's seeing someone.
It's about her. And I promised him… I swore that it would be our secret.
-Now you've told me. -Yes. Thanks a lot.
Then you can show it to me.
It says the name of the woman he's seeing. You know her too.
I don't care who Peter is fucking. Show it to me.
What are you-- Hey! Would you… Stop. Let go!
Christian trained as a handyman, but then studied to become an engineer.
He and his friend, Peter, founded a construction company,
which quickly became very successful.
As a young woman, Leonora was a very talented musician.
She had won several competitions as a violinist
and was accepted to the Royal Academy of Music.
But she had to abandon her career when their son, Johan, became gravely ill.
He fought for his life for years, but was finally getting better.
-Good morning. -Good morning.
Fourteen point two kilometers.
My hair, Mom.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Dad, are you driving me?
Yes, if you help me with the midsummer bonfire later.
-Forget it. I'll take the bus. -Hey, dude. Help your old man out.
Well…
I'll drive you, baby.
Would you? I've a lot on my plate today. Thanks.
Sorry about last night.
No, I was being stupid.
Want me to get it fixed?
-No, never mind. It was old. -I have to wash the car anyway.
-No, never mind. It was old. -I have to wash the car anyway. The phone store is right next to the car wash. I might as well get it fixed.
-Mom, let's go. -Yes.
It's cool. I'll throw it out.
Thanks.
Okay.
Midsummer Eve is approaching, and we're the only country to burn witches at midsummer,
and we're the only country to burn witches at midsummer, but why do we have this tradition?
We'll discuss that after the news.
Mom, can we pick up Martha?
Who's Martha?
Just someone from school.
Oh.
Martha.
Yes.
-Hi. -Hi.
Good morning.
-Good to see you. -You too.
KOLIBRI ARCHITECTS BUILDING TEACHERS' COLLEGE
-Morning, boss. -Morning! Morning, Steen.
-Nice work on the units yesterday. -Thank you!
No, thank you!
-Good morning. -Good morning.
-Has Xenia come in? -Yes. She's over there somewhere.
Christian?
The taxman wants to see our accounts.
-Is that cool? -Yes, I hope so.
How far back?
The accountant says it's a routine check. Random computer selection.
Then why tell me?
We agreed if something important came up, we--
-Routine's not important, is it? -How long have we known each other?
Trust me.
See you tonight.
-Are you giving the speech? -I'm not gonna let you do it.
Hello? Yes. Thanks for calling. The thing is…
Hi.
Hi.
Do I look tired?
You are…
the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
You are.
The birds woke me up at four.
-Yeah, I guessed. -Did I wake you?
And not just me.
It caused this huge fight.
Didn't you read my messages?
No, I didn't have time.
You didn't have time?
What did you write?
What did she write?
That Christian should make up his mind
before they met.
If he wanted her?
Her or his wife.
An ultimatum.
-Who did he choose? -That's pure guesswork on my part.
When I saw you, smiling at me, I thought you'd made up your mind.
You didn't even read what I wrote.
I have made up my mind. It's just a matter of timing.
You've said that for six months.
-Johan is just getting better. -Yes.
Soon, he won't need that last crutch.
-And he and your wife need you. -I have to be there for him, yes.
He's my son. But that has nothing to do with you.
-Don't toy with me, Christian. -I've never loved anyone like I love you.
If you don't act, those are just words!
I mean what I wrote to you last night.
I want to have kids. I want it all.
Me too.
But the time has to be right.
Hey!
We could be so fucking great together.
-One gold wash, please. -Shall I put 100 kroner on a card?
I just want a gold wash for 79 kroner, please.
The account cards start at 100.
If you deposit 300, you get a 20 percent discount on all washes.
-Can't I just buy a gold wash? -But we only sell the cards.
In that case, a gold wash doesn't cost 79. It costs 100.
Well, you keep the card. Next time you come here, you put some more--
Next time, there's 21 kroner left which I can't use to wash my car.
Then you deposit more money.
With a 100 kroner minimum?
Yes.
That makes it 121 kroner. After the next wash, that leaves 42 kroner.
-Let me deposit 200. -Fine.
-Here you go. -Thanks.
If you only knew where people drop their phones…
Sewers, toilets. You name it.
Yes, I dropped mine when I went for a swim.
I had some important messages I hadn't read yet. I don't know…
I can still get them to read them, right?
Yes, I think we can recover them. Just give me a moment.
Let me see…
Yes… I have a Christian Holm registered.
Are you sure it's the right number?
KOLIBRI ARCHITECTS SINGLE
-Hello? -Yes, that's my husband.
He bought me the subscription.
Okay. Yes. Listen… I'm afraid I'm not allowed to do that.
You have to--
Hello?
I'm up here.
Where's Johan?
He's at Martha's place.
-Martha? -Yes.
That's new, right?
Remember when we were that age?
You were barely 20.
Will you zip me up?
Done.
Hasn't it been a while?
I need to take a shower before we go. I promised Peter I'd be there early.
You know what he's like.
Thank you. Friends, business partners, assholes…
Listen…
I'm so sure of this.
The world needs to change.
We need to live in a new and different way if there is to be a world in 50 years.
Those changes must come from all possible and impossible places.
And in our case it was Xenia
who convinced Peter and m that the teachers' college we're building,
of course, has to be self-sufficient using carbon-neutral energy.
All the materials used return to nature, once we're done using the building.
That sort of vision takes courage.
It takes a special mindset to be so visionary and innovative.
And Xenia, you possess that mindset
like no one I have ever met.
Come on. Come and take a bow.
Xenia Mikkelsen, ladies and gentlemen, our star architect.
Thank you, everybody.
-Cheers. -Cheers. Let's have a great evening.
Okay.
Are you okay?
What's wrong?
I'm just tired.
It's looking good, right?
-It's good, right? -Yes.
-Are you okay? -Yeah, I just didn't get much sleep.
Well, that's just your age. I know that feeling.
So, Kim, back when you and Anette got divorced…
How did you tell her?
Have you met someone?
-No. It's not like that. -Christ! No, neither had I…
Is what I told her. But it's not a fun thing to do.
It's a tough thing to say. But they're better off.
The women. Really.
Everyone's better off leaving a dead relationship.
-And Anette? -Well, she's doing great now.
She's… It's… She's taking some sort of further education.
If you need a new start, my advice to you is to tell her.
Straight up.
The sooner the better.
And it's not easy at first.
But then it gets better, right?
It gets really good.
When I finally told her…
For two years, when I came home from work, I was like this: "Yes! I'm free!"
It was totally awesome. It was like this: "Yeah! Freedom! Thank you!"
-Shut up. -But it's true.
-You're an idiot. You're so stupid. -Well…
Leonora…
I need… some time to think. I think.
I've had a lot on my plate for the last few years. I've…
Sort of lost myself a bit.
Do you understand?
You've said you've been frustrated too.
That we don't spend time together…
Johan's illness demanded a lot of attention.
Is there someone else?
That's not the point. This is about us.
I can't see myself as a part of this anymore.
There's no one else?
No.
I saw you yesterday, Christian.
In Peter's office.
I saw how you…
She looked me straight in the eye.
What kind of person does that?
I'm… really…
Leonora, I'm sorry.
-I didn't mean to… -You didn't mean to?
To bring your wife to a party and fuck your mistress?
How long has it been?
I don't want to hurt you.
Leonora…
I never wanted to.
You do know I can get busted for the financial scam you pulled
even if you run off with her?
I spoke to our lawyer today. I can go down as an accomplice.
Unless I go to the police now and report you for fraud.
Wait. You're…
I did what I had to do to save our son.
Are you completely insane?
Are you? He'd have died, if he hadn't had the surgeries in the US.
I kept suggesting we could take a loan.
-We couldn't. -I could have started working again.
I told you. Even 15 years ago, when I could have continued my career.
Your career? Okay.
It wouldn't have been enough, Leonora. And who would've looked after Johan?
Yes! I wonder who! Could you perhaps have done that?
No! Because I had to earn the money. We made a deal.
Exactly. We made a deal.
And I sacrificed my career for that deal.
You worked and I took care of Johan. We did what we needed to do. Together!
Where does that leave me now?
You can do so much. You…
You can teach.
Teach?
You have no fucking clue.
I can't even be a substitute.
A violinist at my age who hasn't played for 20 years.
I gave up everything!
Now you're feeling sorry for yourself
because you're in love and want to abandon everything.
I have to think about myself.
What do you mean?
I'm going to the police. I have to.
And tell them what? We did it for our son. Together!
I'm not stopping you.
But I'm not going to go down like Kim's wife did.
Guess where she's working?
In a fucking supermarket.
That's not happening to me. Not after all I've sacrificed.
I've sacrificed as well!
I've worked non-stop. I donated my bone marrow to Johan!
You laid on a table for two hours.
-I could have been crippled. -Is that your narrative?
That you sacrificed yourself because some brochure said
there was 1% risk of complications?
I've stood by that boy's side and shared his every breath since he was born.
And now I stand as an accomplice to a crime that'll make you rich!
Hey. Is this about money?
-Because we can arrange-- -No. It's not about money.
It's about the deal we made.
A pact. You and me and Johan. We were together.
We all gave up something for that deal.
One of the thing we gave up was the option to leave.
If you leave now, I'll be thinking only of myself.
That's all. I don't do it to punish you.
I wonder if Xenia will love you after five years in jail.
I just need to understand the question.
-I'm nervous. -Nervous? Isn't it a bit late for that?
We'll tell them it was a mistake that we just discovered.
-A mistake? -Yes. It's easily done.
-Then we discover it-- -No. We broke the law.
We manipulated the exchange rate and made a fortune.
Will you just find out if we can pay it back?
I'll pay your share.
Who the hell are we going to pay it back to?
We pressed the rate to make a profit. We didn't rob anyone.
It is always better to turn yourself in.
-You were the one who needed the money. -And you didn't object, did you?
Sorry.
-Is something else going on? -No.
We're not doing anything. We're gonna keep our mouths shut, okay?
Yes.
Christian?
Okay.
What's happening with you and me?
I've told her.
It's done.
So, it's you and me?
Of course it is.
You and me.
Christian, I know it's a difficult time.
Could I ask you for something? A small favor?
Yes, of course.
My mom is in town today with her boyfriend. She's not here often.
I'd really like you to meet her.
Today?
Would you?
Yes, of course.
I love you.
And I love you.
It'll be a great bonfire, right?
It's much bigger than the one Per and those guys had last year.
-Christian? -What?
-The bonfire. -Yes.
Has it gone to shit at home?
Well, things are not good. Things are not good.
Leonora, she…
She won't let me go.
It's not up to her, is it?
She's knows stuff.
Do you mean threats?
-That happened to me too. -What did you do?
I actually did nothing. She went to see some of her old friends.
They supported her, talked to her.
Made her believe in a new and better life without me.
But Leonora hardly knows anyone.
-Johan's taken up of all her time. -There must be someone you can call?
Leonora doesn't want to talk to anyone.
But you can't both leave her and also be her shoulder to cry on.
Find an old friend of hers. Someone to support her.
Dad, how do you know Leonora followed him?
We can tell by the cell phone towers.
We can see they were driving their own cars. One behind the other.
And Christian drove to town to track down Leonora's old friend, Kassandra.
Oh my God.
I hardly recognized you. How many years is it?
-I'm not even sure. -Was it at the christening?
-How old is Johan? -He'll be 18. Graduates tomorrow.
It's crazy. 18 years!
Haven't you talked to Leonora since then?
Not a word. Best friends, and then suddenly nothing.
Leonora has always been completely… either or.
-Either you were in, or you were out. -Yeah.
She's not the type you just leave.
In what way?
She had a boyfriend way back.
Mike.
-Did she tell you about him? -Mike? No, I don't think so.
It's just that…
He died.
Okay…
It was a really sad story where we grew up.
No, she never told me.
It was a terrible story.
He fell off a cliff.
Died instantly.
I don't know much. I wasn't there.
-But they were dating? -Yes. They were an item. And then…
They said he was leaving Leonora.
That he was with another girl that night.
Who are "they"?
You know… Rumors. It was a small town.
Okay, and how does the rumor go?
That Leonora pushed him…
Well, that's completely crazy.
Yes.
Listen…
The man I married,
had kids with…
It turned out he was in love with another woman for 12 years.
She was married too.
They had a kind of…
a secret marriage.
I knew nothing.
We fall in love. We marry…
But we knew nothing.
I had some good advice when I got divorced.
Divorce is a business transaction.
Money, house, kids.
And the other side of the deal.
The threats, the disclosures.
Who says what to the kids?
Who's at fault?
It's best to have something to bargain with.
What was the name of the girl Mike was seeing?
Hello?
Hi, it's Sonja.
Sonja. Thanks for calling.
-I only have a few minutes. -That's fine.
Kassandra said you maybe saw someone when Mike died?
-Can you tell me about it? -It was mainly a feeling, you know?
A feeling.
Okay.
But can you tell me what happened?
Well, we…
We had a party out there.
And then Mike and I, we… You know…
-Yes, you had a thing? -Yes. We were very much in love.
Where are you going?
-Mike. -What?
What did you see?
I don't know for sure,
but I felt like someone was watching us.
Did you see Leonora?
Maybe.
I will never forget that scream.
But did you see her? Yes or no?
Yes.
I was so certain.
That evening.
It was Leonora.
Did you tell the police back then?
Sonja had told the police everything.
I reviewed it all.
-What did the police report say? -That Leonora was questioned.
That she and Mike had sort of broken up.
In one interview, Sonja said she saw Leonora.
In the next, she wasn't sure.
But Leonora had been practicing all evening at the academy.
The music tutor was questioned.
They found nothing.
Leonora's alibi checked out.
Sorry.
Yes.
Yes, let's drink to that.
Are you off for a run?
Pack your stuff.
I want you out.
Fine. But you're not reporting me to the police.
Right?
Leonora, I talked to your old friend.
Kassandra.
She told me about your old boyfriend.
Mike.
She said…
he wanted to leave you because he had met someone else.
Sonja.
But then…
he suddenly died.
They say you killed him.
That no one can leave you.
You're totally nuts.
-Can't you hear it? -I'm not saying… It's just…
I think you need someone to talk to, Leonora.
I think you need help.
You're the one fucking someone else
and then you show up with an old urban legend about me killing my boyfriend?
That's called demonizing.
You're the one who needs help.
Are you packing then?
I can't. Not if you're reporting me to the police.
If you want to stay, you must end it with her.
Call her now.
I want to hear it.
Fine. Right.
Then I'll call the police.
You don't get to cheat on me and then drag me down.
Leonora, stop. Please stop?
Why do you want this?
Why do you want me when I am saying to you that…
I love her?
You really think it's all about you?
It's about something bigger, something you've forgotten that matters.
Family.
So for the last time, either you call her to end it,
or I'll call the police.
Then Xenia can visit you in jail as much as she wants.
Leonora…
I beg you.
Then do it!
Hi, Christian.
My mom loved you.
-Hi, Xenia. -I can barely hear you.
Hey.
-Christian? Are you there? -I'm…
Christian? Are you there?
I can't.
I know. I know it's not fair to you.
But…
But I love her.
I've never loved anyone like her.
-Get out. Out. -I'm not…
-Let go! -Get out.
-Calm down, Leonora. -Get out! You're leaving now!
-Get out! -Calm down.
-Get out! -Leonora! Think of Johan.
What about him?
He'll never talk to you again. Never!
Whose side do you think he'll be on?
Out!
Here! We're swapping cars.
From now on it's my Mercedes. My house! And my son!
All animals are the same.
When it has no other options,
when it is cornered,
it will attack.
I think he went to the office first.
Left his cell phone there. Made sure the cleaners saw him.
Things like that.
That seems very calculated for a crime of passion.
Some people can do it.
Even if they are desperate and have lost it all,
they manage to keep a cool head. It's a survival mechanism.
An instinct. When all your feelings are suspended,
except one…
Hatred.
CAR WASH
Fucking bitch.
Hey, Dad.
Hey. You're home?
Yes. Final exam tomorrow.
Is it?
Yeah. Are you okay?
Yeah, of course.
I should be asking you that. Final exam and all.
Then you get
to put your cap on and all that?
Yes.
Have you seen Mom?
Are you okay?
Yeah. It's just been a long day. I'm gonna take a shower.
Okay.
Why are you here?
What's going on?
What's wrong with you?
Did you change your mind?
And you've ended it with her?
What changed your mind?
I…
Hi, Mom.
Hi, baby. I didn't even know you were home.
-How long have you been home? -A couple of hours.
It's at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.
I'm on top of it. And are you okay?
-Are you hungry? -Mom, stop fussing. It's fine.
Okay.
Well. I'll grab a shower.
I'm totally beat. My new route is almost 20 kilometers.
-Your new route? -Yes. In the woods. It's so beautiful.
Haven't we always been good together?
Yes.
Perhaps there's something you want to try?
Something new?
What do you mean?
We could buy something.
Some toys, perhaps.
Would you like that?
Yes.
Why are you here?
Can we talk about it tomorrow?
It's been a…
tough evening for both of us.
Do you still want me?
Yes.
Johan is next door. He's still awake.
I have to feel if you mean it.
That you're over her.
Sorry. Sorry, can we just…
Give me a chance, okay?
Can I please just… Can I just hold you?
Is that okay?
We're taking Mom's.
How come?
-Well, because she… -Hey, hey…
Aren't you going to say goodbye to your mom?
I'm in a hurry.
I still get to wish my son good luck, don't I?
Okay.
-Good luck. -Thanks.
Let's swap back.
-Hey. -Hi.
Did you hear that a woman was run down and killed last night?
-What? -On that dangerous stretch after the bend.
-How awful. -Dad.
Let's go.
-I have to… -Of course. Talk later?
-Isn't that awful? -Right on the bend?
-Yes. -Last night?
Yes. Not that late.
They say it was a hit-and-run. How can anyone do that?
Who was she?
Mother of three out for a run.
-Isn't it awful? -Yes.
I usually jog here.
Yes. Yes, okay. Yes. No.
No, you don't need to. That's fine. Yes. Okay, bye.
Holger, the rain didn't help, so I'll send forensics home.
You saw her.
Did you talk to her?
That was later.
At their son's graduation party.
HONK AND WE DRINK!
ONE HONK = ONE SIP THREE HONKS = CHEERS!
Tell me, did my head shrink since I graduated?
Yours fits better.
It suits you better too.
-Where did you find it? -In the basement.
-That'll be Peter. Would you…? -Yes.
Christian?
It's the police.
-Hello. -Hello.
We're knocking on doors in the hope of finding someone who can help.
Yes. It's about that hit-and-run woman.
-Oh. Yes. -Yes.
Were you at home the other night, around 10:30?
The day before yesterday?
Wasn't that the night you got home late? I think Johan said--
Oh yes. I was working late at the office.
What time did you get home?
-It was probably around… What time? -I don't know.
Hello? The door was open.
-Peter. -So, where is my godson?
He's outside. Johan, look who's here.
-Hey, dude. -Hey!
-Congratulations. -Did you see anything?
-No. -Or hear anything?
I'm afraid not.
-Call if you remember anything. -Sure. Let me walk you out.
-Enjoy the party. -Thanks.
XENIA: PLEASE CALL ME?
WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING?
OKAY, JUST FORGET IT. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIKE THIS…
-What's wrong? -What?
You just seem a bit…
Well, that was the night I ended it with Xenia.
I didn't want to tell them or they'd question her too.
Were you with her that night?
Yes, briefly and then I came back home. I told you.
I thought you called her from the car.
We're off.
We have to sing the song! "Thank you to the parents." Come on.
Thanks to the parents
Thanks for Johan and beer
We're going out to drink We're going out to drink
We'll puke in every single hedge
And drink until we fall down
Behind the monoliths
Behind the monoliths
WE LOVE YOU
WE MISS YOU
WE LOVE YOU
MOM IN HEAVEN
Yes.
Yes.
Fine. Thank you. Yes, I understand. But I have to get your name first.
-I would like to turn my-- -Can't you see I'm busy?
You'll have to wait.
Please take a seat.
Right. You were saying?
And what the time was that? Do you know approximately?
Yes.
Okay. But we… Yes.
But if we write between 9:30 and 11:00, that should be…
JOHAN: FUCKING GREAT PARTY, DAD. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.
The police are still looking for the hit-and-run driver
and particularly for a white van,
which witnesses believe might have had Romanian license plates.
The police fear that the driver has fled the country.
If you have any information
to help in the search, please contact your local police.
The government and its supporters have agreed on who…
CAR WASH
I never understood why Leonora started to suspect Christian.
But she figured it out somehow.
Do you remember selling me this card?
You're the mathematician.
Yes. I deposited 200 kroner and bought a gold wash for 79.
So, there should be 121 kroner left. There isn't.
-You've used the card twice. -No, I haven't.
First time was on the 15th at 9:27 a.m. The second time, the 17th at 10:18 p.m.
Last Wednesday?
Johan?
Christian?
Could you come up?
-Where's Johan? -Outside. With Martha.
Okay, I have to talk to--
I wanted to wash the car.
I couldn't believe how quickly you made a mess of it.
I couldn't understand why there was no money on the card.
I said that the card hadn't been used Wednesday night.
And you know?
I was so persistent
that the cashier found the surveillance tape for me.
He sent me a file.
Have a look.
You wanted to kill me.
It should've been me.
We're picking something up over at… What's going on?
-You don't look well. -Hey.
I just have to talk to Mom. Could you wait outside?
-Is it the doctor? Am I sick again? -No. Hey. I just have to talk to her.
-Go on. -Are you getting divorced?
Mom? Are you okay?
Hi.
-What's up? -Hi, Martha.
Hey.
Come on.
Stop.
Don't come near me.
The neighbor's in the garden. I'll scream.
No, Leonora. I'm not… Could you calm down, please?
Calm down?
You tried to kill me!
-No. -You…
-You killed an innocent woman. -No. No, I…
I'm calling the police.
Wait. Can we just talk about it? Can't you wait a sec?
I wasn't… Just wait. Can't we…
-Hello? -Wait a minute. I'll…
It's Leonora Holm. You were at our house yesterday.
-I will talk to… -About the hit-and-run.
-Let's just talk. -Yes, we're at number 23.
Hi. My wife thought we should call.
I'm the one who…
I saw a van that night.
Yes, it was foreign. Romanian, I think. Sorry. Can I call you back?
Wait.
-Give me my phone. -I can't hear you.
-I need my phone. -I can't hear you.
-Can we go inside? Please. -I'm not going in that house with you.
-Leonora. Calm down. -You tried…
-You… -Can't we…?
Sorry.
Think of Johan.
Did you think of Johan when you tried to kill me?
That he'd live without his mother?
You have called Leonora. Please leave a message.
Fuck!
Dad, what's going on?
Dad…
I love you. You know that?
You know that, right?
What's wrong?
Hey, can you do me a favor?
-What? -Go to your room and wait.
Why? Who's knocking on the door?
Just do as I say.
Do as I say, okay?
Go on.
May we come in?
Can we do it outside?
My son's inside. I'd like to spare him.
Well, your wife called us.
Yes.
You say it had foreign plates?
The van.
Well, I…
just saw it out of the corner of my eye.
We've had so many burglaries. So we keep an eye out for foreign vans.
Where was it from?
The van.
I'm not sure. I think it was Romanian.
Why do you think that?
The license plate.
MEET ME AT L'EPUISETTE AT 9:00 P.M.
What's on a Romanian license plate?
"RO." It says "RO."
I know what you're thinking. He was practically glowing with guilt.
But I needed the most important thing, evidence.
Do you understand why we're meeting here?
I've done a lot of thinking in the last few hours.
I've weighed each of your crimes on…
What to call it…
The scales of justice?
The three motherless children would certainly be best served
with you behind bars for life.
-Yes. -But I'm no judge.
First and foremost, I'm Johan's mother.
He is the only good thing I've achieved.
I sacrificed it all for him to have a good life.
If you go to jail
for fraud and murder, everything was in vain.
That brings me to my next problem.
My life will always be in danger.
What?
You have tried to kill me. You'll try again.
No, I won't.
No.
I'm not a…
I would do anything to change what I did.
Leonora. Tell me what to do?
Do to her what you intended to do to me.
Xenia.
As long as she's out there, my life is in danger.
Because I'm a threat. To you.
Sorry, I need to understand this. You want me to… I have to…
Stop it, Leonora.
I was out of my mind in that moment.
Do you understand? Your threat of reporting me.
I would never have reported you.
I just didn't want to lose. Not that way. Not to her.
I promise, I'll never lay a hand on you.
All I can think of is Johan. Saving him.
That'll only happen if you do to her what you wanted to do to me.
We'll share the burden. It'll be our project.
Before, it was just your project. To get rid of me.
Now we get rid of her and the threat to our relationship.
I'll be an accomplice.
Because I know.
It'll be our secret.
Hey, stop. Now. Stop.
Just stop it!
What are you even saying? Are you completely insane? I won't…
Think of Johan.
It would only increase the risk of me being found out.
Johan would take the hit.
He'd lose both of us, and that would ruin his life.
You're making no sense.
Okay, look.
Just listen.
Stop it.
Leonora, you're making no sense.
You should've thought about that before you tried to kill his mother.
Besides, it's only a matter of planning.
And you're good at it, it turns out.
You need an alibi.
Like me that night.
The night Mike went over the edge of the cliff.
I knew he was seeing someone else.
I could feel it.
There he was. Right by the edge.
He didn't look scared.
He just looked…
surprised.
Hello.
I'm about to lock up for the night. Close the windows when you leave?
-You're just guessing again, aren't you? -Am I?
Pay attention.
Leonora's teacher says she heard her all evening, but hadn't actually seen her.
Sound as an alibi.
Voilà.
You're getting the King Suite.
It's our best room.
-This is beautiful. -Yes.
-Do you need anything else? -When does the spa close?
-At 10.30 p.m. You have plenty of time. -Thank you.
Are you ready?
Make sure nobody sees you leave here.
-And, Christian? -Yes.
The timing.
The text message. It has to look like a home invasion.
You can do this, honey.
You've done it before.
Remember?
This is lovely. It is just what we need.
It's time.
-Hi, can I come in? -Get lost.
Xenia.
I'm not doing this anymore. You disappeared. It's over.
My only son just graduated. Leonora has had a complete breakdown.
-Give me a chance. -Dream on, Christian.
I'm not your plaything. Get lost.
What the hell are you doing? Have you gone insane! Let go!
I love you.
Xenia?
I've never loved anyone like I love you.
Are you okay?
Hi, Xenia. Did I hear glass breaking?
No. It's nothing. I'm just clumsy.
-Goodnight. -Goodnight, then.
I'm calling from the King Suite. We've decided to order room service.
Sounds good. We'd like the shrimp for starters.
Wait, my husband is calling from the bathroom.
He's changed his mind. Cold tomato soup for starters.
Where the hell were you?
A lot has happened.
Can I have a drink?
What do you want?
Whatever you're having.
DEAR XENIA
Christian.
I CAN'T DO IT. I'M SORRY. MY FAMILY IS EVERYTHING TO ME.
-Come in. -It's room service.
That was fast. Time to get out of the tub, Christian. Dinner is here.
-Could you please sign here? -Yes.
-Thank you very much. -Let me get you a tip. Just a sec.
Christian?
I need a tip for the waiter.
I think there's some in my pants. The gray ones.
They're on the bed.
Okay.
-You really don't have to. -I have it right here.
Well…
Thank you very much.
Bon appétit.
I could feel you.
Looking at me.
You're the most beautiful person in the world.
Xenia?
Are you okay?
Hey!
Are you okay, Xenia?
I knew you couldn't do it.
-Hi. -Hi.
The entire place was suspiciously clean of DNA and fingerprints.
The sheets had just been changed.
Her computer, wallet, and cellphone were gone as well.
We got a warrant and access to the last text messages.
Wanna to know what they said?
"Dear Xenia. I just can't do this. I'm sorry."
"My family is everything to me."
That sounds like a man with cold feet.
Was it him?
Christian Holm.
Leonora.
Honey, you're home.
Let me do the talking if you don't know what to say.
Come on.
We can't keep meeting like this.
How can we help?
Christian, we're here concerning a woman with whom you work.
Xenia Mikkelsen.
Maybe it's best if we talk in private?
No, it's fine by me.
It seems like there was a burglary at Xenia's weekend cottage.
A neighbor heard something suspicious.
Now there's no trace of her and she's reported missing.
We're investigating anyone she had contact with.
I'm afraid I don't know anything. Sorry.
But you were in contact with her the other day?
On Sunday.
Yes.
I broke up with her.
We had an affair.
For how long?
For a little over a year.
Christian and I have been together for over 20 years.
Our son was very ill. We had a rough time.
Christian and I have both had affairs.
Ups and downs are only natural in a long marriage.
I don't know if you'd understand?
-Are you married? -Yes.
My wife died last year.
You messaged Xenia late Sunday night.
-Where were you? -We were at a spa resort.
In Kongebrogården.
You're welcome to check.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Is she alive?
We've seen people turn up again after 20 days.
Yes. And after 20 years. But I'm asking.
Is Xenia alive?
No.
But why remove the dead body
if it was a burglary and murder?
The body might lead to the killer?
If they had just had sex.
-Check the little ports along the coast. -We're on it. We'll find the body.
Get K9 up there to search the woods.
They're gone.
We're doing this. Together.
For Johan.
And for us.
What about the body?
Exactly.
Where the hell is the body?
How far to the lake?
About a kilometer that way.
That's a long way to drag a body. We would have found tracks.
Okay, let's split up.
You go towards the road, and we'll head to the lake.
Then he heads towards…
It's police dogs. They're searching for that missing woman.
Are we lighting the bonfire?
Hell no. It's only eight. Much too early.
-The forecast said rain… -Yes. Later.
Why don't you light it?
Hey, buddy.
Wait up. You don't get to do it by yourself.
I want to light it before the rain.
Yes, okay. Fine.
Christian wants us to light the fire now…
Cheers, Dad.
Easy.
Follow along the water's edge.
-Hand me the gasoline. -Sure. God, it stinks out here.
We must have gotten some hedgehogs mixed in.
Looking good.
Give me one more.
-Easy now. -We'll search on the shore.
Do you have a lighter?
No, I don't. Strike a few at a time?
Let's move on.
Holger, this is a dead-end.
We love our country
When the blessed Christmas lights
The star in the tree With a sparkle in every eye
When in spring, every bird Over fields and beaches
Bends its voice To a welcoming warble
Your word is our song Across every road and street
-Excuse me. Could I try them? -Yes, of course.
But Dad, even if you burn a body like that, the bones will remain.
-Bones disintegrate at 1200 degrees. -Exactly.
But now you have something you can put in a bag. The rest is gone.
SOLD
Hi.
-It's time. -Finally.
The boat from Zealand was delayed. -How about you? Are you ready? -Yes.
-How about you? Are you ready? -Yes. My dad has spent the entire time trying to talk me out of it.
You're such a romantic.
I'm just a realist.
People think getting married is where happiness begins.
I'm not saying it's not. It may be.
But so much can happen.
And bear in mind that you could just as easily be walking into the arms of your enemy.
How do I look?
My love, you are the most beautiful woman.
No man on this Earth deserves you.
Haven't you been listening to me at all?
I'm just saying that love is far more dangerous than its reputation.
Once you go in, anything can happen.
Are you ready for that?
Yes.
I thought singing Mario Bautista
and passing out on a condom was rock bottom.
But I was wrong.
But this isn't where it all started. Let me go back a few months.
A FEW MONTHS AGO
-What are you doing? -What?
You're fucked up.
Fuck is what I'm going to do to all these girls.
Hold on. What are you doing, man?
What the fuck, pervert?
What are you doing?
Why don't you…
No!
-What'd he say? -He wants a blowjob.
-He's a bit tipsy. -He's drunk.
We're sorry.
Sorry. That's it. Goodbye to my fucking fantasy.
Your fantasy is a blowjob at a party?
-Yeah, so what? -No way.
-Yours is better? -It's better than yours.
-Go on. -Listen up.
Fucking in the clouds, on a plane, with my dream girl.
Don't be an idiot.
-What? -Forget your fantasies.
-Ana won't talk to me again. -She never did.
-It's your fault. -Me?
-We were finally invited to a party. -I was invited.
Whatever.
The music was just fucking reggaeton and Mario Bautista, who's crap.
You don't like anything. He's cool.
Come on. Reggaeton rocks.
You only like old people music.
What? Led Zeppelin? The Stones?
They're legends.
Reggaeton is garbage. It's just noise.
-And Mario B is-- -Shit!
Exactly, man.
No. You just stepped in shit.
Mario or not, they're not inviting us to another party. Thanks.
Relax.
We don't need invitations for the graduation party,
or for the famous Christmas party,
the party we've waited for since we--
Stop it!
He's right, though.
You need a date to go to the Christmas party.
We don't need to worry about that.
But you…
What about me?
-Tell him. -We're worried about you.
Everyone's had sex except you.
-You get stupid around girls. -You need contact.
-I've had contact. -Come on, buddy.
Jerking off daily isn't contact.
Jerking off daily?
-I'm touching myself for you. -Yes, touch yourself, babe.
-Touch yourself. -Oh, yes!
That feels amazing.
Touch yourself for me.
Come here, babe.
Mom! Can't you knock?
Are you doing something you shouldn't be?
Of course not, but what if I was? What are you doing with my fan?
I can't sleep without it. The heat suffocates me.
-I'll carry it. -Here.
Bring it through here. Let's work out where to put it.
Look, over here.
What for, Mom?
Uncle Jaime arrives today,
and I don't want you sharing a room with your sister again.
What? So--
So you're sleeping here. You'll share the bathroom with your uncle.
He comes every four months for at least two weeks and I'm sleeping here?
-Yes. -No way.
No means no.
Come on, Chema.
Your uncle has never let us down.
And you know that your father's last wish
was for his best friend to keep an eye on us.
I'm sure that's all there is to it.
-What did you say? -Nothing.
-Don't be mean. -Bye. I'm in a rush.
Wait for your brother.
I'm not waiting. It's the first day of school.
Love you. Bye.
Hurry up. You're going to be late.
The school is a three-minute walk.
Literally.
Literally, hurry up.
Where's my kiss?
HORIZON EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTE
Sorry, Tommy.
I'm kidding.
Hey.
What's up?
To the max!
-Last photo, ready? -Come on.
The classic pose?
-I'm laughing. -Look good.
Move over here.
Like fine wine.
Ten years together.
Love you guys.
Time for school?
Let's go.
Hey.
-His jacket is cool. -Yeah, the popular kids.
This sucks. I didn't wanna come back.
We're going to miss it all so much.
No way.
The only thing we'll miss is Hanna and Alexa rubbing tits.
Right, fellas?
Instant karma.
Why?
Like they talk about us like that?
Of course not. I'm sure they say stuff like--
Chema, jump in.
I'm going to miss Eli's smile.
-Stop fucking around. -What?
Isn't she your cousin?
-She's not my cousin. -This isn't Game of Thrones.
Cousin is just a pet name. We're not really cousins.
-"A pet name." -I swear.
Chema, seriously.
You should try to get with someone this year.
Besides, Eli's out of your league.
Fucking Hugo.
He had sex twice and now thinks he's Drake.
He's a show-off.
The thing is, Chema,
making love…
-What's up? -…it changed my life.
What you doing?
I can't stop thinking about what Ana and I did.
But now when I see her, I can't even talk to her.
-I don't know why. -Go on.
-No, Chema. -Go!
You wouldn't like it then.
-Hello. -Hi, Chema.
Hi, Eli.
-What's up? -We said not the cousin.
She's not my cousin.
There are thousands of women.
Maybe not thousands for you but--
Go for it, bro.
Experiment.
"Experiment."
To try something for the first time.
That's what we'll be doing in this class,
and I hope that's what you're doing in your lives.
Let's get to work.
Bernardo asked me to the Christmas party.
That's so exciting!
We were worried about you.
-I got asked last year. -You were the only one without a date.
I know, but not anymore.
What do you want?
Focus on your work.
You had some fluff, but it's gone now.
Fuck.
Hello.
No, never mind.
-Chema! -I'm not eavesdropping, I swear.
Come.
The cat used my Zen garden as a toilet again.
Ms. Cholita, why don't you ask someone else?
I always clean it.
Class, which student here is the biggest softie?
Chema.
So, off you go.
No, clean it properly. Clean the whole thing. Take it away.
I just need to remove the poop.
"The Softie."
Someone who's easily talked into doing the things you don't want to.
"Play a role."
"Apply to be a DJ during break next semester."
"Students must apply in pairs."
Dang. Why does everything have to be in pairs?
José María?
No, Principal. "Dang" isn't vulgar.
No, I wanted to ask you for a favor.
You're such a-- What do they call you? Softie.
I'm not as much of a pushover as they say.
Don't say that. You wouldn't let me down, would you?
I'm not a softie, but I won't let you down.
-Good. -What is it?
What do you need? Filing? Cleaning?
I don't need you to file or clean anything this time.
I just need you to show someone around. To pamper her, so to speak.
She's our newest student, just moved here from beautiful Acapulco.
Claudia Galeana.
Claudia?
Hello.
Chema, right?
Close your mouth, dear.
Dear, close your mouth.
-Sorry, what do you need me to file? -Nothing.
I just want you to pamper Claudia.
What's wrong, dear?
Turn and look at Claudia.
What's wrong with you?
I can ask someone else if you want.
No.
-Then pull yourself together. -No.
-No one is as soft as me, right? -That's what I thought.
Real soft, right?
I can…
pamper, as you say, the beautiful--
our new classmate from beautiful Acapulco.
Good. Then it's all set.
So, that's it.
-This is where you enter and exit. -That's so cool.
The tour was great.
How's my Mexico City accent?
Beautiful.
If you have a car, you can park it there, or wherever you find space.
No, I don't have one.
But I hope I can get a ride from someone.
From me!
I can come pick you up.
I can pick you up and take you home as many times as you need.
Oh baby. You'd really pick me up?
Of course.
I live pretty far, in a place called Sayavedra.
It took me an hour to get here.
-Sayavedra, right. -Yeah.
I know it well. It's on my way.
-Really? -Yeah.
That's great, thanks.
I told you, I'm not lending you the car.
Or should I say, "giving you the car"?
You say you need it all day?
When have I ever asked you for a favor? Never.
This isn't a favor, it's leaving me without a car.
What do you need it for?
Stop bothering me. I already said no.
Your uncle will be here any minute. Take this.
See? There he is. I'm coming!
Jaime.
-Gloria, look at you. -It's so nice to see you.
You look gorgeous.
-Come in. Let me help you. -All right.
Kids! I'm here!
-Uncle! -Kids!
Look at you, Begoña.
-How are you? -You're just as pretty as your mom.
With all due respect.
I missed you, Uncle!
It's been so long.
I know, I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.
I brought you something. Close your eyes.
Close your eyes. No peeking.
-Is this it? -Yes.
Look.
No way. I love it.
Thank you!
-I'm gonna open it. -Go ahead.
-Hi, Uncle. -Damn.
Look at how big you are.
Strong and handsome like your dad.
-So, has it started? -What?
Senior year.
-What are you going to study? -Engineering, like Dad.
As long as you're passionate about it,
nothing else matters.
Look what I brought you.
Has your initials and everything.
Now you can throw this shit away.
Your eardrums will thank you.
They're cool, Uncle. Thanks a lot.
No problem.
-They're so cool. -Yeah.
And for my Gloria--
I'm getting something too?
Something small. Close your eyes.
All right.
-No. -Goat.
So delicious.
And the best.
Top-quality beef tongue to cook in pipián.
Finger-licking good.
My mouth is watering, Jaime.
How was the trip?
It took me 23 hours, not counting stops.
That's so long.
That's why I brought my old truck.
I'm going to leave it here for whenever I visit.
Then I can just fly back home.
Why didn't you do this before?
-Sometimes I don't think straight. -Uncle!
-You must be exhausted. -Yes.
Come get settled in my room.
Go get settled. I'll put this all away.
-Go on. -Let's go.
I'll help you!
How hospitable.
-We missed you, Uncle. -Really?
I can cook it with eggs tomorrow.
-You brought a lot. -Delicious.
You can plug in your phone there.
Easy, man.
This is a first-class welcome.
Honestly, we really missed you.
I missed you more.
I couldn't fucking wait to see you guys.
The year your dad went to study in London changed his life.
And he passed on his love of music to you.
Yeah, I love it.
I know.
I know.
I can put on a movie for you.
Or whatever you want.
A glass of water?
Anything else? You can turn off the lamp.
Come, sit down.
Sure.
What's up?
You look anxious. Are you on something?
No way! Of course not.
You know your father, God rest his soul, and I made a promise, right?
Yes, Uncle.
And that means you can tell me anything.
About your dreams.
About girls.
I knew that was it.
What's her name?
-Who? -Don't be a dumbass.
-The chick we're talking about. -Oh, Claudia.
She called me "baby." She's the girl of my dreams.
And?
The only way I can get with her is if I give her a ride.
But Mom won't lend me her car.
If I don't give her a ride, the popular kids will,
then I won't have a date to the Christmas party
and I won't be able to experiment and I'll be a virgin forever--
Hold on. Calm down.
No one will beat you to it.
No one. All right?
You won't be a virgin forever.
I'll lend you my truck.
It's old, but it works well and it has a stereo.
Then you'll go to the party and experiment and whatever else.
The popular kids can suck it. Listen.
The one thing that pisses me off, like, really pisses me off,
to the point of my saying, "This really pisses me off,"
is giving advice.
If you want to know if she likes you, the next time you walk away from her,
If you want to know if she likes you, the next time you walk away from her, slyly turn around and see if she looks back at you.
slyly turn around and see if she looks back at you.
-That can't be true. -It never fails.
Aren't you listening? Think I'm an idiot?
-No. -Pay attention.
It never fails.
If the girl looks back at you, it means she wants you.
Here. The truck is yours.
Go on. -The rest is up to you. -Thanks a lot!
-The rest is up to you. -Thanks a lot!
All right, fuck off. I want to relax.
Tell me if you need anything.
-Thanks a lot! -Get out, damn it.
Oh baby. You'd really pick me up?
I'm going.
Fucking GPS.
I don't want this route. I want the easy one.
Recalculating.
What an asshole.
Come on.
I'm going!
-Shit! -Watch out!
-I'm sorry. -Fucking asshole!
-Get out of the way. -Move!
Recalculating.
Oh, here. Idiot.
Let's see.
What was the number?
-You've reached your destination. -Really?
Never again.
This is so fucking far.
Even if she's my dream girl--
Hold on, I'll get the door for you.
There.
Hi, baby.
Hi.
-Ready for your first day of school? -Ready.
Can we get a coffee at K'fe Club first?
I want to be a real city girl.
I always see the influencers with theirs.
First stop, K'fe Club.
K'FE CLUB ORGANIC COFFEE
That's 89 pesos.
Eighty-nine pesos?
I'll pay for it.
No way. It's my treat.
-Really? -Of course.
-Thanks. -Sure.
Here you go.
Thanks.
You'll get one every day.
You're the best.
How about some music?
That's my specialty.
-Really? -Let's see.
How embarrassing. Sorry.
Let's see.
These are my playlists. -Play whatever. -Okay.
-Play whatever. -Okay.
Weird. You don't have it.
Here it is.
My favorite, Mario B.
Don't you love M.B.?
"M.B."?
Yeah.
Oh yeah, I love him.
He's the best. The new Mozart.
Honestly, I'm used to nice things
I'm in a truck and I'm unprotected
The same people as always next to me
I'm Bautista and I've been baptized
And let there be
Let there be music
Today I'm toasting life
Friends, lovers, and family
We were just getting to the best bit.
Yeah, but we already listened to it like 100 times.
Shall we?
-Sure, let's go. -Let's go.
You gonna introduce us?
Another time.
-Hello. -Hi.
What?
What's up, friends?
This is Claudia.
She's new here. She's from Acapulco.
-Say hi. -Hi.
-Hi. -This is Hugo.
-Hi. -Hello.
-Rubén and Ana. -Hi.
-When did you get here? -About a week ago.
-Should I walk you to your class? -Sure.
See you later.
See you later.
Damn, she's hot.
I know, man.
-She's a juicy peach. -She smelled like pineapple.
You guys are idiots. Bye.
Hugo, come on.
What did I say?
It was a joke, Ana.
You said things too. Don't act like a saint.
I have your schedule with all your classes.
-I drew it out for you. Here it is. -Thank you.
I also brought you a notebook and a folder
in case you forgot yours because of first day jitters.
And the school's curriculum.
-Thanks. -I'll wait for you after every class.
-Don't leave with anyone else. -No way, baby.
Only with you.
Have a good day.
What's up with that chick?
You'll get in trouble.
-Come in. -Can we make an announcement?
Sure, go on.
Thanks.
-We've got big news. -Big.
Our graduation trip will be to…
Cancún!
I've never been to Cancún.
Calm down, everyone.
I know.
The plane, the hotel, and the parties are all included, so pay up now.
Now.
One more thing.
It's going to be epic.
Epic.
-I've been saving up for this for years. -Quiet.
Quiet!
Please don't forget,
this week are your college admissions guidance sessions.
It's a decision that will affect you forever.
I mean it. Forever.
Rubén, you're sure about literature, right?
Definitely, José María.
And you? Engineering, right?
-Well… -Hey.
What's with the Acapulco chick? So fucking hot!
Tell us. Where did you meet her?
-I told you, she's new. -Yeah, but why is she with you?
Why not?
-Did you see how she took my arm? -Yeah, I saw.
I'm sure she'll be my date to the Christmas party, and then Cancún.
I'm sure she'll be my date to the Christmas party, and then Cancún. So don't worry anymore.
What?
You're a dumbass.
If you take her to the Christmas party and Cancún,
I swear I'll give the principal oral.
She'll never forget it.
Give her what?
-What? -Give her what?
A spicy mango.
-"A spicy mango"? -Yes.
With chili, lime, and salsa.
To the principal's office.
Tell her what you want to do to her. Or prepare for her.
Principal's office.
Now.
Anyone else?
Hello, Chema.
-Hi. -What are you listening to?
"Rock the Casbah" by The Clash.
You and your British rock.
How did you know?
You told me once you only listen to British Rock,
and that you even have signed posters.
I actually have a poster of The Smiths signed by Morrissey.
-No! -Yes.
-Want to see it? -Sure.
That's so cool.
I love The Smiths.
It was my dad's.
That's cool.
Do you remember, when we were kids,
whenever our dads got drunk, they'd listen to Fobia?
Yes. Fobia.
There was this song--
-"Shake me." -"Shake me."
We could hang out some night and show each other bands we like.
Okay.
We could even apply to Your Hit together.
Sounds good.
-I'm sure we'll win. -For sure.
How about we start next week?
-Thursday? -Hell yeah.
Okay.
Hello.
Hi.
I'm Claudia.
I'm Eli.
Shall we go?
Bye.
I'll text you so you don't forget.
My first day of school was cool,
all thanks to you.
Do you like hot vinyasa?
-Sure. -Really?
Of course I like hot matcha.
And hot latte too.
And hot cakes and hot dogs.
Sweetie, what did you hear? I said "hot vinyasa."
Yoga.
I want to take some classes,
and some pole-dancing ones too.
Yes, I saw it on Instagram, but I don't have any way to get there.
With me.
Really?
-Yeah. -Really?
You're not busy in the afternoons?
Not at all.
Perfect.
I'll check the schedule,
and you'll do vinyasa with me, right?
Leave it.
-Really? -I'll throw it away.
Thanks, baby.
All right, bye.
I'll open it for you.
Such a gentleman.
Of course.
Thanks, Chema.
Okay.
See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
If you want to know if she likes you,
the next time you walk away from her,
slyly turn around and see if she looks back at you.
That can't be true.
It never fails.
Aren't you listening? Think I'm an idiot?
Pay attention.
If the girl looks back at you, it means she wants you.
Chema!
Are you okay, baby?
You pervert.
Drooling over a pair of legs.
Ever heard of #MeToo?
I wasn't drooling over anything.
It's okay, baby.
I wasn't looking at your legs. I swear.
So you always just have that desperate look on your face?
What desperate look?
My sexy baby.
I've been thinking about you all day.
I can't, babe.
I'm sorry.
I'm so full. I ate so much.
Mom, I know. Can we eat at the poke place tomorrow?
-Good idea, honey. -What's that?
Poke, Uncle.
It's like sushi, but it's in a bowl.
It's all over Instagram.
Speaking of bowls, I'm going to the bathroom.
In my room. I'll be right back.
So funny. Make yourself at home.
Thanks, Gloria.
Yes. Exactly what I needed.
I'm about to go in my pants.
-No! -What the fuck?
Shit.
"What the fuck?"
Fuck him for not knocking.
Oh well.
Tomorrow's another day with Claudia.
Fuck.
Recalculating.
Pass me!
We have good vibes
M.B.!
Mario B!
No.
This is Hanna and Alexa.
Hello, again.
-Want a sandwich? -So delicious.
-No. Don't. -No?
Dude.
I'M HERE. I'M UPSTAIRS. LOOK WHO I RAN INTO.
WHERE ARE YOU?
I'M SORRY, ELI, BUT
Good.
Very good.
GRADUATION TRIP SAVINGS
Fuck.
-It was super cool. -Yeah?
I did yoga, Pilates.
A body like this takes work.
Chema!
-Come here. -Hi, Claudia.
This is Sebas and Tomás.
I think we know each other. Hi.
Hi, Sebas.
What's up, dog?
What's up?
Then my instructor said I might get to meet Mario B.
-Mario B? -Yes.
Wow! Mario B!
Wow.
So exciting.
-All right, we have to go. -Bye.
Bye.
-Bye. Have a nice day. -Hold on, man.
I'm having people over Friday.
A chill house party.
Bring Claudia.
-All right. -And…
If you want, you can bring your bros.
-Your friends. -All right.
-See you, dog. -See you, Sebas.
"Dawg."
What happened? What'd he say?
Get ready for a chill house party at Sebas's place.
To the max!
He's looking.
See you later.
-We'll be in touch. -I'll send you a message.
-Can I come in? -Yes.
I knocked. I didn't catch you working out, did I?
No, it's hidden away.
Good.
Look at you.
So fucking handsome.
It's my first party with the popular kids.
And with the one and only Claudia.
All right!
Then I got here just in time.
-Come here. -I'm on my way out, Uncle.
-Two minutes. Sit down. -Okay.
-Fuck. -Yeah.
-Chema. -Yes?
Aside from the promise I made your father, God rest his soul,
I'm here for all of you,
for whatever you need. Anything. Got it?
-I know, thank you. -Hold on. What's the rush?
I know times have changed,
and that K'fe Club is cool.
I got you something.
I know you can find whatever on those cell phones today, but here.
There's nothing like jerking off the old-fashioned way.
If you're curious about the female body--
-No. Let's put these away. -Don't think I'm out of touch.
I also got you the latest sex toy.
-The Pocket Pussy. -No. Put that away.
Relax. Look, feel it--
No!
Don't be scared. It doesn't bite.
It even talks.
"I want to fuck you."
Stop it.
Come on.
It feels good. Feel the texture.
It feels like--
-See? -You're right.
-Don't get too excited now though. -No. That's enough. Put it away.
Fine. One last thing.
Listen up. This is important.
-Don't let her hug you. -What?
Why not?
Look, Chema.
The one thing that pisses me off, like, really pisses me off,
to the point of my saying, "This really pisses me off,"
is giving advice.
But if the chick hugs you,
forget it.
What's wrong with a hug?
Couples hug all the time.
Look, Chema.
Think what you want.
But if a chick hugs you, it's over.
There's no helping it.
You'll be nothing more than a friend.
No, you haven't seen us.
Claudia and I are much more than that.
We're much more than friends.
"The Sweetie."
Excessively naive.
So much so that he thinks he can be more than a friend
with the unattainable girl of his dreams.
Drink up.
-You said we'd never be invited again. -They invited Chema.
I don't get why I couldn't invite Ana.
I'm not talking to any other girls.
They won't talk to you.
In contrast, this star forward is ready to score.
Please don't go all horndog on us again.
That was one time.
-And you, Chema? -What?
Who's your date to the Christmas party? Not Claudia, surely?
Yeah, her. Who else would it be?
This guy.
Chema, who is Claudia to you?
Your friend?
No, we're much more than that.
Fine, your best female friend.
-Yes. Well, no. Something like that. -No, dude.
That's the worst thing possible.
It's like scoring in your own net at the 90-minute mark.
At the very last minute, in the final round.
You don't understand.
You really think we can't be a couple? You haven't seen us together.
Honestly, no.
As your friend.
Listen.
You should go to the Christmas party with a girl you have a connection with.
-Things in common. -We have a lot in common.
Sure, I believe you.
But, like what?
Like…
For example…
Listen, assholes, Claudia and I will be a couple.
You'll see.
Hello, Chema.
-Hi. -Want a mango shot?
No, I don't like them.
-You're kidding. -Really?
Okay, thanks.
-Bottoms up. -Yeah! Bottoms up!
Bottoms up.
Was there any mango in it?
What's up with Claudia? Is she into Sebas?
I don't know. Excuse me.
Poor sweetie.
Yes, poor sweetie.
-Come here, baby. -Hi, Claudia.
-Shot. -No!
More. Drink it all.
-You're hammered. Let's get water. -No.
-I'm going to steal him. -Okay.
Come on, man.
-I wanted to ask you something. -What's up?
What do you know about Claudia? I'm really into her.
I don't know.
Does she have a boyfriend in Acapulco?
What do you know?
Do you know or not?
Yes, I do.
She's a lesbian.
A lesbian?
Yeah.
What? No, she isn't.
I'm not lying.
She's super lesbian.
Look.
Super lesbian.
I thought we had a connection.
-I don't think so. -Well, thanks, dog.
Anytime.
Excuse us.
Come.
What?
Baby, I'm shit-faced, and Sebas wants to come back to my place.
-What? -I told him yes.
What? When was this?
-A while back. -No.
Can you believe it? So exciting.
PICK YOUR RIDE
Follow me.
-Where? -To get some air.
-Where? What are you doing? No. -Let's get some air.
Come on, please.
Wow.
All right, Claudia.
You're safe and sound. I'm leaving.
Hold on.
Baby.
Can you do me a favor?
Does it fit?
Not exactly.
Not exactly. It's a bit tight.
If you don't want to sleep in my bed, that's fine.
I'll get you some pillows and sheets.
I'll sleep with you!
I won't make you get pillows and sheets.
Thanks, baby. You're so sweet.
You know what?
I hate that my parents always go to Acapulco to visit my grandparents
and leave me here alone.
But I don't want to miss the parties.
No.
This is my favorite part. Let's dance.
You're my life
I'll wait for you to come back to me
Give me one more kiss
I just want one more kiss
If you leave me
I'll never forget you
Come here.
-Baby. -Uh-huh?
Give me a kiss.
"The Failure."
A person who screws up, misses,
and freezes at the slightest intimate interaction with a girl.
Hey Siri.
Yes?
How do I French kiss?
To French kiss, freshen your breath,
tilt your head, close your eyes, and stick out your tongue--
Baby!
I'm traumatized.
Why? What happened?
There's nothing from Sebas.
Nothing. No likes, no messages, no comments.
I don't get it. We had a great time last night.
He said he'd bring me home.
But you brought me home.
You were really drunk.
Don't you remember? You said you wanted to go home.
And I left the party and brought you home so you wouldn't be alone.
You don't remember?
And Claudia, just between us,
you're too good for Sebas.
He's a fuckboy.
You should be with someone more…
like,
different.
-You get what I mean? -Oh, baby.
I love you!
Don't let her hug you.
Why are you pushing me away? What's wrong?
Come here.
Hug me.
"Friends."
Can I tell you something?
You're my best friend.
Damn.
Damn. This is going to be so good.
You've never done this with the napkins before.
So? It makes the table look nice.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
You won't help me set the table,
and you won't let me watch the show your uncle suggested.
I wanted to talk to you about him.
About him renting the apartment next door?
What?
He has work in the city and wants his own place.
Yeah, he has been here awhile.
But it's not that.
Well, it's kind of related.
Listen, Mom,
who's Uncle Jaime to you?
What?
What would happen if he felt something for you?
Stop talking nonsense.
He's like my brother.
But what if he wanted something more?
I don't know, like…
a relationship.
A relationship? Are you crazy?
Come on. What would he need to do to make you see him differently?
Nothing. It's impossible.
Impossible?
Why are you asking me this? What's up?
I'm hanging out with a girl.
That girl Claudia?
Tell me everything.
She's my dream girl.
You should see her. She's amazing.
-She sounds great. -So great.
She's from Acapulco.
She's so tanned.
And her accent…
She does yoga and pole dancing.
Pole dancing! You should see her spin.
Pole dancing?
Okay.
I thought you were into girls like Eli who you share interests with, like music.
-But Eli is like my cousin. -She's not your cousin.
When you were little, they called us "Auntie" and "Uncle" to be nice.
But you're not cousins.
I knew it.
But that's not the point.
Claudia wants to be with me.
-Sometimes she's a bit weird-- -No!
What?
-No, sweetie. -No, what? Tell us.
-What? -What's wrong?
-What's going on? -Sweetie.
Chema, you're her dog.
Yeah, "dawg."
Sebas calls me "dawg" too.
Oh my God. No, Chema.
It's not "dawg" with a "w."
It's "dog" with an "o."
As in, you're her lapdog.
Dog with an "o."
The exclusive human pet of a super-hot girl.
A dog will never have any chance of sexual contact
with the girl of his dreams.
That's what a dog with an "o" is.
Darling, Chema.
Leave him.
-Why did you tell him that? -Because it's a fact.
You'd rather he stay in love with her? Poor thing.
Stop speaking English already!
"Dog."
Who are you dreaming of?
I HAD A DREAM THAT YOU WERE MINE
What?
Who are you dreaming of?
No one.
The Christmas party is coming up.
Do you have a date? I bet you do.
Do you really care?
Of course. Why wouldn't I?
You stood me up.
And now you care who I'm going with?
I'm sorry. I wanted to go, but that day--
It's fine.
No, it's not fine.
I want to apply with you.
The auditions are over.
Shit.
Really?
I'm sorry.
I'm an idiot.
Lately, that's all I am.
I'm sorry, Eli.
Chema.
Don't worry.
Seriously.
Why not?
It was awful.
Yeah, but it's in the past.
AMORES PERROS
What? You've never seen Amores Perros?
Unbelievable. It's my favorite movie.
You really have a lot to learn.
-Really? -Yeah.
About what?
Movies.
Claudia, I have a question for you.
-Everything all right, baby? -No.
I figured out why they're calling me that nickname.
Do you also think--
Honestly, I do.
-You think I'm-- -Yes.
You could be my date to the Christmas party.
I've thought about it.
I was dying to go with Sebas, but he's ignoring me.
So I think it's best if we go together.
I have to go, no matter what.
The Christmas party? You and me?
Yes, baby. Aren't you listening?
You and me?
CANCÚN
I bought my ticket for Cancún.
-You said it wouldn't happen, asshole. -What?
You're looking at the guy who's taking Claudia Galeana to the Christmas party.
Yeah right, man.
What are you doing?
I swear to you.
Do you remember what you said?
-About what? -About Eli being out of my league.
What about Eli?
I'm not saying anything about Eli.
I was telling Hugo I'm taking Claudia to the Christmas party.
Congratulations.
Eli's going with Toño Bravo, if you were wondering.
I have to go see my history teacher.
All right, my little egg.
Little egg.
I'll see you later, right?
"Little egg"?
-What? -Hold on.
Eli's going with Toño?
-Emoji Face? -Yeah.
It makes a lot of sense.
-They won Your Hit together. -Yeah.
-Emoji Face is playing his shitty music? -Don't get so upset.
I'm not upset. What are you talking about?
I don't give a shit about Your Hit or who Eli is going with.
I love you!
This is historic. Best fuckboy ever.
Best fuckboy ever.
He gets you wetter than a category-five hurricane.
Alexa, how would you know?
But you're so fucking lucky.
-Did Sebas ask you? -Ask me what?
To the Christmas party.
Yeah, the Christmas party.
He's gonna ask me?
No. Really?
I thought he wasn't going to ask me,
so I'm going with Chema.
What the fuck?
No. Look, this is serious. Alexa.
No.
Your date is the person you give yourself to,
and make out with, and fuck.
Fact!
You should never go to the really wild parties with your dog.
Never.
-My what? -No way.
You don't know?
Your dog.
With an "o."
Your human pet. Your lapdog.
Your lapdog.
As in, "Treat them like dogs, and they follow you like dogs."
Chema is your dog.
All the most popular kids,
like me,
like us,
we all have a dog with an "o."
Mine is Manny. Watch.
Manny!
Perfect. You look like a queen.
I know.
Manny does my glam because he's incredible.
But keep it quiet. If he gets famous, he'll stop being my dog.
Mine is Fer.
Fer!
No, nothing.
Do some more push-ups, okay?
Don't do that.
They're our dogs, but it's for a good cause.
Alexa helps Fer lose weight, and I'm Manny's muse.
Get the point? Chema's your dog, not your guy.
Need either of these?
Okay.
See you after class.
You're welcome.
When are we racing? Or are you not allowed?
-See you tomorrow. -All right, bro.
Shit! Claudia.
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?
It's a trick I know.
Here's another one.
Sorry.
Sorry, but Chema told me that--
I don't care what my dog told you.
I want you right now.
Me too.
Let's go to my house.
All right.
Voicemail. The call--
Sir.
You're sure you didn't see who Claudia left with?
Please remember.
Listen.
If I tell you "no" one more time,
will you get out of here and let me close the school?
Listen to me!
It's the same thing every weekend.
I warned you.
You knew I'd be going back a lot if we moved here.
We're worried about you. Everyone's had sex except you.
You need contact.
Experiment.
I hope that's what you're doing in your lives.
Fuck.
Ms. Cholita?
Honey!
Are you in your room?
Yes!
I'm coming, Mom!
No, I'll come up.
Done.
What would I do without you, Jaime?
Now you can watch TV from the couch, the kitchen, the dining table.
Wherever you want.
Drink your coffee before it gets cold.
Yeah. I hadn't forgotten.
There's nothing better for a hangover than Gloria's famous spiced coffee.
There's no one like you.
The secret to good coffee is making it with love.
-Well, I-- -It's starting.
It's getting good.
Yeah.
I know you've only ever seen me as a friend,
but for years,
I've been secretly in love with you.
Oscar, I must confess that I've always liked you.
But we can't be together.
I know, but we can't waste any more time.
It's not fair!
-Because I love you. -Jaime.
Gloria.
Just like Oscar,
I also want to tell you--
José María.
Did you get robbed?
I wish.
Leave him. Let me handle it.
Chema?
What the fuck? Are you going to tell me what happened?
Claudia was with another guy.
Great. That explains it.
That's why you're hunched over like a sad cat.
That's why. Claudia left me for another guy.
One of the popular kids.
Come, sit down.
This Claudia chick has every right to have other friends.
They aren't friends.
That's not what friends do.
Now I get it.
Look, Chema,
women like to compare men to see which one they like most,
and I'm sure that in this case, it's you.
Isn't she your date for the party?
It's her. Look.
Go on, answer it.
Seduce her.
That's it, champ!
That's my fucking nephew.
Baby, why are your clothes in my room?
What? I don't know what you're talking about.
Baby, all your clothes have your name embroidered on them.
Whatever, baby.
We're best friends, right?
I have a confession to make.
I never stopped hoping that Sebas would be my date to the Christmas party,
and he asked me.
Sorry.
Baby?
Don't worry about it.
It's fine, honestly.
But I'll obviously help you find a date--
No! I actually wanted to go with someone else.
What? Really?
Who?
Yeah.
With Eli.
Remember her?
Obviously. The pretty girl who's crazy about you.
Eli's not crazy about me.
The girl that loves music? She's obviously crazy about you.
You think I didn't notice?
I have to go, baby. Bye.
RU, IS ELI DEFINITELY GOING TO THE PARTY WITH EMOJI FACE?
I'm getting some food. Want anything?
No, thanks.
I'll be back.
This is so cool.
What's up?
This is awesome.
Right?
Congratulations.
And congratulations on Toño Bravo.
Well, someone else I know--
Don't even start.
You're starting in January?
Yeah, but we're getting everything ready.
Cool.
A little birdie told me you've turned down a few guys.
You're not going to the party?
I don't think it's my scene.
And if by chance,
by some tiny chance,
we went together,
you and me,
would that be your scene?
-You're not going with Claudia? -Claudia? No.
No way.
That's what I heard.
That's strange.
It didn't even cross my mind.
So,
do you want to be my date?
Motherfucker.
Look at you.
Kids get all dressed up for Christmas parties these days.
The invitation said "gala cool."
You're wearing your dad's jacket.
You look just like him. I'm going to cry.
My mom got all excited, but it looks like shit on me.
It doesn't look like shit.
It looks awesome.
In fact, I think it will bring you luck with Claudia.
-I told you I'm not going with her. -Yeah, I know.
But hope dies last.
Tell her how you feel, damn it.
Seize the moment,
and if things happen to get going,
and you're both getting hot and bothered,
look what I bought you.
XL
They're your size. I saw that monster between your legs.
You don't knock.
No. I'm a free man.
I thought that fucking animal would bite me. Put a leash on it.
Fuck.
I love you, Uncle.
I love you a lot.
Shit.
I love you too, son.
A shit ton.
Enough.
Look at how I get with all this hugging.
It'll make me--
Hey, motherfuckers!
Let's go!
I'm going.
Have fun.
-Thanks for the little-- the big present. -Take care.
-Come on. We're late! -Wow, guys.
Look at how you've grown.
-We'll bring him home early. -We don't want him. Keep him.
Shit, Hugo!
-Cheers. -Bye, Uncle!
-Let's go. -Don't do anything stupid!
Well, not too stupid.
Cheers!
I told you it would be the shit.
-Come on. -Yeah.
Giddy-up!
-I have a little something for you. -No way.
My mom says they bring good luck.
-It's super cool. -Today is going to rock.
-Thanks, brother. -Thanks.
To the max!
I love you guys.
Tonight will be awesome now that we're getting laid.
Fucking awesome.
So you finally accepted it was never going to happen with Claudia?
Honestly, I prefer Eli over Claudia any day.
Yeah, sure.
Chema doesn't care.
He's like Jon Snow when he was on the boat with Daenerys.
Wow, yeah.
Getting some loving with his cousin.
She's not my cousin!
Stop saying that.
Why don't you pay up for the limo?
Seriously?
-We're going to pay you. -Pay up.
I'll make a transfer.
-You're kidding. -Again?
I don't have it on me.
Enough.
-To the best night of our lives. -Hell yeah.
Come on, man.
Cheers.
What'll you have?
Chema? What do you want to drink?
A beer.
Two beers.
Chema.
I want to show you something.
What's this?
In junior high, Ana and I predicted the future,
and I said I'd go to the Christmas party with you.
I found it last night in a drawer. Can you believe it?
Since junior high?
I'm glad it finally happened.
Cheers.
How's everyone feeling at the party you've all been waiting for?
-Come on! -Shots.
One, two, three.
To the max!
Total bullshit, man.
Lesbian? Sure.
-What's wrong? -Nothing.
-Another one? -Yeah.
Okay.
What are we toasting?
The fact I only have this much fun with you.
Me too.
Cheers.
"Shake me"!
I can't believe it!
-I'm sure no one knows it. -Absolutely no one.
Except you and me.
You and me.
Baby?
What is it, Claudia?
Sorry, am I interrupting something?
Yes.
I really need to talk to you.
I'm busy. I'm with Eli.
I can see that.
But it's urgent.
Please.
Eli, can I borrow him?
It's up to Chema, not me.
Go. I have to go to the bathroom anyway.
Thanks, Eli.
Shall we, baby?
Let's go.
What do you want?
I don't know.
I got jealous seeing you with Eli.
-It made me want to be with you. -What?
I came with Eli because you rejected me.
And you forgot about me that fast?
What? The only thing I wanted was for us to--
for us to be a couple.
Really, baby?
You and me? A couple?
What's up?
Can you imagine me and Chema together?
Don't be an idiot.
I just thought it might happen.
A couple?
Thanks for taking care of my girlfriend, dog. Let's go.
Did he really say that?
I was your second choice?
I swear you weren't.
-How disappointing. -Eli.
It's you I enjoy being with.
I heard everything you just said!
-Please. -You're the worst guy on the planet.
And I'm an idiot.
-There's nothing between me and Claudia. -Leave her!
What's up, Jon Snow?
Did you hear the after party is at my place?
What's wrong?
No way.
All this hassle just to end the night jerking off again.
I don't care about getting laid. You're just a horndog!
-It was one time. -I'm sick of your fucking jokes!
I'm sick of you, always up on your high horse,
thinking your shit don't stink.
So indecisive, and now you have nobody.
You know what?
You and Rubén can go fuck yourselves.
As long as it's with a friend.
Asshole.
Then I got trashed, big time.
Let the music play
Until it heals these wounds
Bring me more tequila, please
I love you, Mario B!
What?
-Give me the bottle. You're hammered. -So what?
Oh, yeah, this is where we left off.
Let's continue.
Damn!
Look at you.
Let me help you.
Damn.
I was getting ready to go to the gym,
I heard a thud and look who I found.
Look at those hickeys.
Was the party a success?
Yes.
A total success in my dad's '90s jacket that I look awesome in, right?
Look, son.
The one thing that pisses me off, like, really pisses me off,
to the point of my saying, "This really pisses me off,"
is giving advice.
If it pisses you off so much, stop giving it.
Calm down. What happened?
You know you can tell me anything.
-That's what uncles are for. -No, you're not my uncle.
Just like Eli isn't my cousin.
You say you moved here for "business,"
but I know what your real business is.
It's to fuck my mom.
But guess what?
My mom doesn't want you.
You know why?
Because you're her dog,
with an "o."
Just like me, a lapdog.
A dog like me!
Treat them like dogs, and they'll follow you like dogs.
"My dear Gloria, I'm going home, where I belong."
"I won't bother you anymore."
"Thank you for the kindness you showed me."
"You'll always be in my heart."
"All my love to you, Begoña, and Chema."
"Jaime."
He left it with the car keys.
He's gone.
What's going on?
I called him but he's not answering.
I don't understand!
Your voice is at 120 decibels. My head is exploding.
Of course it is! You drank too much last night!
You know what? Get up, you lazy bum!
Fuck.
CALLING UNCLE JAIME
Voicemail. You will be charged after the tone.
CALLING ELI
ELI, I HAVE NO WORDS. I AM THE WORST GUY ON THE PLANET.
I DON'T DESERVE YOU. I'M SORRY.
I'm an idiot.
I'm an idiot.
Did I yell, "I love you, Mario B"?
Eli, can we talk?
No.
Give me five minutes, please.
Let me explain. I really fucked everything up.
Chema! Leave me alone.
UNIVERSITY APPLICATION FIRST CHOICE: ENGINEERING
Thanks.
Good luck.
What's up?
Oh no!
Come here.
Mom?
Mom?
Do we have any ribbon?
I don't know.
Mom?
What is it?
What's wrong?
I miss Jaime.
I said it.
There, I said it.
Mom.
-About Uncle Jaime-- -No.
I should be the one to talk.
We never told each other how we felt. We just stayed quiet.
You graduate this week.
Your father would be very proud of you.
And I'm even prouder.
I've realized we can't wait for tomorrow to do and say what we feel.
It's today.
Follow your heart, my dear.
I love you with all my heart.
I love you.
I love you too.
Uncle, I promise this is the last time I'll write you.
I never told you the whole story.
I know, I really fucked up.
I thought singing Mario Bautista and passing out onto a condom
I thought singing Mario Bautista and passing out onto a condom was rock bottom.
And that's everything.
I took it all out on the person watching over us.
Isn't it ironic?
I'm graduating, and I can't imagine it without you.
I told you I missed you,
but, honestly, we all do.
I love you very much.
Chema, my softie.
-Could you help me with-- -Sorry, but I'm no softie.
-What's up? -Hey.
-Someone left this for you. -Thanks.
ROCK FROM ARGENTINA, FRANCE, JAPAN, USA, MEXICO
HAMILTON SANG "I DREAMED YOU WERE MINE A THOUSAND TIMES"
I DREAMED IT MORE CHEMA
I'll be back.
Go long.
Fer.
Manny.
Manny, no.
-I'm sick of this. -Give me that, fucking dog.
No, let me speak.
What you're doing is wrong.
Are you happy like this?
Aren't you enough?
Because I wasn't.
I thought if I went to a stupid party…
if I was with a hot girl,
my life would be better.
But it's the opposite.
I lost my best friends.
And I lost the coolest girl in the world.
Manny.
Manny, you're an artist.
Look at Hanna.
You're gonna be huge.
And you, Fer,
you're the smartest guy in the whole school.
Who wouldn't want to get know you?
Who wouldn't want to befriend you?
Who wouldn't want to be with you?
We have to stop this.
No one
is anyone's lapdog.
No one
is anyone's dog!
Because we are enough.
That's right, brother!
Awesome!
Very good, Chema.
Love you!
So much!
Graduates, take your seats, please.
Your families are about to enter.
The ceremony is about to begin.
-Did you go on a-- -A cruise?
A cruise?
Not me.
But the idea of being in the middle of nowhere…
-Chema. -What's up?
I broke up with Sebas for you.
We weren't getting along anyway.
I swear you were never my dog.
I swear.
I want us to be together.
What?
No, Claudia.
What do you mean?
-Isn't that what you always wanted? -Yes, but…
but no.
Actually, no.
I didn't know what I wanted.
But now I do.
And it's mostly thanks to you.
But we can be friends.
Best friends.
All right?
-Hi. -Hi.
-Thanks. -Excuse me.
-Come on, Fer. -Hi.
Thanks.
Did you listen to it?
Bros, I'm sorry.
-I really fucked up. -No, Chema.
I was a bad friend.
I'm sorry.
But you never lost me.
-We're brothers. -We're brothers.
So cheesy.
I'm sorry, man.
-I'm sorry. -Don't say it.
I love you, bro.
Me too.
To the max!
Ready for university?
They say the chicks are smoking.
Yeah, they're smoking,
and they'll put you in jail for being such a horndog.
-It was one time. Let it go. -I hope I'll get lucky there.
Of course you will.
It's no big deal you didn't have sex. It doesn't always happen.
What? At the party, you and Pili--
-She narrowly escaped. -No, she didn't.
We were at my house, ready to do it when--
When what?
I don't know. It just didn't feel right.
We were both totally wasted.
That's cool.
Awesome, man.
I'm proud of you, bro.
You should hear about these two sex animals.
Ana and you are sex animals?
-Have you heard of furries? -No, what's that?
It's about to start.
Let the ceremony begin.
I'd like to thank you all for coming on this very emotional day.
It seems like only yesterday we saw these little pups arrive,
and now we're saying goodbye.
Thank you for being here.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Good luck.
Alexa Camargo.
-Alexa. -Thanks, teach.
Congratulations.
José María Cervantes.
-Thanks. -Well done, Chema.
Miss.
Iván Durán.
Well done, son!
Bravo!
-Uncle! -Well done!
Hey, motherfuckers!
Uncle!
Sebastián Echeverría.
My uncle's here. No way.
Let's get a picture.
Let's do it.
Come on.
-Ready? -Yeah.
Come on.
Emanuel Ibarra.
Buddy.
Come with us to Cancún. It won't be the same without you.
What? You're not going to Cancún?
-I'm going to find my parents. -Yeah.
I spent all my savings on a few gifts.
Thanks, Chema.
Your vinyl,
I'm dying to hear it, Mr. International.
But I can't take your poster.
Yes, you can.
I want you to have it.
Eli.
-They're calling you. -I have to go.
Uncle.
You son of a bitch.
Damn.
Congratulations.
I love you.
Son.
-Your present. -Wow.
-What's this? -Here's some advice I'm happy to give you.
Celebrate. Fucking celebrate.
You don't graduate every day.
Thanks, Uncle.
Guess what?
I didn't choose engineering.
Really?
Why not?
I'm going to study music.
I'm even prouder.
And in your father's jacket.
I don't know what you did to it, but now it looks cool.
Yeah.
Since I'm already crying, I have something to tell you all.
This time, I'm not just here to visit.
I brought all my shit.
-Your shit? -My things.
My belongings.
My stuff, Begoña.
That's awesome.
I want to be close to you.
Always.
I love you all.
Such crybabies.
So, this was your fantasy?
Excuse me?
Only one person at a time.
And this is for first class.
Come on, bro.
-Don't stop. -No?
-Don't stop. -Okay.
Please, dude.
Almost there?
Mario B?
Go for it, bro.
This really is first class.
"The Dawg."
Considered superior by the female of the species,
who all dream of having one.
His origins are unknown, but rumor has it
This was meant to sound like a confession?
Had it been addressed to me...
if I'd been the object of your moans, pardon me, sighs...
I'd make sure we'd never meet again.
Take my advice and find something else in life,
something you can actually do.
Because you surely can't... sing.
You're a washout.

Next week, a special bonus edition of our show in which head of jury Olo Zawistowski
in which head of jury Olo Zawistowski will face his past.
Our musical cruise will visit Olo's hometown, Rozalin.
-Music Race, a race to the stars! -Wake me up! I'm not dreaming!
Ostra, what's wrong?
-Music Race crap! -What?
A moronic show for morons, with morons!
The show's not going to Rozalin, get it?
-Olo, relax. -I'm not going back to that shithole.
Not a shithole. Olo's coming home. It's moving.
Not a shithole. Olo's coming home. It's moving. Home, to a small town, one of a thousand.
Olo comes closer to Joe Sixpack, gaining in popularity.
I don't need more fans.
If it hadn't been for me, no one would know you outside of the dinner circuit.
I know TV is a drag, the camera adds ten kilos. I'll take you fishing and you'll chill.
the camera adds ten kilos. I'll take you fishing and you'll chill.
But a deal is a deal, right? And what was the deal?
The deal was that we do the show,
get ratings that go through the roof.
My show on my terms, right?
And then we do your album.
On your terms.
You'll be an artist all you want then.
Listening to that stuff... with your family.
You prick!
What's up?
-Where are you? -I'm coming.
-Where are you? -I'm coming. -Which hashtag for Rozalin sounds better-- -What?
-Which hashtag for Rozalin sounds better-- -What?
Olo returns, Olo's return, Olo's back--
"God-Olo-mighty's back!"
Brilliant, right? Olo?
Hello?
-You two should meet and talk. -Why?
-You've got a kid with him. -I told him 18 years ago.
When he was wasted and puked all over his mic.
-Mom! -They all puke on their mics.
You should've sued him for alimony, maybe he'd sober up.
You should've sued him for alimony, maybe he'd sober up. Mom!
He's getting old, sentimental.
He's getting old, sentimental. He wants to face his past, he said so himself!
He wants to face his past, he said so himself!
-He didn't. -All right, the host said it.
But if he's such a total jerk,
But if he's such a total jerk, would he agree to come to this dump?
would he agree to come to this dump?
He wants to get in touch with you!
So I'm to come up and say, "Excuse me, we have a kid?"
And why not?
Do you know how much he makes on that TV show?
-I don't want his money! -I don't want his money!
Hungry?
You should invite him for dinner. I read he likes Silesian dumplings.
-Marta likes them too. -Grandma!
And if he denies it, we'll check his DNA.
-From his saliva. -How?
We'll sample a dumpling. I read about it.
How about you ask me if I want to meet him?
Do you?
No. And no.
See? She doesn't want it.
And I have a feeling she does.
Very much.
-You drew this for him, remember? -Burn it.
He never got it.
-Maybe Grandma's right. -I don't want his money!
-Maybe Grandma's right. -I don't want his money! This is not about money.
He's your father.
He's an asshole who left you with a brat.
But thanks to him, I've got this brat...
who, at times, is a likable brat.
-He was talented, he had to leave. -Don't defend him, it's useless!
I just want you to be happy.
I'll be happy when you're happy.
DAD
And now Olo Zawistowski's hit, "Dark Night"!
Olo...
Eyes on the GPS.
Turn left in 200 meters.
But the road to the center was... there.
You really are a hillbilly. We could've taken a train.
To have 200 people singing "Dark Night"? No thanks.
Maybe you should write something new.
Why are you so nervous?
Do you owe people money there?
You dumped some ho back there.
And you don't want to see her.
Yep. She's old and fat, and works at a supermarket.
You don't have to, if you don't want to.
I don't want to, but you have to.
Let's go home?
-Morning! -Hello!
Can't hear you, I'll call you back, bye.
Yes?
-Hello. -And bye. No tag, no entry.
You go in, just be visible. Everything all right? All hyped? Great.
-I work there... -Mom is a teacher.
School's out today. Go on, please. This is a film set.
-Yes, but we came to see Olo! -Sure. Everyone wants to see him.
Excuse me, could you stop
fiddling with that mandolin? Thanks.
-It's a ukulele. -Stop fiddling with the "ulele."
-How can I get this tag? -You're auditioning?
-Right. -Fill this out and sign it.
Hello?
Sixty-eight and 69... next please, great.
And the next five get ready. Watch your place in line.
I'll call you on my break, if I have one. Pen. Great, bye.
Cool. Rock on!
-Tag... -Thanks.
Hold it!
It's five at a time, as they come.
I'd say no sooner than... 4:00 p.m.
Let's go.
Ostrowicz.
-Through here? -Come on, Mom!
Faculty entering through the basement?
Catch!
-Ready? -How do I look?
Gorgeous!
Olo!
Oh, God!
Can I take a pic?
Got it? Hey!
Got it? Hey! You're crazy!
-One more. -Go ahead.
Remember me?
No!
Excuse me.
Stop. No tag, no entry.
-I have to get in. -Tag.
Excuse me!
-How many calories will you burn? -How many should I burn?
We need the host on set!
-They're calling me. -Is something wrong?
Krzysztof... what is it? I work out!
-So handsome. And forever young. -True.
Camera on him.
Thanks for the warm welcome. It's me, Krzysztof, your younger buddy!
That's a good one!
-And that smile! -True!
-Wait... -Mom!
-Marta Ostrowicz, what are you-- -Hello.
Hello. I'll tell your mom--
First and foremost, hello...
First and foremost, hello... Rozalin!
You're on first.
Excuse me.
One of the most distinguished jazz singers in the world:
Urszula Dudziak!
Also, the girl you love.
Her social media is followed by half a million people:
Ewa "Eva" Dykty!
And last but not least, the man behind "Dark Night,"
head of the jury,
graduate of your school...
Let's welcome the jerk, pig and clown...
-Got this? -You bet.
You're an idiot, a moron,
a jerk, a dimwit!
Get her out of here!
You're a washout!
-Let go of me! -Didn't expect that from a local!
-Nothing! -Hashtag jerk.
-Nothing! -Hashtag jerk. Hashtag pigandmoron.
Hashtag pigandmoron.
Hashtag crazyrozalinchick...
There will be consequences.
She'll fail. She will!
-Way to go! Great stuff! Did you get it? -You bet.
The principal called. A staff meeting was called to discuss your case.
You're an idiot, a moron, a jerk, a dimwit!
SHE'S AN IDIOT HA HA STUPID COW
You're a washout!
UGLY TOO SHAME HER PARENTS FUCKED UP
SHAME HER PARENTS FUCKED UP
OMG SHE'S SO UGLY
ANOREXIC
SO FUCKED-UP
-Ostra, you're a washout. -Pathetic.
I knew she was an embarrassment.
You suck so bad your pics are liked only by your mom, grandma and this fool.
My mom should expel you. And your mother.
Even your old man ran from you. Or maybe you're a test tube kid?
-Psycho! -Let me go!
-Psycho! -Let me go! Yelling at people, beating idiots? What's going on?
Yelling at people, beating idiots? What's going on?
-Beat it! -What?
Ostrowicz!
Where are you off to? I'll tell your mom!
What's going on?
OLO IS MY FATHER
Why haven't you told me?
You never asked.
-And you... -Did nothing.
-But he knew you were you. -He pretended he didn't recognize Mom.
Everyone has forgotten about him, and then he shows up,
Everyone has forgotten about him, and then he shows up, -ruins my life and kills my mother! -Oh, come on.
-ruins my life and kills my mother! -Oh, come on.
He treated her like shit. Stepped on her and went on his way.
-Wow... -If he was still creative, at least...
but he just soaks people in water. How pathetic.
Look at his wheels! He got a mil just for being in the show.
When he dies, you'll get all the royalties.
-I don't want his money! -What, then?
I'd squash him with a steamroller to see his guts!
You could afford one.
-Hello? -I'm calling from the TV show
-Hello? -I'm calling from the TV show with great news.
You have passed to the next stage of Music Race!
I'm calling to invite you to a live show, which--
Hello?
-Hello? -What did she say?
-Moo. -Moo?
-It was the Music Race. -What? Why?
-They want me on the live show. -The live show?
For months we've been looking for bold daredevils, but...
Personality, charisma and guts are not everything.
You have to be a singer too.
-But we don't need a... -A jerk, pig and clown...
Or hotheads, idiots, emotionally unstable teenagers.
Or hotheads, idiots, emotionally unstable teenagers. -You're a washout. -You're a washout!
-You're a washout. -You're a washout!
2.5 million views in less than two hours.
-Why am I not in it? -You are, later. Why so many?
Simple. The wacko from Rozalin.
-You set it all up, admit it. -Of course not.
-You set it all up, admit it. -Of course not. But I wish I had. Mela, who's on the show?
But I wish I had. Mela, who's on the show?
Franek, Zośka, Mrs. Krystyna, what's her name...
Me.
Boring!
Thanks, Andrzej.
No, not "Thanks, Andrzej"!
-Singing is not going to get us ratings. -But it's a singing show.
-Singing is not going to get us ratings. -But it's a singing show. Come on, my ass it is!
Come on, my ass it is!
I want that Rozalin wacko live!
-I don't believe this. -Believe it! I want a scandal, a fight!
"Boring" gets us off the air after the first season. Do you want that?
-No. -Right. No further questions.
But she didn't even sing.
Listen, let's take... Amelia.
Charisma: one, guts: one, singing: ten.
Rozalin Wacko: charisma: 10, guts: 10, singing: zero,
but as I see it, she's a total fame whore.
-And that's your idea for the show? -Why not?
-Congrats. -If she's such a fame whore,
maybe she'll sing something?
-And she'll suck at it. It'd be awesome! -It would.
Excuse me, but the Rozalin wacko is here. Should I get rid of her?
What did I tell you? Total fame whore.
I want this gone.
I'm helpless in this situation, miss.
You signed an agreement when you auditioned.
Besides, Olo doesn't waste such opportunities.
-Olo? -Right. It was his idea.
You threw water in his face and he's holding a grudge. Everyone is afraid of him here.
Except for me, of course.
So, I could try... talking to him.
You know... I'd like to offer you a deal.
A chance for revenge. On the show, live. Unedited.
You'd tell him whatever you want.
With millions of people watching.
Roast him.
Roast her, your style.
What'd you give her? What will she do?
You don't even have to sing "Dark Night."
Just destroy her, please.
It's going to be a big catch.
Maybe we shouldn't have sent her alone.
Not alone, with Antek.
-We could've-- -She wouldn't have listened.
-Hi, Małgosia. -Hey.
-Hi, Małgosia. -Hey. Sorry for the intrusion...
I wanted to talk, but not at school, -and not at home I guess... -You know...
-and not at home I guess... -You know... we're having... a family powwow, so...
we're having... a family powwow, so...
-You get it? -Sure.
-Okay. -Maybe tomorrow...
-What? Our coach? -Stop it.
There we go.
-No, I can't do it. -Stop it!
Relax, it'll be great.
What do they think about your talent? Urszula?
It wasn't good.
You're on. Stand on the marked spot and start singing.
But I don't sing.
I've got one thing to say to you: you're a washout.
-I can't. -What?
-I'll look like a fame whore. -Tell them how he ruined your life.
He deserves the hate, not you.
Listen... sometimes you need to take a risk
Listen... sometimes you need to take a risk or else you'll always regret that you didn't do something.
or else you'll always regret that you didn't do something.
-Go now! -I'm with you.
Jesus, it's her!
You're an idiot, a moron, a jerk...
Ostra lives in Rozalin, Olo's hometown.
Her first performance failed to charm the jury, but she got a second chance.
Let's see how she fares this time.
Very attached to your look, I see.
I wonder what you'll wear next time.
If you pass, that is.
Can I help you somehow?
Water, perhaps?
Can you talk?
Sing?
Or just insult people?
Harder, harder...
I guess she forgot how to do that too.
Maybe...
You matter
More than you realize
Maybe...
I want you more
Than anyone has ever wanted you
Maybe
You are
Someone easier to be
Maybe
You are a deafening silence That engulfs me
When I ask which way to go
That's exactly how This anxiety tastes
This anxiety tastes
And this fear
And when the day is done
You will calmly
Give your answer
That what I've got
Is not enough for you
What I've got
I could hide no more
Finally. Finally!
I believed in it like crazy
And what I've got
Was to be a world for you
What I've got
Is not enough for you
What I've got
I could hide no more
What I've got
I believed in it like crazy
And what I've got
Was to be a world for you
Clever girl!
Is she your girlfriend?
I don't know. I mean...
I had no idea she was a singer.
Let's see what the jury says. Urszula?
I know you can yell.
I don't know if you can talk.
But your singing is spectacular! It's a "yes!"
-Good job! -Great, Mother! Good for you.
Ewa?
-Wow! -Hashtag what?
Hashtag shock. Awesome!
-Olo, now you. -Give me Olo.
-Olo? -They're talking to you.
Keep the close-up, there'll be a reaction.
Olo?
You've got two votes, so you're staying.
Although I wasn't impressed.
Nevertheless, Ostra stays on the show!
The next contestant...
No... that was lame!
"Not impressed."
"Not impressed." -Let's welcome another fame-hungry... -Drink.
-Amelia! -All right.
-Amelia! -All right. She is from Wroclaw, and she has sung before...
She is from Wroclaw, and she has sung before...
-How is it that you can sing? -I don't know, I just do.
-How is it that you can sing? -I don't know, I just do. But like that? What else don't I know? Meryl Streep's your real mother?
But like that? What else don't I know? Meryl Streep's your real mother?
Stop! Where are you going?
Stop! Where are you going? -Home? -Sponsors' party. You have to be there.
-Home? -Sponsors' party. You have to be there.
We have to.
-We have to catch the last bus. -Do we?
You don't understand what just happened.
You're now under my wing. I'll take care of your whole career.
You're now under my wing. I'll take care of your whole career. And I'll start by introducing you to some big names.
All food and accommodations are on me. Full exclusive.
All food and accommodations are on me. Full exclusive. -Awesome. -Ciao.
-No way. -Ostra!
It's my first time in Warsaw. The only trips I take involve sleeping in a tent.
I can't even afford fries, and I'm not going without you.
Please! I want to see the world!
Okay. I'll let Mom know.
I hate this place.
Marta Ostrowicz.
I'm Franek.
-Hi. You're also from-- -The Music Race, right.
You're phenomenal.
I mean, your voice is. It's not like I'm...
-Where's your friend? -I don't know, I'm looking for her.
Damn.
You haven't seen me here.
-Franek. -Right. You did well, Franek.
-Franek. -Right. You did well, Franek. Have you seen that girl from Rozalin around?
-No, I'm sorry. -Are you sure?
-No, I'm sorry. -Are you sure? I'm sure.
Why did you run away?
Wow, what a view! Amazing!
All this is... amazing.
The way you sang... I really liked it.
I like everything you do and...
and... you.
Good night.
There she is!
-Welcome! -Bye!
The prettiest! Most talented!
-Way to go! -I'll be going.
Bye, Antek! Thanks a lot!
There!
I thought my heart would burst when they all got up,
and then I almost laughed, because he was so shocked!
and then I almost laughed, because he was so shocked! -His face was so... -What?
-His face was so... -What? Dumbstruck!
And when they all stood up,
I was so overwhelmed... I had a lump in my throat.
Girls, get in! Hurry!
Hi!
I need to go!
-How's everything? -All right.
But listen, no one told the audience to stand up?
-No, they just really liked it! -No!
-You're going to win that show! -You're going back there?
No... come on. Why would I?
You're the best, you could win. Your singing is divine.
You said yourself: they loved it. What's not to like there?
Him. Acting like he didn't know Mom. He doesn't exist to me.
He got wasted every day for over a decade.
His brain is like brushwood by now.
-Mom! -Grandma!
Maybe he really didn't recognize you.
You went about it all wrong.
Guys need it laid out simple. I see it like this: you two go there--
Guys need it laid out simple. I see it like this: you two go there-- -Grandma... -You don't have to sing.
-Grandma... -You don't have to sing.
But give him one last chance.
You need to talk. Alone.
And you're wearing this.
Twentieth floor.
Goodbye.
Olo? Can you sign this?
Can I have an autograph? Please!
-He recognized you. -I'm sure he did.
Because he was looking.
-At the dress. -And you.
At you.
-I brought an extra set. -Thank you.
Yes?
I checked your room number.
Uh-huh?
Hi.
-Hi. -May I?
Sure.
How could I not recognize you?
I'm sorry.
I've changed.
Your eyes are the same.
-But the rest is different. -No...
it's about how I remember it.
You know how I've been. And you?
-You want a summary of the last 18 years? -If you don't mind.≈
Itemize them, I don't know.
When you disappeared...
I had Marta.
-Olo... -Okay, I know.
How much?
-Excuse me? -I'll pay, but I want her gone from the show. You too.
but I want her gone from the show. You too.
Get out.
Relax, there's nothing to be ashamed of.
-Just say the number, no problem. -I said get out!
What an asshole.
A jerk, a pig and a moron!
I'm sorry.
We won't be bothered by him.
All right.
Let's go home.
-Why not? -That's what he wants.
-I'll stay and win, to spite him! -But--
-I'll stay and win, to spite him! -But-- I left my phone downstairs.
Crying?
You ought to be happy.
You're nailing it!
People went nuts after your performance.
Hey.
Hey.
Losing the finals to you would be an honor.
I'll tell you what I think
Straight to your face
When I see you I feel ashamed
That you still walk this earth
So be aware that now I know
I know every answer Say something
Say something I've got a razor-sharp answer
You won't get away this time
You're holding up your guard
Making a million stupid faces
Wait, just you wait
I'm going to get you You keep repeating this
It's everything I do I'm sick of you
Those empty eyes I'm going to smash this mirror
That's right The face in the mirror is mine That's right, it's mine!
That's right, it's mine!
That's right The face in the mirror is mine
That's right, it's mine
-Great! -The face in the mirror is mine
That's right, it's mine
That's right The face in the mirror is mine That's right, it's mine
That's right, it's mine
That's right
That's right
That's right
That's right That's right
That's right
OSTRA WE LOVE YOU
Ostra, we love you!
Loving Ostra is not unique. Judging by posts on social media,
Loving Ostra is not unique. Judging by posts on social media, everyone loves Ostra!
Everyone! That's right!
I wonder
if our judges love her as well. Ewa?
If I'm to be frank...
It's pointless. Washout.
What? What?
Olo?
Olo, she's staying, get it?
Olo! She's staying!
First I'd like to thank the costume department. Great look.
Congrats, really.
What's this crap?
Ewa, what do you think?
No, I didn't like the performance or the look.
She stole your jacket. You'd look okay in it, but her?
-It's beautiful! -She looks great.
Let's get back to the song. You can sing, we can hear that. You've got the looks.
You can sing, we can hear that. You've got the looks.
But it's all so... pushy.
You're imposing yourself.
Is he nuts?
Maybe people buy it, but I don't.
-I don't agree! -This is not charisma.
-You're fired! -Fire him!
-Urszula. -This is baloney!
I can't believe my ears! You have know nothing about good vocals! How could you?
You have know nothing about good vocals! How could you?
I'm going to take those buttons from you!
Go on!
You, talking about charisma? You'd have to have it to talk about it.
She has it! She does!
And they say you can sing.
-Not that song. -Just that one?
You are spectacular! You are staying!
Lifeline!
Good job!
Ostra is staying on the show!
Ostra's great performance is behind us.
We'll find out what's next after a break.
YOU WERE GREAT! REALLY?
CHECK IT OUT!
Ostra!
Relaxed after the show?
-Even more so. -You have to be at your best.
And why is that?
You've got competition on the show.
-She is so insolent. -You like her.
-She is so insolent. -You like her. No!
Okay, what's this about?
You.
She's got the best voice this season, we both know it.
She's great, charismatic, brave. People will love her,
they'll call her a revelation, new star... You know how it goes.
I'm sorry for telling you this, but... I care about you.
We need to get rid of her.
The sooner the better.
Marta!
Marta, wait!
-Congrats, you were great! -You're really hot.
-Why is Olo harassing you like that? -Is Dykta really so awesome?
-Dykty! -Dykty.
-You're a great singer, we didn't know-- -You're so talented.
-Hi. -My family will vote for you. Everyone.
-Marta! -And me.
Here.
Hi.
I wanted to...
apologize.
Ostra, wait.
SHOCK AND AWE
MY APOLOGIES
OLO CAN WASH YOUR FEET FANTASTIC YOU'RE DIVINE
Go on, tell me.
It was... weird.
It was... weird. -Weird? -The faculty lost their minds.
-Weird? -The faculty lost their minds.
All they talk about is you. And your conduct grade is back to normal.
All they talk about is you. And your conduct grade is back to normal. They all wanted a pic with her.
Because they all suddenly like me.
Because you're great!
They were blind to it before.
Now you showed them you've got talent and you're the best.
-No! -What is it?
Pour me some Chablis.
-At 10:00 a.m.? -Come on!
"Asked why she refuses interviews by pop magazines, Ostra replied...
she didn't want to end up like Olo."
She spoke just one sentence!
She is the talk of the town! And only getting good press!
She hasn't even come up with one hashtag.
Hashtag motherfucker.
WHY IS OLO BENT ON DESTROYING OSTRA?
There will be no more lifelines!
Let's hear from the head of the jury.
Come on...
I don't know what to do with you.
-You've got a problem with me, huh? -I have...
a feeling you're not making progress.
The young grandpa said.
Olo...
And what would you know about progress? You've done nothing but regress.
Cheeky.
I think it's evaluation time.
Let's start with the queen of likes. Yes or no?
Listen...
you're so focused on notes...
-Hate's coming. -She's mincing her words,
-Hate's coming. -She's mincing her words, it's going to get ugly.
No emotions, whatsoever.
Hashtag not this time.
What about the empress of jazz?
Our granny.
Again? Are you brain-dead? She's great!
Yes, yes, yes!
You know the rules, Olo.
Ostra's fate is in your hands.
-Olo, seriously... -Seriously...
Ostra! Ostra! Ostra!
Now what?
Stay on him.
I don't like your cockiness.
And I don't like your last song.
"Dark Night"? Really?
"Dark Night"? Really? What's next? "Bright Day"?
Good one. Olo, she stays.
I used to be like that.
And I wasn't ready for fame.
Or any of this.
Press the fucking button!
And you're not either.
But maybe you need to see for yourself.
Hashtag Ostra stays on the show!
Got a light?
It's a no smoking zone.
Sorry.
Fucking asshole. You smoke?
Treacherous pig!
One boo in the audience and you screw our deal?
She was supposed to be out!
You're pathetic!
Małgosia! Wait!
Wait.
-You're... -A dick? Feel free.
I had 18 years to accept the fact you cut me out.
That you left me pregnant.
You never showed up or anything, ever.
But I won't let you hurt my child. She deserves a better father.
-Wait. -Let me go.
What are you doing? It's showtime. Now.
Everyone's waiting for you, you're sitting next to Olo.
Finally, we're all here, so we can move on to the press conference.
Thanks. Any questions?
Not everyone at once. The gentleman in the green jacket.
Olo, Ostra, everyone is electrified by your relationship.
Is there a chance for a glimmer of sunshine between you two?
-You know-- -It's--
It's like in Olo's song:
"It's dark now, so who cares?"
-We'll see what tomorrow brings. -Thank you.
-We'll see what tomorrow brings. -Thank you. -Authorization? -With my manager.
-Authorization? -With my manager.
Come pose for pics.
-You're not talking to me. -It doesn't show in a pic.
Ewa!
Coming or not?
In a moment everyone will forget about us.
Good. I'll have some peace.
Excuse me.
They took, like, three pictures of me. And, like, 300 of them!
You're fucking annoying!
-Could I get an interview? -Not now.
Mom, what are you doing here?
What's going on?
I screwed up.
Please, who hasn't?
-I also went through a crisis. -Yeah?
Sure.
Though it's hard to believe.
No one wanted to buy this idea and I had to...
sacrifice a lot to get the Race on air, to get people on board.
Then I meet you, the old-timer,
Ewa the fame whore, and Papaya...
and suddenly my life makes sense.
Yours will make sense too.
You just need to find... you know.
How old are you?
Forty.
-A kid. -What?
You have to have a baby.
A child would become more important for you, like Race was to me.
A child would become more important for you, like Race was to me. It'll be... an imperfect, somewhat naughty kid,
It'll be... an imperfect, somewhat naughty kid, but you'll love it all your life.
but you'll love it all your life.
-Boss! -Yeah?
A phone call! Urgent!
You don't need to yell!
That was Franek on Music Race!
-Thank you! -Franek.
And now, a song the younger audience probably doesn't know,
so we were surprised that a young girl
put up a real fight to sing it!
-Good luck. -Ostra!
Hello!
The negotiations went on for a week,
but I convinced them, because it's my birthday today!
I'll sing a song which is as old as I am.
It's 18.
That's right, Olo, it's your song!
With a special dedication to you!
You're a moron Making that dumb face
Getting nothing Non-operating brain
Burned out by coke You're a moron
Making that dumb face Getting nothing
Unable to love, unable to love
Unable to love, unable to love
Unable to love, unable to love
Unable to love
And he's got a broomstick up his ass.
Moments fly You're just getting by
You don't realize It's vegging, not a life
Constantly on pills Moments fly
You're just getting by You don't realize
Unable to love, unable to love
Unable to love, unable to love
Unable to love, unable to love
Unable to love
Thank you!
Ostra! Ostra!
Ostra! Ostra! Ostra!
Your parents won't be happy you chose such intense lyrics.
My mom is proud of me.
And my father is estranged, so I couldn't care less.
-I'm sure he regrets it now. -I doubt it.
Let's not forget it's Ostra's birthday!
Happy birthday to you
One more time Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you!
Nice, but it's time for the verdict, hopefully also nice for Ostra.
It hurt.
Good.
I'm still mad, that's right.
But... I kind of get you, you know? That's who you are, right?
A sucker for the audience. Okay.
And don't worry about the brat.
She's just a brat.
You ought to be sorry for her.
Having a dick for a father, no wonder she grew up to be so cocky.
Hey... I forgive you.
If you had voted the brat out first...
and it was my turn...
and they were booing...
then I'd also...
Yep.
Hashtag sincerity.
Hashtag we're alike.
Could you move?
Thank you.
The usual.
Congrats on the performance.
That was... intense.
And good.
Listen...
You need to know that...
I'd like to tell you-- Could you stop looking at the phone when I'm talking to you?
Could you stop looking at the phone when I'm talking to you?
Do you know what's on it?
30,000 followers, each one more important than you.
Wonderful. You think it's so important?
-You're drinking? -You're not my father!
Ready to go? What's up, Olo.
-We're not staying at the party? -No, I've got a surprise. Come on.
-We're not staying at the party? -No, I've got a surprise. Come on. Bye!
What is this?
I rented it. It's a special occasion.
-You think she'll come? -Sure.
-But it's-- -She'll come. She will.
Get the champagne!
Surprise!
Do I know you?
So... we drank a toast to Mommy...
now a toast to Daddy!
Wait...
What are you doing here?
Surprise.
I didn't know.
It's cool. I get it.
-You've got... a different life now. -What do you want?
Nothing now.
Great. Firm. Good.
Great legs. Over here, at me.
Firm expression. Sideways.
-I don't know... -It's our 15 minutes of fame.
A firm pose, great.
Firm legs. Grab her harder. Very good.
No smiles. Thar's right, great.
Ostra, face up. More intensity.
Great pose. New card.
-What would you compare your love to? -Excuse me?
-What would you compare your love to? -We are one.
They are one.
What is this shit?
Golden shit!
Couples are a commodity. We're going to do the same,
or else they'll dethrone us!
Check the number of their followers!
Motherfucker!
They are one...
I'll answer it!
-Who was it? -No one.
-Hi, Olek. -Hello.
-Hi, Olek. -Hello. You look old.
-A drink? -What do you want?
I'll see if I've got ice.
-I'd like to warn you-- -Apologize?
Warn me?
Against what?
Have you seen this?
This shoot, this interview-- it's too early. Too soon.
-Even if it's too early, it's too late... -It can be undone.
-Even if it's too early, it's too late... -It can be undone. ...for your parenting advice. That can't be undone.
...for your parenting advice. That can't be undone.
-This jerk is using her! -Now you're her father?
We don't want anything from you.
Least of all, your advice.
In case you decide I was right.
I'm sorry.
For everything.
Marta!
Ostra!
It went to her head.
I think Pati's going out with Antek now.
-I don't care. -Good.
The next episode's in a week. Meanwhile, you'll be catching up on schoolwork.
-I've got no time! -That's a good one!
Marta. Marta!
-This is a bit too much. -I've got to seize this opportunity!
Hey! Hey!
Marta!
What is this?
I came to catch a breath, and all I get is Antek, Pati... What do I care?
I've got a different life, I won't stay in this dump!
-What about school? -Write me a slip!
That was the semi-finals song by Ostra and Franek!
You two are great!
You've got voice, you've got charisma,
you've got sex appeal.
You give me chills when I listen to you.
Ewa, do you agree?
I do, finally we're on the same page...
about Franek.
Marta, I think... and I think you feel it too...
that it was a bit forced.
You're not Beyoncé.
-She's not. -So what?
Nothing!
It's great you're not pretending to be someone else.
You're yourself! You're Marta Ostrowicz!
Keep it like that!
Olo, your turn.
You want my honest opinion?
As always.
That was cheap.
Like that look which doesn't suit you.
You're pandering to primitive tastes. And do you know why they liked it?
-Because we're on TV. -We are.
Where it pays to be cheap. And to pretend to be someone else.
But you don't need that.
Trust me, I know.
I'm telling you this, because...
I wish you well. Because you're talented.
-My, my... -What's going on here?
Thanks for your opinions, judges.
The decision as to who will make it to the finals is up to you,
our viewers. We'll learn your verdict after a short break.
We'll take ten!
What was that senile speech supposed to mean?
How could you do this to me? You've sent us into media oblivion!
Do I look like a retiree?
Because that's how you've made me feel! Like a stupid old hag, who just doesn't get it!
-Or maybe you're hot for that brat? -Chill.
-Or maybe you're hot for that brat? -Chill. That's how you act! Admit it!
That's how you act! Admit it! You're hot for her! You could be her father!
You're hot for her! You could be her father!
I am her father.
-Did you cast Hot and Singing already? -No.
-Did you cast Hot and Singing already? -No. -You'll cast me. -Well...
-You'll cast me. -Well...
I'll give you something that will make you very happy.
Honey... a few years ago I might have been tempted, but now...
Information!
-And what will be in it for me? -You'll double your ratings.
Hashtag it's fishing time.
Once again, a round of applause for the first finalist, Mr. Władek!
-Bravo! -Success.
Do the viewers want to see Franek in the grand finale?
Do the viewers want to see Franek in the grand finale? Yes!
The shorter Freddie Mercury.
Here's the viewers' verdict.
Yes!
Congratulations! Ladies and gentlemen,
Congratulations! Ladies and gentlemen, we have only one spot left in the finals,
we have only one spot left in the finals,
and two semi-finalists:
-Marta and Amelia. -Marta.
Marta, come over.
Ostra! Ostra! Ostra!
-Will we see Marta in the grand finale? -Audience.
Watch it. Change of script.
-You'll get an envelope, read the note! -Three, be alert.
Read it.
Excuse me for a moment.
I've just received news that this envelope
I've just received news that this envelope doesn't contain a verdict.
This envelope contains shocking information
I must verify right now.
According to this... one of the semi-finalists
one of the semi-finalists
is closely related...
with our judge.
-Show the judges. -Shock!
Olo...
is this true?
If Olo confirms this,
someone will have to leave the show this minute.
Those are the rules.
Olo, we're waiting.
All right, I'll just ask you.
Are you...
the father of...
Marta Ostrowicz?
Two, close-up on Marta.
Olo?
Olo, we're waiting.
No one should have a father like me.
But are you her father or not?
-Olo, you have to tell the truth. -Olo?
Her lousy father?
I am.
Finally.
How moving!
I'm very proud of Marta.
According to the rules
no participant can be related to people working on the show.
And so, the finalists are...
Amelia...
-Franek... -Marta!
Marta!
-I'm sorry. -For what?
For fucking up my life for the second time?
-I had no idea they'd use it. -Marta!
Honey... don't worry. This place is not for us.
Honey... don't worry. This place is not for us. -We're going home. -I'm not going back to that shithole!
-We're going home. -I'm not going back to that shithole!
-We're going home. -I'm not going back to that shithole! -Marta! -What?
-Marta! -What?
I'm not going to live like you. A sad, lonely teacher in Rozalin!
-Leave me alone, all of you! -Marta!
-Awesome, dears, we're wrapping it up. -We've got it.
Fuck you.
Man, you can have 50 daughters all over the country, it's a gold mine.
Screw you... and your show.
You'll quit and pay a mil in fines? I doubt it.
You'll quit and pay a mil in fines? I doubt it. You shouldn't have signed the contract.
It's Marta. I guess I'm busy, catch me later.
GO BACK TO YOUR DUMP! IMPOSTOR DUMB CHICK!
THOUGHT NO ONE WOULD KNOW? YOU FAILED ME
NEPOTISM! LIAR HA HA HA
LITTLE LIAR ROZALIN'S HOTTEST
DADDY PAID
-Now what? -You dropped out.
And... the album?
-You said I was in your agency. -Maybe next year.
You need a rebranding. Because you've made a mess.
Yes! You had your father on the jury. People are calling you an impostor.
"Daddy got her on the show." That's what they're saying.
That's why, for now, I see no place for you in show business.
Believe me.
SHE'S DISGUSTING I ALWAYS SAID SHE WAS A DOG
I ALWAYS SAID SHE WAS A DOG SCREWED HER WAY UP FUCK ME, SO PATHETIC!
Finally!
Do you know what that asshole told me?
That I'm an impostor?
-Let's leave this place, please-- -Ostra!
It's over for you, but I have a shot at winning. You had your shot.
I tried to help you. Now you help me.
Go back to Rozalin, lay low and... don't call me.
You're toxic.
Hello?
Hi, how have you been?
Hi.
What is it? I'm busy.
Oh... it's nothing, bye.
Welcome to the grand finale of a one-of-a-kind show. There will be no mercy.
of a one-of-a-kind show. There will be no mercy.
We'll see which finalist will be showered with compliments,
We'll see which finalist will be showered with compliments, and which one with actual cold water.
and which one with actual cold water.
We'll see who'll prove to be waterproof and win the finale of the Music Race.
And then to which camera?
Let's check it.
Here? One to the right?
I'm fixing this spot.
Olo...
If we're all set, then ask the rest of the audience in and let's begin.
Okay? I'll be waiting in my dressing room. Thank you.
She's texting how she's all alone, suffering, deserted.
-Fuck! -She's your girl.
Ostra is not my girl! Screw her!
No, no... she won't drag me down.
She doesn't know her away around this world.
She's too lame for that.
Provincial cunt.
Olo...
-What's going on? -He bloke my tooth!
-He broke my tooth! -Let me see. Show me your face.
Are you crazy? Fuck! Where will I get him a tooth now?
-Hold it! -I've got more important things.
What's more important than the finals?
My daughter.
Get up.
Olo!
-Looking for Marta? -She won't take my calls.
She's not at the hotel, I don't know where to look.
I've got an idea. Come on.
Fuck!
Come.
You're kidding.
Get in. Come on.
Okay?
-Hold this. -What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Take it, before I change my mind.
This wasn't the best idea.
Best one I ever had.
I'll check the toilets.
Let's go!
What's he doing here?
-We were worried about you. -You're on his side now?
-Wait! Let's talk! -We've got nothing to talk about!
-Marta, wait. I'm sorry. -Sorry?
-You expect I'll forgive you now? -Don't forgive me.
But listen to me.
-Wait... -Leave me alone!
Please, let me say something.
I made a mistake back then.
But I couldn't miss my chance.
The thought of staying in Rozalin, having a family, nice and cozy...
I regret it.
I regret I didn't try to work it out with your mom somehow.
Now I know what I want.
To have a daughter. One like you.
I don't believe you!
Marta!
Marta!
Dad...
I finally passed math.
By some miracle, because that witch hates me.
Likewise.
Now it's just chemistry...
Easy-peasy.
Back then, outside the club...
I lied saying I didn't believe you.
Don't screw this up, Dad.
Oh, and I've got a surprise for you.
I wrote it for you a long time ago.
I wrote it for you a long time ago. So don't laugh.
You're not there
No, you're not there
When I'm screaming
You're not there
No, you're not there
When I'm whispering
I need your advice
I need to hear your voice
I need to ask you something
And like God, you are not answering
I need your advice
I need to hear your voice
I need to ask you something
And like God, you are not answering
Marta, wait!
I'm sorry about your father.
I know. Thanks.
Will we talk again?
Sure.
When all of this is over.
That was something, dear Olo.
Pity you've missed it. I must've watched it three times by now.
Maybe you'll see it someday.
Doctor. Doctor! Doctor!
I made up with Antek.
I think we'll be together.
True, he went out with Pati...
but I went out with Franek. and you had Ewa, and Mom has forgiven you. We need to forgive.
and Mom has forgiven you. We need to forgive.
Although Pati is worse than Ewa. A total bimbo.
And Antek... he's so honest and real.
I think I love him.
Lie down, please. Easy...
Lie down, please. Easy... Olo dear, easy...
Lie down, please.
What's your name?
Welcome to the next episode of Ewa: Hot and Singing.
This was supposed to be pink!
Nothing is ready, the check didn't come...
Ewa, not now, please.
Payday will come, now we need to get this on tape, so please, focus.
Now, when I want my teeth nicely exposed,
I use American Dream toothpaste.
Which also gets rid of bad breath.
-Good morning, ma'am! -Morning!
-Good morning! -I already said "good morning."
-You run too? -You asked me that yesterday.
Did I? And what did you answer?
That you asked the day before.
Welcome to the next episode of Ewa: Hot and Singing.
Today it's Bavarian cheese and dumplings... Mrs. Dykta, a half step lower.
Dykty!
The name's Dykty, how many times do I need to tell you, idiot?
The name's Dykty, how many times do I need to tell you, idiot? I'm not a Dictaphone!
Make me some lemon balm tea.
Are you kidding? You make me some.
Thanks.
And this is my prison.
There are only sheltered girls of means, their handmaids, and teachers here,
a girls' school separated from the world by high walls.
All its students are
from respectable families or will be marrying into one.
I am, no doubt, the latter.
She is free to go anywhere.
But not me.
May I introduce myself?
I'm pleased to be at your service.
I am the Auto Memory Doll,
Violet Evergarden.
What's a Doll doing here?
Your family instructed me to help you achieve success as a debutante.
Debutante?
In three months?
Yes.
I'm to be your tutor in culture, conversation, etiquette, and dance,
all that is befitting of a lady.
I will serve in that capacity until your debut.
Dolls do that kind of work too?
No, we usually just write letters for our clients.
If not for the Drossel royal family's introduction,
I would have declined.
You sound like a snob.
I really hate people like that.
I heard you're prone to coughing fits.
Don't touch me!
Your hand...
It's a prosthetic.
I lost it in the war.
A Doll who serves the royal family?
No, I'm a civilian doll. Our company is in Leidenschaftlich.
Leiden...?
It's the southernmost nation.
It's four days from here if you only use local trains
on the transcontinental railroad.
You can go anywhere you want.
For a job, yes.
If you say so.
I will remain with you until I complete my job.
I don't want to be friends.
So keep quiet unless it's absolutely necessary for my education.
You've got that grumpy look again.  Is it really that difficult a matter?
Yes, it's a request for Violet.
They want her to tutor an aristocrat's daughter.
A tutor?
And it's for three months.
Can't say no to the royal family.
But three whole months?
How about I go check on her every now and then?
It's a girls' boarding school. No men allowed.
A girls' boarding school...
These public love letters are so dreamy.
I made this the other day.
It's lovely.
You can have if you'd like.
Hey, look at this.
Who's she?
Never seen her before.
Do you know her?
No, I've never seen her either.
Good day, Miss York.
Who do we have here?
-She's-- -I'm serving as Miss Isabella's handmaid.
My name is Violet.
-Well, I'm-- -Miss Lancaster, I presume?
I've heard your name.
She's so beautiful.
She looks more like a princess than a handmaid.
Please use the outermost knife.
Miss, you've stopped working.
You must continue your lesson.
This is mandatory curriculum.
I don't wanna--
Please say "want to" instead of "wanna."
Taylor.
Sis!
Taylor!
You mean the world to me, Taylor.
Miss York, which salon will you be entering?
Miss Lancaster's salon, of course, right?
The Lancasters, the prime minister's family,
and the Yorks, the titans of trade, both have ties to the Drossels.
I'm so very sorry.
Miss Isabella is frail and has spent much of her life alone.
She is now trying to acclimate to living with others.
Would you please allow her a little more time?
Yes, of course.
How dreamy. She's like a knight from a romance story.
Miss Isabella.
Forgive me for leaving your side.
Just seeing you
makes me miserable.
Taylor.
Good day, Miss York.
After this, we'll be holding a tea party back at the dormitory.
-If you would like-- -Leave me alone.
I'm sorry, what was that?
I'm so sorry.
My master has instructed me to limit
her interactions with others until she becomes a debutante.
A true princess knight.
Very well, let us forget this ever happened.
Good day.
They only see me for who my family is.
It's like I'm trapped.
I wonder.
You're no different.
This is simply a job I must do.
You really are perfect in every sense.
You could even pass as royalty.
I'm an orphan.
You're really gonna stay three months?
Well?
You told me to keep quiet unless it's absolutely necessary for your education.
Forget that right now.
Our company has other Dolls, so business will continue--
That's not what I meant.
There's no one you'll miss?
So there is.
There is someone, but...
we cannot see each other.
Is that so?
I hope Violet is doing all right.
Taylor.
No, it's me, Violet.
How are you feeling?
Were you up all night?
I've undergone endurance training,
so a little missed sleep is...
It is not an issue.
Listen...
I want to talk to girls my age, but I really don't know how.
Very well.
But please tell me what you wish to talk about.
For example...
What?
It's time to get ready.
You'll be late for school.
At this school,
it's customary to practice with students filling in as male dance partners.
Miss Isabella, let's have you take the woman's part.
And I shall be the man.
-How dreamy. -She's a princess knight.
-I am so jealous. -How lovely.
But I'm gonna step on your feet.
Here is the secret.
Relax your body, and follow my lead.
Miss Isabella.
Hey, come on and join me.
No thank you.
Friends are supposed to bathe together.
Is that what they do?
Yes, exactly!
So, come on.
Get in.
This is actually the first time I've taken a bath with anyone.
Is that so?
Come here.
Is this also what friends do?
I don't know.
I slept like this with my little sister.
Did you?
Open wide, Taylor.
Is it good?
Sis!
Why--
You have the basic steps down nearly perfect.
Let's add some new steps today.
All ready.
Thanks.
-You always wear your hair the same. -Yes.
Miss Isabella?
Relax.
This will not do. You'll miss the morning lecture.
Don't worry.
I used to do my little sister's hair all the time.
Your hair is like velvet.
Bet it's worth a lot.
You'll sell it?
Of course, I won't.
And done.
You like it?
It might block my line of sight in an emergency.
Really? But it's so cute.
Okay then, how about this?
Ta-da! Just like cinnamon buns!
Miss Isabella, you seem to be having fun.
Was it so obvious?
Hey,
let's forget about school. Can't we go somewhere else?
Where?
Anywhere's fine.
Just the two of us.
We can't do that...
Miss Isabella.
Now, let's try that again.
Miss Isabella?
I can't do it.
I was never going to be a lady anyway.
-You've learned to dance and-- -I don't need your flattery!
I can't do everything good like you!
I'm not like you.
Not like me?
That's right. Totally different!
It's not fair.
You're so lucky, don't you think?
Sorry.
You're just a little tired.
What sorts of letters have you written?
I've written lots of letters.
Letters from kids to their parents and vice versa.
Letters from sisters to brothers. Even love letters.
Love letters? A straitlaced girl like you?
-Yes, they were well received. -Really?
Every one was filled with love.
Letters let you express
the things you normally can't say.
I was wondering.
I'm so mean,
but you're still so nice to me.
I'm nice?
Yes, you are.
I'm just...
doing what I've learned.
If you can't sleep, Miss Isabella, I could tell you about the constellations.
I learned about them when I worked at an observatory.
Very well, I'll tell you a story about the stars
that shine this time of year.
What's all this?
It's from you father.
You are to wear this when you become a debutante.
This is for you.
What's that?
"Having fun?"
What the heck?
It's a dress from my company.
And it was most likely delivered by one of my coworkers.
I bet it means he wants to see you as soon as possible.
You're leaving today, aren't you?
Yes, I'll be leaving tonight.
Then...
let's have lots of fun at the ball.
Will you escort me?
I'd be delighted.
They're all looking at you.
Is something wrong?
No, silly.
You're so beautiful.
Everyone is so dressed up.
But you're the most beautiful.
Don't leave my side, okay?
Okay, I promise.
Miss Isabella.
Violet...
thank you.
You're welcome.
Are you tired?
I am, but...
that was fun.
I didn't even step on your feet.
You didn't.
What will you do now?
I'll start writing letters again.
I...
want you to write a letter for me.
To whom?
My little sister.
I wasn't born into the York family.
Amy.
See that you do better next time.
It's tough out there what with the war.
Where's your mom?
Another abandoned child.
Even if we could sell her, she's probably not worth much.
-I've made up my mind. -What?
She'll be my little sister.
Don't be stupid. How could you possibly support her?
I mean, you're still a kid yourself.
It's about revenge.
I was forced to live like this.
This child was to suffer the same fate.
But I'll make sure she has a happy life.
I may have nothing, but I'll give her a fighting chance.
You call that revenge?
It's not my fault if you two die.
You're my little sister now.
I'm Amy.
I'll be you're sister.
Si...
Sis!
I'm home.
Sis!
Open wide, Taylor.
Is it good?
Sis!
Our room was filthy.
And we had next to nothing.
But back then,
there was nothing more I could do.
Amy Bartlett, I presume?
How dare you barge in here!
So, this is that woman's child.
The blood of the York family flows in her veins.
She is my daughter.
Leave your name and your past behind, and come with me.
Do that, and I'll see that the child is cared for.
It's in her best interest.
Did you truly think you could keep living like this?
Sis?
I had nothing to offer.
No dreams, no hope.
If it would mean a better life for her...
Sis!
Sis!
Sis!
My desire to protect her, to save her...
It became my reason to live.
That was the day I sold my freedom to the man who said he was my father.
And so ended Amy the pauper.
I've been separated from Taylor ever since.
We're not allowed to meet.
In some ways...
I can relate.
I never knew my parents. I was found abandoned
and was raised as a human weapon.
But then someone new entered my life.
He taught me to write.
And he raised me, always treating me kindly.
He even gave me purpose in life.
I never gave anyone anything.
That's not true, Miss Isabella.
You gave me my very first gift of friendship.
And...
you taught me that
holding hands can warm the heart.
And I believe you have given Taylor more than you'll ever know.
A letter would allow you to express your feelings.
Dear Taylor...
I'll pay you back someday.
I've nothing to give right now, but I will repay your kindness.
There's no need.
Why not? I want to.
I don't really know why, but...
I don't want you to.
Well...
will I ever see you again?
I don't know.
But remember, Miss Amy...
I'm an Auto Memory Doll.
I go wherever my customers desire.
So, the princess knight is gone.
Now we can finally talk.
Sure.
Your waltz at the debutante ball was lovely.
It was all thanks to Violet,
Miss Lancaster.
Please call me Ashley.
I wish to speak with you
without regard to house or standing.
Hey.
I have a couple of letters for you.
For Taylor?
That's right. Here.
Hey, you there. Can she read?
Nope.
Just my luck.
I'll read them to you.
Ready?
-Taylor! -Okay, here goes.
Big Brother.
I'm not your brother.
Whatever. Just listen.
The first letter is from my coworker, Violet Evergarden.
This gist is, come see me if you're ever in need or want a shoulder to lean on.
The next one doesn't have a return name or address.
Why's it so short?
"Here's a magic word that will protect you.
Just say, 'Amy'."
That's it.
Taylor,
I'm no longer known as Amy.
I abandoned my name because I love you.
But if you keep saying it like a magic word,
my hope that you'll have a better life
will never fade away.
Sis!
So, please, Taylor...
Amy.
"SAY MY NAME WHENEVER YOU'RE LONELY"
Postal service.
Postal service!
What's the matter?
Mr. Field isn't home again today.
That's strange. He's always making such a racket at night.
I could hold it for him.
No, it's collect on delivery. I'll come again this evening.
Hey! Hands off my bike!
Run! Stupid old bike!
Postal service.
Postal service?
Thank you.
Always happy to serve.
Where'd that postman go?
Postal service.
One moment please.
What on earth is that tall building over there?
I told you before, it's a radio tower!
What's a radio?
It's not going to give me headaches, is it?
It's nothing like that.
The war's been over four years now.
Lots of progress is being made.
Despite marked progress worldwide,
the work of a mail carrier hasn't changed.
It's the same thing every day.
What a boring job.
It's the same symbol.
Big Brother!
Big Brother!
Oh, my.
Are you lost?
Is that your little brother, Benedict?
Or maybe it's his love child.
Gimme break. She's just visiting.
I'm...
Taylor!
Taylor Bartlett!
What? You're a girl?
So you're Miss Taylor?
Yep!
You're Violet Evergarden?
She's delusional.
This is the letter you wrote three years ago.
It said to come see you if I'm ever in need.
That's why I'm here.
She's that kid?
Are you in trouble?
I've a favor to ask.
I...
want to work here!
Here?
"If you ever leave the orphanage
and find that you need help, please come find me.
Sincerely, Violet Evergarden."
I see.
Taylor, did you run away from your orphanage?
The letter is addressed to an orphanage in Drossel.
I can't imagine they'd let a girl your age wander around alone.
Is that true?
Yeah.
Besides, you need to be a bit older before you can work here.
No, please! I'm all out of money!
Nevertheless...
I've a favor to ask.
Violet?
She's the precious little sister
of a dear friend.
I want to know.
I want to know what "I love you" means.
Well, I suppose it will take some time to send her back.
It'll require some inquiries.
So then?
Sure, you can look after her till then.
Sound good?
Hooray!
You'll be helping the ghostwriters then.
No, I won't.
I wanna deliver mail!
Mail?
Deliver mail?
You don't want to help the ghostwriters?
I decided I wanted to be a mail carrier before I came here.
There's no way a little kid could do that sort of work!
Don't say that! Please, Big Brother!
-I'm not your brother! -Won't you do this for her?
Come on, you guys.
She's right. Benedict...
she came all the way here. Why not show her the ropes?
You heard the boss.
Listen up.
It may look easy, but delivering mail is really hard work.
Let's have you start with delivering this mail.
Where?
To the addresses on the envelopes.
Here, read that.
Let's see...
Two, one...
It says, "2125 Alexander Street, Mier District, Leiden."
-Don't tell me-- -Oh, yeah!
Mier District! I knew that!
Here?
Yeah.
Next address.
Hey, there's no mailboxes.
That means we go to each unit.
-The fourth floor? -Next.
That's it for today.
Let's head back.
Wow.
You deliver that much mail every day?
And you never even looked at a map!
That's amazing!
Any mailman worth his salt has his entire route memorized.
Big Brother.
No, wait.
Can I call you "Teacher"?
Are you kidding me? No way!
It lit up all by itself!
They're switching to electric lights all over the city.
Really?
Why'd you want to be mail carrier?
That's a silly question!
It's 'cause mail carriers deliver happiness!
I can sleep here?
Yes.
Where's your room?
The one across from the bottom of the stairs.
I have this whole room all to myself!
Teacher!
Teach me again tomorrow!
Here's the thing. You don't know how to read yet.
You didn't read a single address today.
You only read the numbers.
Yeah.
I can't read.
I have trouble learning the alphabet.
I always had the nuns read the letters I received.
"Here's a magic word that will protect you.
Just say, 'Amy'."
Sister...
read it again.
I didn't tell you everything.
Sorry.
Miss Taylor,
I'll teach you the alphabet.
Really?
Yes. We'll practice together tomorrow.
Practice?
Actually, I meant, study.
Study hard, and we'll make you into a fine young mail carrier.
Violet!
Yes, I'm Violet.
Do you think I'm a baby, 'cause I can't sleep by myself?
No.
It's looking outside?
Mine's a bear!
I used to sleep in the same bed with your sister.
Really? You slept together?
Yes.
Oh.
I wonder if I used to sleep with Sis too?
I wanna hear more about Sis.
Rise and shine, Miss Taylor.
Good morning.
They come undone with only two strands.
By braiding three strands, they'll stay in place.
Morning.
Good morning!
Good morning, you adorable little apprentice.
Mr. Roland, I thought you had retired.
I have so much time on my hands, I just can't help myself.
What about you, Violet?
I hear you'll be helping out with deliveries today.
"A" is for animals, "I" is for ice
"U" is for umbrella, But the weather's so nice
"E" is for ear--
Violet?
Luculia.
It's been ages!
Wait, why are you dressed like that?
We're delivering mail!
Delivering mail? With this little girl?
She's an apprentice, and I'm helping her learn.
You're helping her learn?
Where are you headed?
Newtown.
That's right over the bridge.
Luculia!
All right, see you later, Violet.
I'm Taylor!
Good luck with your job, Taylor.
Who was that?
She's also a Doll.
And that man?
I don't know.
I've never seen him before.
-This is Newtown? -Yes.
Try reading the address.
Okay... Le-i-den... shi...
-What's this say? -Retorika District.
Re-to-ri-ka Dis-trict. 812.
I can read!
Here it is!
Miss Taylor.
This way.
What's this?
They call it an elevator.
It's a new device being introduced at Newtown's latest apartment buildings.
How's it work?
I'm guessing we use this.
It didn't work.
It's moving!
That was our floor!
I'll bring it back down.
We made it!
The stairs would have been faster.
Hello there.
Oh, my.
Postal service!
Why, thank you.
It's from my mother.
Marty!
There's a gift from your grandma!
Really?
What is it?
Slow down!
It's candy!
Hooray!
Did it really look like I wanted some that bad?
It did.
Really? Luculia is in Leiden now?
Yes. She was there with a gentleman.
I wonder whether it was the man she's to marry.
I guess marriage means her Doll days are over.
No, she said she wouldn't quit.
She'll keep working even after she's married.
Really?
Times have changed.
They've changed?
There's more to a Doll's life than finding the man of your dreams and retiring.
That is the ideal life for a Doll?
Yeah, until now at least.
Do you two share that ideal?
Huh?
I wouldn't call it an ideal exactly.
But I want to become the top Doll in the world.
I want to write novels. That's my dream.
-Novels? -Really?
Actually, I already wrote and submitted a short story.
So many dreams and ideals.
Well, how about you?
My ideal?
Teacher!
I'm not your teacher.
Time for afternoon deliveries.
Miss Taylor!
You sure it's okay?
Yes.
No one's ever bought me clothes!
Is that so?
At the orphanage, it's all hand-me-downs!
I love having something all my own! I'm gonna treasure it.
Same with this!
I'm gonna treasure my teddy bear.
Having something to treasure.
It's...
a wonderful feeling, isn't it?
I wonder if Sis used to do this for me.
I forgot almost everything.
"Here's a magic word that will protect you.
Just say, 'Amy'."
Miss Taylor, why do you want to be a mail carrier?
I wanna be like Teacher 'cause he delivered Sis's letter.
I forgot what it was like when I lived with Sis,
but I still have this letter.
It reminds me about her and her love for me.
That's what Teacher delivered to me.
He delivered happiness.
Mail delivery is a truly marvelous career.
Amy...
I want to deliver happiness too.
Why don't you write a letter to your sister?
But I'm still learning to read.
Plus, I don't even know what I'd write.
Miss Taylor.
I'm a Doll.
Please,
let me help you.
You think Sis will like it?
Just tell her how you feel.
Dear Sis...
What?
Do you know how early it is?
Back to the orphanage?
No. We'd like you to deliver a letter.
You wrote this?
I learned to read and write.
You're sending it to Amy Bartlett?
Where's the address?
We don't have it.
Amy Bartlett...
is now Isabella York.
She attended a girls' school as heir to the York family,
but her current whereabouts are unknown.
Isn't she your friend?
We exchanged letters for a time.
However...
she stopped writing.
I imagine she was married off to an important aristocrat.
But we've no way of knowing who.
Are you asking me to track her down?
-But that's-- -Please.
Please!
Teacher.
I have to get that letter to Sis.
Every letter must be delivered.
But I have one condition.
I thought you might be here.
Hard work is all fine and dandy, but you also need your sleep.
Thanks.
That hits the spot.
I almost forgot. A letter arrived for you.
Found it.
This was his condition?
Yep. His old bike was on its last leg anyway.
Be careful out there, Taylor.
I will.
Let's go.
Okay.
Violet.
Yes?
Thank you...
Violet.
You're welcome.
Good luck, Miss Taylor.
May your love...
be delivered.
It seems the York family went to great lengths
to keep Isabella's true identity a secret.
But she's from one of the great houses with ties to the Drossel royal family.
So, there were only a few worthy suitors.
Now it's just a process of elimination.
She lives here?
This is Count Neville's manor.
The local villagers say they see the count often,
but they've never seen the lady of the manor.
However, merchants who visit here say
around this time,
they've caught a glimpse of her at the back of the mansion.
Excuse me.
I've a letter for you.
For me?
Yes, it's for Isabella--
Make that, Amy Bartlett.
Here.
Taylor...
Bartlett
I don't believe it.
Dear Sis...
The nuns told me what happened.
They said
you went off to somewhere far away for my sake.
But you still sent me a letter.
That's why...
I know that...
"I know that I'm Taylor Bartlett.
Amy Bartlett's...
little sister."
My...
little sister.
Good morning, Taylor.
Sis.
Violet helped her write it.
Oh, she did?
I'm so glad.
I'm so very glad.
Sis.
Like peas in a pod.
She can write now.
She was so little when last I saw her.
I'll write Taylor a letter.
And Violet too.
Will you deliver them?
Sure.
But someday, it just might be someone else.
Teacher, I saw you crying.
You were the one crying.
Yeah, but you were too.
Enough already.
So...
no second thoughts about not meeting her?
Nope.
Once I'm a real mail carrier,
then I'll come and deliver my letters myself!
Still haven't given up, huh?
-'Course, not! 'Cause mail carriers-- -We deliver...
happiness.
Right?
Amy
Taylor Bartlett was adopted by the Evergarden family.
And when she's old enough to work...
Wow!
...she'll become a mail carrier once again.
Postal service.
One moment please.
When will that big building be finished?
Someday.
All in good time.
Taylor!
as he approaches the penalty spot.
He's positioning the ball.
Everyone's looking at one another.
The stadium is silent.
Baggio makes a short run.
Off he goes.
Who is Roberto Baggio?
Well, I was born 17 years ago
in Caldogno, where I still live.
I started playing when I was two or three years old. NETFLIX PRESENTS
I'd carry the ball around the house.
And now I've been playing at Vicenza for five years.
People speak highly of you, you know?
Yes, I realize that.
Being 17, how does it feel?
Well, I'm happy. It's satisfying, but…
I have to prove myself on the pitch. Is Vicenza holding you back?
-No, it's fine. -When will you make the big jump?
That's for the club to decide.
Now we have to win the league. I hope it's the right year.
-Food's on the table. -Coming!
Hurry up, Eddy.
Nadia, come help Mom.
Coming.
Eddy, call Walter. He's always on the phone with his girlfriend.
Walter, dinner is ready.
Roby, is what the paper says true?
-Yes, but don't show them. -You have to tell them.
The water, get the water.
-Are we eating? -Of course, we're eating.
-Rice and peas. Did you wash your hands? -Yes.
You all are driving me mad.
No, that's bullshit.
You think I want to be here tonight?
Mom, say something.
Hey, what's all this noise?
Finally.
So?
Eddy, tell Dad about the History test.
I got a B.
Good job, little man.
Daddy, I went shopping with Mom, but they didn't have your cheese.
Daddy, I went shopping with Mom, but they didn't have your cheese. They had the wine.
I'm going out tonight.
And I talked to Sandro.
He said that for now they're not hiring, but maybe soon.
I signed with Fiorentina.
For 2 billion and 700 million lire.
Holy Virgin Mary.
Why didn't you tell us sooner, son?
I wanted Dad to be here too.
Are you getting this money?
Well, no. Vicenza is.
I'm getting a salary. And it's good too.
Great. So you can pay me back for the windows you broke in the shop.
He doesn't practice his free kicks in his room.
Maybe I can come back sometime and help you with the shop.
With what Fiorentina is paying you,
focus on earning that money.
Do you care at all that I'll play in Serie A?
-What should I tell you, that you're good? -For starters.
You're all the same to me.
You're not better than your brother,
who busts his ass at the factory.
And if you expect a compliment for everything you do,
you won't get very far.
You have to work hard and fly low.
What do you know about getting far?
I have eight kids. Eight.
How could I feed them?
I couldn't race as a cyclist and leave your mom alone.
So it's our fault you didn't become Eddy Merckx.
With all this talking, you're scaring the ducks.
See what happens when you fly low?
Go fetch!
Roby!
If you don't hurry, they'll start training without you.
Easy, you'll get hurt.
Will you come with me to Florence?
Yeah, right.
What about school?
There are schools there too.
They'll never let me go.
Then insist.
If you insist,
sooner or later…
My dad would have a stroke.
Let's just walk.
You give up too easy.
Watch.
-Let's go. -See, when you insist?
-Go. -You ready?
Yes.
MAY 5TH 1985 RIMINI-VICENZA
How does it feel to be the highest-paid 18-year-old?
Well, it's a big responsibility.
Since these are your last games in Serie C,
try not to rub it in against us.
Okay.
What did he want?
Who, Sacchi?
He's afraid I'll score.
Then do it.
Come on!
On the right!
The ball!
Anterior cruciate, capsule, meniscus and collateral.
We pierced the tibia head with the drill.
Then we cut the tendon, put it through the hole,
pulled it up, and secured it with 220 stitches.
Two hundred and twenty?
When can I play again?
When can I play again?
Focus only on healing.
I'll come back later to check on him.
Mom.
Yes, honey. I'm here.
If you love me, kill me.
What are you saying?
Don't even kid around like that.
Don't ever talk like that.
Baggio.
You made it.
Good morning.
Welcome.
-Morning. -Morning.
I'll take that.
Thank you for bringing him here.
Thank you for taking him like this.
Well, little by little, right?
-Roby, I'll wait for you inside. -Yes.
-Thanks again. Bye. -Goodbye.
In the 1970 World Cup, the final was Italy versus Brazil.
We lost 4-1.
I was there, devastated.
You came to me
and you said,
"I'll win the World Cup against Brazil for you, I promise."
Do you remember?
Unbelievable! The one time that we're in the final.
And you can't play well?
Brazil is the champion of the world.
I was three. How could I?
Listen.
This injury was the best thing for you.
You thought you made it, and you lost it all.
Nothing is owed to you in life. Nobody gives you anything for free.
Luckily, you found that out early on.
Lucky me.
We'll see.
Roby!
Listen, there's an issue with your paychecks.
Meaning?
Meaning that they haven't been cashed.
Did you get the checks?
I know.
I haven't played yet. I mean, you're paying me to do nothing.
Hey, you're not the first to get injured playing the game.
Come on, go cash those checks.
And cheer up a bit!
Come on now.
Need help?
Yes. Is there a new record by--
The Eagles? No, I'm sorry.
It's the third time you've asked me about the Eagles' record.
Also, The Eagles haven't made a record since '79.
Baggio, is everything okay?
How do you know my name?
You think I wouldn't recognize our most promising player?
Yeah, real promising.
What do you mean?
Everyone here says that you're…
-A phenom, I heard. -A phenom.
Maurizio.
Roby.
If it's okay, I'd like to give you something that did a lot of good for me.
Have you heard of Buddhism?
Why do you laugh?
Look, I reacted like you at first.
But then, starting the journey changed my life.
The Human Revolution.
I'll put my address on here too,
so if you want,
you can stop by my place sometime,
and we can practice a bit. What do you say?
Sure, maybe next time.
When The Eagles make a new record.
Thanks.
Thank you.
JANUARY 1ST 1988
-Yes? -Happy New Year, my love!
Hello?
What's going on?
I'm quitting.
I'm not doing well at all.
I'll come back to Caldogno.
Wait, I can't understand. Mom, will you turn it down, please?
They want to sell me to Pescara.
In Serie B.
Do you know what that means?
I'll just come back home, and we'll be together.
Are you there?
Listen, Roby.
You survived an injury that would've made anyone else--
Survived, Andreina?
-I played two games in two years. -And you scored against Maradona.
Everyone still remembers here in town.
And your dad told me you promised you'd win the World Cup.
Is that true?
I can't take it anymore.
Then insist.
Because if you insist, sooner or later…
You taught me that.
I insisted, and I finally convinced my dad.
I'll be there soon.
Really?
Yes.
Don't get yourself down. You only need…
to find the strength to go on, you know?
Happy New Year, my love.
Bye.
Baggio?
Come on, baby. Please, understand. He's a friend going through a crisis.
See the shape he's in?
Come on, please. Don't do this again. Don't be mad.
-Did I get you in trouble? -No, she'll get over it.
Come on, we'll do a quick half hour to get the hang of it.
-Seems a little short. -Short?
No? We could do an hour or two.
I have nothing to do all day.
Nothing to do all day? Then we'll stay here until the Epiphany.
-Who's that guy? -Daisaku Ikeda.
The sensei. My master.
-Do you also speak Japanese? -No, doesn't matter.
With time, you'll see
that enlightened minds can communicate in other ways.
Well, how does this thing work?
Okay, read this. It's ancient Chinese.
-Good. -Meaning?
It's the essential mystic law of life.
So if I say this phrase every day, then I'll feel better?
Well, it takes some commitment.
It's not "abracadabra."
You have to focus on your goals,
elevate your life condition, clean your karma.
Clean what?
-Your karma. -What's that?
It's the fruit of the actions that we all take.
Like a sort of rap sheet?
Yes. Not really, but I mean,
if you do right, your karma is clean. If you don't…
-It's dirty? -See?
Okay.
I think mine is pretty clean, I've never hurt anyone.
Well, except a few ducks while hunting.
There you go. Listen carefully. Pick that up.
Two on this side.
Like this.
Perfect, very good. Let's do it.
No, serious.
The important thing you have to understand
is that everything is up to you.
You're in control of your life.
You're the one who determines your existence.
You determine your own future.
So, first you focus on a precise goal.
You write it down, you visualize it.
And then you throw all your energy into it.
Because believe me,
if you don't work hard, things won't happen on their own.
-Thank you, Roberto. Bye. -Bye, thanks.
In the 1970 World Cup,
the final was Italy versus Brazil.
We lost 4-1.
You came to me
and you said,
"I'll win the World Cup against Brazil for you."
Do you remember?
I look better there than in real life.
-You're stupid. -You keep getting better.
-You're stupid. -You keep getting better. Why don't you do it for real?
Yeah, sure. Drawing is not a real job.
And kicking a ball around is?
That's different. You have talent.
God.
You only need a little confidence.
Actually, there is something that could help you.
Well, at least, it's been helping me.
I've been praying for two months.
What? You go to Mass?
I've become a Buddhist.
You're such an idiot.
I'm serious.
Really, Roby?
-Really? -Yeah, really.
I mean, you pray to Buddha?
Two hours a day.
One in the morning and one at night in front of the Gohonzon.
Two hours a day?
You're crazy.
Why?
Why?
You told me that I had to find the strength to go on.
I'm finding it.
Roby, listen, this is like a cult.
I mean, they'll take all your money.
You look at me and tell me.
Am I better or worse?
NATIONAL TEAM CALL-UP
Maybe I should've specified, "a feasible goal."
Why? This isn't?
Well…
You're going to Serie B now, you tell me.
I actually held back.
Why? What did you want to write?
Win the World Cup against Brazil.
Tomorrow morning, 6:30?
Yes, and thank you for coming.
Listen, what was your goal in life?
Maybe you wanted to be
a famous drummer.
Right. Keith Moon.
The Who's drummer.
And then what happened?
Nothing, why?
Well, it doesn't look like…
-Right? -Listen.
Keith Moon died at 32 of a drug overdose.
Who do you think is doing better, me or him?
It's not what the world gives you that makes you happy.
-I still want to win the World Cup. -Good.
You'll have to practice a lot, but…
Baggio, I was looking for you.
They're waiting for you in Pescara.
What do you mean? You still want to sell me?
The national team, Roby. Understand?
It's the call-up for the friendly against Norway
in Pescara on October 19th.
Get dressed. Domenica Sportiva is waiting for an interview.
-For me? -No, for me. Come on, let's go.
6 YEARS LATER
While all sporting events have halted for Christmas, the talk of the day is Roberto Baggio's personal success,
as he was just awarded by the magazine France Football
the 1993 Ballon d'Or,
an acknowledgment that goes to the best player of the year.
Good evening.
We're live from Giants Stadium in New Jersey, close to New York…
USA WORLD CUP 1994
…where Italy is about to start its adventure at USA '94.
In a few minutes, the Azzurri will be on the field
against Éire, the Republic of Ireland,
for their first game of the World Cup.
Let's go, I put the game on!
Come on, people!
Yes, I'm recording.
Italy!
No more cards, the game is about to start.
Put them away.
Italy called, yes!
ITALY - IRELAND 0-1
One touch.
I get the ball, I give the ball. One touch.
But no. We were stretched.
Instead of being here, here,
and here, what did we do?
We ended up being here.
We knew that Ireland was stronger physically, right?
How long did we study them for? Two whole months.
Two months.
And then, we let them…
We played their game instead of playing ours.
One touch.
Coach?
How can I dribble past a guy with one touch?
What are you saying, Roberto?
If every time I touch the ball I have to pass it,
I mean, how can I dribble?
Everyone in the video room.
Let's go over the game.
Except you.
Come here.
You know you're not playing in the qualifiers, right?
I'm playing out of position.
I feel excluded from the game like this.
And we lost against Ireland.
I know.
But,
you, Roberto, have to stay calm.
You have to trust me.
Because for us, you're like Maradona for Argentina.
You're crucial.
Would you ask Maradona to play one touch?
It'll take a show of strength from our national team
to forget the bitter stint against Ireland.
…short pass for Baresi,
who's able to play the ball.
Casiraghi, Roberto Baggio gets closer. He shoots!
Good effort.
On the far right.
The pass for Baresi, he…
Bjørnebye, Rushfeldt… We have to be careful!
Our defense was unprepared
and Pagliuca…
No!
-Was it a foul? -Yes, outside the box.
…the opposing player is sent off.
This is not good at all.
Pagliuca sent off…
He has to take a striker out.
-What happened? -Pagliuca got sent off.
No!
No way. He's taking Roby out?
-Why would he do that? -He took Roby out?
What do you mean, Baggio?
Baggio is saying, "Who, me?"
This guy is crazy.
He said he's crazy.
-What did he say? -That Sacchi is crazy.
That's not good. Not good.
Baggio's expression first, then Sacchi's.
He took out the Ballon d'Or winner. Bye!
…Marchegiani.
Did you want to talk to me, Coach? ITALY - NORWAY 1-0
Come here.
What was that you said when I pulled you out?
That I'm crazy?
On a worldwide broadcast?
You think you made me look like shit in front of a billion people?
I'll tell you a secret now.
You looked like shit.
You showed that you're an immature and arrogant player.
Coach, you told me that I was crucial.
You're all the same to me.
And if I'm down a man, I think of winning,
not about protecting someone's sensibility, got it?
But anyway, yes, I'm crazy.
Real crazy, though.
If you're not crazy, you won't even try to change football in Italy.
Now go.
Starting tomorrow, up at 5:00 a.m.
We need to work on movements without the ball
because we're not precise.
We're a mess!
The referee blows the whistle.
Final score is 1-1.
Useless game.
-Useless. -Now what?
-Useless. -What happens now?
The problem is the midfield pressing.
No, it's Sacchi, he doesn't let them play. ITALY-MEXICO 1-1
Everyone's an expert now?
Sacchi won everything, he knows what he's doing.
Sacchi.
He looks so sad, that boy.
He needs us.
He needs his family.
We have to go there.
If they go through, we'll go.
Right, Florindo?
Okay.
Gianni Agnelli, the owner of Juventus,
said that Baggio, against Mexico,
looked like a wet rabbit.
It's a tough blow for the image
of the most awaited player on this team and most coddled at Juventus.
-Look who's there. -Where were you? It's 1:00.
What a mess, we got lost.
We went around New Jersey three times.
I know it like home.
Your dad has us arguing here too.
My love.
Dad, I love you.
Honey, I love you too.
-Hi, love. -Hi.
How are you?
How am I?
Good now. I'm good now.
Where are the bags?
He has them.
They told us to put them in that cart.
Albertini!
Donadoni!
Pass the ball to Massaro!
What ball? There's no ball.
The Nigerians are faster, stronger.
We have to forget that we went through as third in the group.
Our World Cup starts now.
We're in the last 16 of the World Cup,
and we are Italy.
We're in round 16, an elimination round.
If you win, you go on. If you lose, you go home.
Italy has always played football as it did war.
We only shoot the moment the enemy makes a mistake.
Damn it, ref!
This would be a foul. It'd be a yellow card.
Is this the Italy that you want to be?
A country without any new ideas,
incapable of change?
We are ugly because we only think about ourselves.
Me, I'd rather see a team,
not 11 players.
Carlo?
Announce the starting 11.
Marchegiani.
Mussi.
Maldini, Costacurta, Benarrivo.
Donadoni, Berti…
Baggio… Roberto.
And Massaro.
The trajectory is high.
The ball, it's a goal.
No! What was that?
…a strange goal.
A mistake in the confusion…
I can't believe it. I'm going home. That's it.
…Yekini scores.
Let's see it again.
A few minutes left.
The atmosphere is discouraging.
Come on, Roberto.
Another initiative.
Here we go. The ball finds Baggio.
And it's a goal by Roberto Baggio in the 43rd minute of the second half.
Roberto Baggio ties up the match.
Yes!
Roberto Baggio.
It seemed over.
I'm telling you. He'll keep scoring.
A chip for Benarrivo!
He's down. Penalty!
Easy, easy.
It's a penalty, not a goal yet.
How much longer?
A moment of great excitement and trepidation.
Eleventh minute of the first overtime.
Roberto Baggio against Rufai.
ROUND 16 ITALY - NIGERIA 2-1
BAGGIO REUNITES ITALY
Long for Signori.
Signori finds Roberto Baggio.
Roberto Baggio shoots!
And scores! Roberto!
QUARTER FINALS ITALY-SPAIN 2-1
Coach!
BAGGIO TAKES ITALY TO THE SEMIFINAL AGAINST STOICHKOV'S BULGARIA
…gets in there. The ball's on his right foot!
He scores!
Costacurta!
Good job, Roby!
Straight. The ball is for Roberto.
He's in the box. Looking for an opening, but he doesn't get through.
Tsvetanov doesn't let him through.
SEMIFINAL ITALY - BULGARIA 2-1
Even if you kill me, I won't miss the final against Brazil.
It was hot in the stadium.
I noticed.
It was 104 degrees, 100 percent humidity.
Of course you guys get hurt.
Well, I made you a promise, right?
What?
When I was three.
The final against Brazil.
You promised you'd win.
You haven't won yet.
What are we doing?
Trying a couple of shots.
-Here? -Yes.
I want to test your leg.
Harder.
With all your strength!
Again.
-Again! -That's enough!
-No. -Do you want me to play the final?
I want to know if you're able to.
Maybe you'd prefer I get injured for good, so I won't play.
What?
If you win the Cup without me, the credit is yours,
but if I overshadow you,
it's not Sacchi's Italy anymore, it's Baggio's.
Let me get this straight, you think I want to injure you?
I've found someone more paranoid than me.
I'm going on the pitch. If I'm not well, you can swap me out.
Good evening.
The Italian national team beat Bulgaria…
Many TVs and giant screens all over Italy…
…in the streets and squares,
the wildest fans dive in the square's fountains,
and we're hearing the deafening sound of the cars honking all around us…
THE FINAL
You dream your whole life to play the final against Brazil.
Then, when it happens, the referee blows the final whistle,
and it feels like you haven't even played a minute.
Zero-zero, says the scoreboard.
But you don't remember anything,
But you don't remember anything, as if your brain didn't register any of it.
Overtime starts, and that goes in a flash too.
Time fell in a black hole.
Puhl blows the whistle.
The 15th title of World Champion will be awarded
for the first time ever by way of penalties.
After an instant, the penalties also fell in a black hole.
Time had been stripped away.
You can't tell where you are, what's happening.
And all that you know is written up there.
Dunga.
He scores.
Then, all of a sudden,
the black hole that swallowed time spits it back out.
What was fast becomes slow, almost still.
Suddenly, every second seems to last a lifetime.
And when time decides to go mad, present and past get confused.
Brazil takes the lead.
Roberto Baggio will take our last penalty kick.
We still have
a sliver of hope.
Gentlemen, this kick will decide the winner
of the 1994 World Championship.
Goal!
What a great penalty by Roberto Baggio!
And Italy is the World Champion!
His teammates surround him!
The entire stadium cheers and yells out his name, Roberto Baggio!
Roberto Baggio!
Goal!
6 YEARS LATER
What's wrong with it?
Nothing, it's just old.
It doesn't bear fruit. I may have to chop it down.
Are you a gardener now?
I'm unemployed.
I may have to be chopped down too.
Didn't the Japanese want you? How much did they offer?
Fourteen billion lire.
And that's not enough? What are you still doing here?
I'd rather stay here.
You're still thinking about the World Cup.
Don't you get that they don't want you here?
Not even at Vicenza.
I found out, you know.
Why are you always busting the coaches' balls?
Ask them.
I don't do anything wrong, I only ask to play.
No, I'm asking you.
You must share some of the blame, right?
I overshadow them, I don't know what else to say.
I don't complain. I train, I pray, that's it.
There, "I pray."
Maybe all this Buddhism wasn't good for you? -I'm asking. -You don't know what you're talking about.
-I'm asking. -You don't know what you're talking about.
Doing strange things makes you look like you're different.
That people don't trust you.
You only think of yourself, not the team.
There, you said it.
Still with this "Baggio is not a team player."
Come on, please.
It's bullshit that the coaches make up to get rid of me.
You always wanted to overshadow your brothers.
Me?
Maybe you always treated me worse than the others
instead of believing in me.
You're the one who has to believe in yourself.
And if you believed a little more, maybe you would've scored that penalty.
Silly me.
Thanks for the reminder, by the way.
Still the penalty?
How the fuck did I miss it?
I've never shot one high in my life. Never.
You know what I think?
That everyone loves you so much because you lost that final.
Because you showed that you're human, you make mistakes, and you hurt.
Like everybody else.
I'm going for a walk.
Go back to sleep, don't worry.
Vittorio, sorry if it's late.
Am I disturbing you?
What did you write down as your first goal?
I wrote many.
And Roby, what's important is the journey.
We discover the real goals along the way.
Why do you ask?
Because you're a friend first, then my manager.
Of course I'm your friend.
Otherwise I wouldn't drive 125 miles at 5:30 a.m. to come here.
I want to go to Japan.
You changed your mind?
You decided to accept the offer?
No.
Two years from now.
For the Japan and Korea World Cup.
With the national team.
I understand what you mean about the journey.
But I feel that I have to be there.
Wearing that jersey.
I'm here for you. That's why I came.
The problem is without a team, I won't be called to the national squad.
I'll find one. Shit, there must be someone who's still sane out there.
Like in the scene where Forrest Gump starts running
and people follow him,
here behind Roby Baggio, the entire town is running along with him.
Since he's back to training at home, this is an everyday recurrence.
A collective ritual, and a touching one.
The champ given back to his native town's embrace.
Gino?
Caldogno's kids…
-Ginetto? -What is it?
With all the crap players you bought,
why not Baggio? He doesn't have a team.
How long will it last?
Is Roberto Baggio's career really over?
Thanks for wanting to see me.
As you know, we've had some complicated situations
with a few coaches.
Everything that Roby stands for, his values,
all the love that people have always had for him,
well, for some people it's a problem. I know.
A lot of prima donnas among my colleagues.
I understand you.
You give your best if you're the center of the team.
In that situation, nobody's better.
Well…
I only need to feel the trust in me, like everyone else.
Here in Brescia, you'll have all the trust you need.
We don't need to win the league, just avoid relegation.
Do you want to save us?
Well, we'll try.
I know, for being a first draft, it's very detailed.
But it's important to protect not only the player, but also the man.
Keep in mind, President, that Roby…
Explain to me this Buddhist thing.
The image is important, he's an example…
Nothing, I'm Buddhist.
Your manager is Buddhist,
your wife also.
You're not going to convert me!
My wife was a lot more skeptical than you at first.
But you hunt.
And that's not very Buddhist.
No, I…
When I was a kid, I'd hunt just to spend time with my dad.
Why? Where was your dad?
He was always working.
And, you know, he had seven other kids.
Look,
I've seen a lot of players.
In the end, they're all the same.
They see their coach as a father.
That's why you always had problems.
You wanted all the love for yourself.
Of course, with seven brothers.
Well.
I'm not sure, really.
Don't worry, while I'm here, there's only one strategy.
Everyone passes you the ball, and you score.
Do you like that strategy?
What is it?
Nothing, it's just that we're happy.
About what?
That you play with us. We still can't believe it.
Come on, let's play then.
Let's go!
Maybe we'll even win, huh?
Roberto, make me happy.
CAPTAIN BAGGIO
BAGGIO IS THE CAPTAIN
BRESCIA IS REBORN
To Mazzone!
Once again, vindication for Roberto Baggio against one of his former teams.
BAGGIO'S MASTERPIECE
BAGGIO SAVES BRESCIA
With Baggio's arrival, the chase for the UEFA spots is on.
We've never seen Brescia playing so well.
Warm up, come on.
BAGGIO SCORES!
DIVINE HAT TRICK BRESCIA FINISHES IN EIGHT PLACE
Roby!
Brescia!
Coach!
JANUARY 2002
I've been watching you. You're in shape.
Almost the Baggio I used to train.
I'm well, Coach.
Also thanks to Mazzone.
You know what they say?
He's the poor man's Trapattoni.
No, Carlo would say that I'm the rich man's Mazzone.
It's true.
So, you want me to tell you that I'm taking you to the World Cup?
It's six months away, Roby. That's a long time.
I know. I realize that.
I only ask that you'll keep me in mind
when you'll make your choices.
Giovanni, you know this.
This is Roby's last chance.
If he keeps playing like this, I mean…
Very well, if you're fit, I'll take you.
I guarantee it.
This is the only thing I can tell you.
It's enough.
Brescia is still putting up a fight, looking for the tying goal.
Come, Mom.
Yes, I'll be right there. Don't move.
Don't move.
Giunti goes long.
He tries a nice through ball that sets up Tare.
Back pass for the arriving teammate…
-I told you not to move. -Mom?
Dad got hurt.
Hi.
Hi, Andreina.
How is he?
The surgeon says he wants to see him tomorrow morning.
No.
What, no?
He says that he doesn't want another surgery,
that he can't take it anymore.
What's this all about?
It's over. That's it.
Are you telling Master Ikeda?
What?
That you gave up on the World Cup in Japan, in his home.
Roby, this is your World Cup.
FIFA allowed 23 players. Shit, they did it for you.
I'm too old for another surgery.
Your face was in the mud when you hurt yourself, Roby.
This is the image the world saw.
Really, the entire world saw it.
Baggio crying with his face in the mud.
I don't know if you're okay with that, but I'm not.
So, now you get up,
you fight,
and even just for a minute, you play again.
This is the example.
This is the image to leave behind. Baggio, on the field, standing.
With your head held high.
The surgery lasted an hour and a half.
We reconstructed the cruciate ligament
and removed the meniscus.
How did it go?
Well. In six months, you can be back on the field.
I can do it in three.
What's he doing?
When your dad gets his mind on something,
he loses it.
Let's get him before he hurts himself again.
Roby, please.
Roby, come on.
-No, I can do it. -Really.
-I'm walking. -It's too soon. Come on.
I'll lean on you.
Vale! Come here, please. Mattia!
I'll give you three steps.
HEAL IN THREE MONTHS
HEAL MIRACULOUSLY
Leave it alone, poor thing. Come on.
"Where my capacities end, there begins my faith.
A strong faith sees the invisible,
believes the incredible, and receives the impossible."
Roberto, make me happy.
-No, Pep, we can't do this. -Yes.
There's only one captain.
Move it, I want to win this game!
Let's go, come on!
What are you doing out here?
And you?
Not watching.
I can't watch either.
If he gets hurt again…
He got in his mind that he wants to go to the World Cup.
He's more stubborn than an Alpine mule.
I think I know where he got it from.
If he loses again on penalties, he better not come back.
Don't kid around like that.
…the shot from Toni, the save.
Toni again for Baggio!
Baggio, he scores!
Roberto Baggio!
Goal!
Yes!
MAY 2002
It was all extraordinary.
First Pep gave you the captain's armband.
That's out of protocol, you can't do that.
Then, two goals in 20 minutes.
First one, bicycle kick. Top corner.
My goodness.
Second one, easy.
Mattia would've scored that one.
But it has to be said, that wasn't a rebound.
It was the ball declaring its love for the predestined.
Who is it?
Trapattoni.
Hello, Coach?
I'm well, thanks.
But you told me.
Got it.
Yes. Thanks.
Roby?
He was bullshitting me.
"If you're fit, I'll take you."
"If you're fit, I'll take you."
What the fuck more could I have done?
What more could I have done than this?
Nothing, that's it.
You did everything that was humanly possible and then some.
It took you 77 days to get back on the pitch.
He got it wrong. He didn't get that you're a symbol.
A symbol.
I can't believe it.
Fuck.
Should we hold a press conference, Roby?
What are you doing?
Roby?
Roby.
Roby, will you stop?
Roby.
You were right.
It's the journey.
The journey.
You're not even that pissed.
I'd lose my mind over something like this.
Anger doesn't accomplish anything.
Who said that? Buddha?
I'm sorry.
I promised you I'd win the World Cup.
You were three years old.
You were asleep.
You didn't even see Italy versus Brazil.
You mean, I never made you that promise?
No.
Are you kidding?
Why did you tell me that?
Because you had something I never had.
Talent.
I didn't stop cycling because of you guys.
Not at all.
I was mediocre, that's it.
But you had a gift.
Something that's one in a million.
But you didn't have a goal.
Something that would keep you going through tough times.
And I gave you a goal.
You're telling me
that scene that you told me,
on which I've based only my entire life,
you made it up.
I was afraid you didn't have the character.
You seemed fragile.
It seemed that you'd play well just to hear that you're good.
Look, if that was your only goal…
Come here, you're scaring the ducks.
In this moment, I feel a strong urge to shoot you.
Don't shoot too high this time too.
Fuck off.
This World Cup, after all….
You have something better. You know what?
That people love you.
I know I wasn't the father you wanted.
But I had to prepare you for life.
It's not easy for people like us who have nothing.
Yes, I understand, but…
"But." There's always a but, Roby.
I did what I could.
What I knew.
I mean, I must've done something good too.
And I can finally tell you.
Tell me what? That you're not my dad?
That you were good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
-Good morning! -Good morning.
How much?
-Fifty, please. -Very well.
You can pay at the cashier inside.
I'll go.
Good, you pay.
These are the 23 players called up for the Korea and Japan World Cup.
-Yes, Roberto Baggio is out… -He's crazy. How can you not take Baggio?
He's leaving the best one home.
Coach Trapattoni decided to leave him behind.
-Good morning. -Good morning.
Fifty euros on pump four.
Thank you.
We thank our correspondent.
I fear this choice won't be very popular with the Italians…
Sign here.
Roby,
thank you for everything.
Thank you.
Bye.
Guys, is that Baggio?
What do you mean, Baggio?
-Was it really Baggio? -Yes.
Roberto Baggio!
Roberto!
Roby.
-You're awesome. -Thank you. More than twenty years in football…
He should've called you up, Roberto.
-He should've. -Thanks.
More than twenty years Waiting for that penalty…
You're awesome, Roberto!
Roberto Baggio! To discover that life…
Thank you.
Was the full game
Was in the ray of sunshine… Roberto Baggio!
That fired up your childhood dreams
It was in the wind That moved your ponytail
And to us that was already A sign of the divine
It was finding a place
In the middle of an endless field
And finding the joy
When time seemed to have run out
It was falling and getting up Accepting the pain
Feeling like an embrace Coming from the heart
Of those who saw you Enchant the world with a football
Without ever hiding The man behind the champ…
Thank you to my teacher of life Daisaku Ikeda,
to my parents, to my wife Andreina,
to my three wonderful children,
to my three wonderful children, and to all the people with whom I created a deep bond of affection and friendship.
And then there's all the passion
And that blind and crazy determination
So the destination
Sometimes is an obsession…
BAGGIO IS NUMBER ONE!
And scars and trophies…
We'd like to give our infinite thanks to Sensei Ikeda and his wife
for this acknowledgment, that makes us really happy,
which we want to dedicate and share with all the fellow believers in Italy.
In the middle of an endless field
To find the joy
When time seemed to have run out
One of the best careers in the history of Italian football ends here.
Leaving the field for the last time,
maybe the most beloved player in Italian football,
surely one of the best of all time.
The man behind the champ
You know, Roberto After all, all this love
It's the fruit of the courage
Of the champ who touched every ball
As if it was life
I know, it can seem an exaggeration
But even that penalty
And action!
[man 1] This is very much a Breaking Bad movie.
It feels a bit like Old Home Week. It feels a bit like déjà vu.
[man 2] Vince runs such an incredible ship.
It feels good to be back in his camp.
[woman] We've come back together around five years after wrapping the last season of Breaking Bad.
It was one of the great conclusions ever to a TV series,
and to continue the story was amazing.
[Mike] Only you can decide what's best for you, Jesse.
Not sure I should stick around town.
That's a start.
[Aaron] I knew that this story started with where we left off in Breaking Bad,
but I had no idea where it was heading.
[Vince] We were very protective of the script.
The actors had to come to us
and read the one copy we kept under lock and key.
After reading the script,
I get a deeper look at what truly was going on
within that concrete hole that the Nazis held Jesse in.
You're given little tidbits that you never knew you missed
that sort of alter the end of the show in some way.
Good behavior. Right?
I think the story of this film is really about the struggle to survive.
You know, it follows a man on the run,
who will truly stop at nothing to finally become free.
You're apexing too early. You're apexing too early!
I'm apexing at the apex, bitch. Don't be telling me how to drive and shit.
You couldn't drive a two-button elevator.
You couldn't drive Miss Daisy.
-Whatever that means. -[Jesse grunting]
[Aaron] The first day on set was with Skinny Pete and Badger.
It was nice to have that trio back together.
Feel like a new man?
Yeah. Thanks.
We did our first scene with Aaron, and it was like, "Oh, yeah. This."
It wasn't weird.
It was just more like-- Immediately we're like, "I miss this."
You take my car.
I don't even like your car.
It drives like a dick.
[Matt] We're the paragons of innocence.
We're not bad guys. We're just Jesse's friends.
[Skinny Pete] Just might keep you from getting spotted.
Yo, Skinny.
Why you doing all this?
Dude...
you're my hero and shit.
[Aaron] Look at that slow... like, push-in.
You can feel it.
It's so good, how close he is.
[Aaron] Obviously, we thought this thing was done,
but it still very much lives and breathes in all of us.
It was worth the 21 takes. I'll tell you that.
So much time had passed, but we're all still so close.
And so, it's just like old friends coming together.
[man] I'm kind of indentured to Vince Gilligan.
So I get a note that says, "You'll be there," and here I am.
[man 1] They call you up, and they say,
"Vince Gilligan wants to have you in another project."
And everybody says, "Excellent."
I said, "Cool."
They said, "But you can't tell anybody about this."
People started asking me, "Hey, what are you doing?"
I said, "I can't tell you," and that's cool.
This is some top-secret shit.
[woman] I got the script,
and I was so thrilled to be able to see the next chapter,
and what he goes through, and how Jane is a part of that for him.
I was sitting next to my wife.
I said, "Hon, you're not gonna believe this.
Mr. Pinkman lives."
-[laughing] -And so, it was totally thrilling.
It was really good. It was great.
It was like coming home.
It was like going back to your high school reunion
if your high school sold meth.
Okay, picture is up. Here we go.
[Vince] The core crew of Breaking Bad and then Better Call Saul
is also the core crew of this movie.
I have a great team.
I mean, everybody here... This is the greatest crew ever.
People like to say that they have wonderful crews.
This crew really is extraordinary, and it is a family of sorts.
Everybody here is so devoted.
They're here because they couldn't not be a part of telling this story,
And to see this script come to life in a film like a real western
was really spectacular.
We get to showcase landscapes like here in the Painted Desert.
It's beautiful.
[Jesse Plemons] The cinematography has been incredible.
There were some moments out in the Painted Desert
that just felt... classic.
[Vince] Marshall Adams, our amazing DP,
is also a drone pilot,
and we've got some shots from, you know, a couple hundred feet up.
In the old days, we would have sent a crew over there and had them hike up the mountain.
To have the opportunity to come in and have a 46-day schedule
allows Vince to put something on the screen that's gonna be more epic than the TV series ever was.
[woman] My favorite thing to do in makeup is character work,
and that's why I love this movie, because there are so many transitions
that Jesse Pinkman goes through.
We definitely needed to reference the show for all these flashbacks.
So we literally would be at home on a big screen
with a... [chuckles] camera phone, and going back through the episodes
with a... [chuckles] camera phone, and going back through the episodes and going, "Stop, stop, stop!" and taking screenshots.
We tried to remain true and authentic
to what the Breaking Bad characters originally wore.
And those clothes don't exist anymore.
So we got to rebuild them.
This particular shirt here is a shirt
that Jesse Pinkman wears in the actual series
that no longer exist in stores.
So it consists of three different shirts that we pieced together.
One sleeve, one shirt, one collar.
[woman] It's kind of nice to actually have a sense of the characters,
as opposed to most films where you come in blind.
My stuff is gonna fit you like a T, yo.
Not like if you had to borrow it from Sasquatch over here.
Can't help it that I'm sized for love.
[Lily] When Jesse comes out of captivity, he goes by Skinny Pete's house.
So, Skinny Pete sets him up with clothes.
They have to change him so he can be incognito.
So we don't really get a sense of his own look for most of the film.
Maybe don't, like, shave and whatnot, you know?
Uh, be less... recognizable?
For this particular film, we are jumping all over the place.
And therefore, we have a bunch of wigs in all different lengths.
You know, it takes a village.
[Lori] We have him everywhere. We have him hit with a fire hose.
We have him in a shower.
And he actually, like, took his hands and went... like he's washing his hair.
I'm like, "Ah!"
It withstood it, but you're like this. Like...
What are you better at, going forwards or backwards?
Okay, well, let's both go sideways for a while.
[Aaron] I haven't played a Jesse and Todd scene in years.
We definitely get a deeper look inside of... Todd's mind.
[Jesse Plemons] First and foremost,
I was very happy to finally know what kind of music Todd listens to,
which is, like, 70's yacht rock.
[Jesse Plemons] I was worried beforehand as to whether or not he was still in there,
or I could remember what I did six years ago.
Seeing the shape Jesse is in...
definitely jogged my memory. [chuckling]
The way he plays Todd is not menacing.
You know, when he does certain looks, it sends chills down my spine,
but he's smiling at me.
I think Jesse's part his pet,
and he thinks that what he's doing is best for him,
-even if Jesse doesn't realize it. -[whistles]
He's just missing certain common human emotions. [chuckles]
How you like my place?
Uh, yeah, it's-- it's nice.
Kinda... pastel.
We are on the set of Todd Alquist's apartment,
and, uh, I love this. This tickles me.
It's a third floor apartment in real life.
And so, they built the whole set on this, uh, riser that takes it four feet off the ground.
Todd is a really interesting character.
Outwardly, he's very polite, he's considerate,
and he genuinely feels bad
when he kills or hurts someone, or something.
Where are we gonna... take her?
Someplace pretty.
She deserves that.
[Judy] When you first walk into his home, it is very sunny.
It's very PAAS Easter egg pallet.
But then he has this whole other dark side that can flip very quickly,
and that's where we end up in his bedroom.
You come across the darker side of him.
The scorpion chair was something that Vince had brought to the table,
and then the snow globes were really about his personality.
I mean, it's hard to pick a favorite, you know?
[Jesse Plemons] So, the baby is eating a snake? [man] Oh, yeah.
As you can see, he's got some interesting taste.
[Judy] They are kind of cheerful,
and they're this sort of happy souvenir that you give as gifts,
but upon closer inspection,
you see that they're slightly off, slightly twisted.
I mean, I love this one 'cause there's something...
so it's not just cute. There's something off-putting.
Vince's note was to add something even weirder to it.
Like, you know, some random, little fishbowl.
It's not at all what I envisioned,
but Todd with money, that's what you get.
Yeah, no crazy in this house.
Perfectly normal.
Hey, Jesse-- Aaron, rather.
Keep doing what you're doing.
Keep doing that. Tap your hand on that wall
and shine your light.
We are finishing up the big search,
as Jesse has spent 16, 18 hours straight tearing this place apart
looking for the money.
We're in between takes on this crazy shot, looking straight down from the rafters.
You can see the camera way up there, 40, 45 feet up.
[Aaron] It was Judy's idea to build Todd's apartment
the exact same size as the frame of the camera.
Just watching Jesse desperately searching for this money is beautiful.
You can see from here already how we're gonna shoot the stage.
And if we go all the way up, we'll be able to see it completely.
When I first read the script,
I saw his character searching throughout the apartment
as a mouse within a maze,
and I thought how cool it would be to then pull up
to see the maze, to really show that he had searched everywhere.
You have 90 minutes of takes, and the whole thing will get boiled down
into you searching for maybe 15, 20 seconds of screen time.
The greatest 15 to 20 seconds of screen time ever.
Yeah!
[Judy] The compound lab we had to recreate,
we couldn't go back to the original place 'cause it was completely leveled.
So we had to just basically use the drawings, the screengrabs,
and whatever information you can cobble together to recreate it.
[Vince] It's a lot of the original equipment from Breaking Bad.
As a matter of fact,
Walter White's bloody handprint is still on one of the cooking vessels.
Technically, it's not supposed to be there
because this is before all those events happened,
but, uh, I didn't have the heart to-- to clean it off.
That's a little Easter egg
if you can spot it in the finished footage.
Part of it felt like you never left.
You know, this set is exactly what it was when we were here six years ago.
Kenny, if he breaks his leg, he's not gonna be able to cook.
What, are you the fucking HR department? Jesus, Toddie, relax.
Tell you what. Everybody freeze.
And let's have focus on... on, uh, Scott.
I was a Breaking Bad fan. So much so, that the first three days of my honeymoon with my wife,
we actually stayed in the hotel room watching season three.
Of course, being a fan of the show, leading up to this production,
you realize these characters are operating
from moment-to-moment to fulfill their needs.
And whether they're betraying a value or not
isn't necessarily the compass they're using.
And Vince's ability to just continually escalate the world,
he gives you so much that you just hope to keep the ball in the air for him.
You ready?
Yeah.
[Aaron] I love Krysten Ritter so much.
I haven't played a Jesse and Jane scene in ten years,
because, you know, Jane met her demise in season two.
[Krysten] I love the relationship between Jane and Jesse,
and I love that we get to see a scene and see a side that we didn't see in series.
It's not every day that a show that is that huge and successful
gets to come back and take a little victory lap.
This is definitely a film for the fans. And for everybody. It's for everybody.
-Except kids. [laughing] -Yeah, don't bring your kids.
It's been surreal and a lot of fun to go back in time like this.
I think all of our fans will just be so thrilled
[narrator] Four years ago, Nick and Audrey Spitz solved some of the most high-profile murders of the century.
[Audrey] Oh my God! Oh my God!
-Should we pull it out? -No, it's a foot-long knife.
-[all screaming] -I'll put it back in. -Don't put it back. -[all moaning and yelling]
[narrator] Like many overnight success stories,
Nick and Audrey immediately quit their jobs
and poured their life savings into pursuing a career as private investigators.
-Yeah. -Would you excuse me?
Mm. Yes, not a problem.
Are you kidding me right now with those potato chips?
Are you seriously yelling at me? I watched you eat two shrimp cocktails.
Stop distracting me. Okay?
[narrator] Unfortunately, it's not going very well.
Men get to a certain stage in their life. It's nothing to do with you.
Not all men.
-No, but-- -Don't get mad at me for this.
-[door closes] -[woman] You've been cheating on me, Ron.
-Really? After 25 years? -[sighs]
[Ron] Baby…
I've been going out on my own so I could plan a surprise wedding anniversary.
-No, that's so sweet! -That's…
-[Ron] Come on. I love you. -I'm so sorry.
Excuse us, you guys.
If you don't mind just paying this bill, we'll be out of your lovebuggin' hair.
-A bill? You're billing her? -Yeah, no.
We made a deal-- You were hitting on me!
-I was undercover. -Pretend--
This keeps getting better and better.
[narrator] With business struggling, Nick and Audrey
[narrator] With business struggling, Nick and Audrey could only pray for a miracle…
You better run!
…that someone close to them would be killed.
Oh God!
Honey, honey, honey. Hey!
Can't you put on beach waves or something nice?
[Nick] The whale noises help me fall asleep.
-You took away my Ambien, so… -[Audrey] You know why?
Remember the last time you took Ambien?
You went sleepwalking into the lobby
wearing my underwear, and then you started watering the couch.
I don't remember doing that.
Look. Doorman took a picture. It's my screen saver.
-Uh, that's somebody else. -[Audrey] Okay.
Listen, baby, if you can't sleep, um,
we could try to, uh, knock out a chapter together.
[Nick] I read a few pages.
That guy doesn't know what he's talking about.
[Audrey] Honey, this is the guy that wrote the test.
The test you need to take to get licensed.
[Nick] I was a real cop.
I don't need some piece of paper telling me I know what I'm doing.
I know what I'm doing!
But we both agreed that it would help our business
But we both agreed that it would help our business if we just, you know, took the course.
Do you really think our business is struggling because of that?
I think we would get better clientele if both of us were licensed.
Only way to get better clientele is better marketing.
Better marketing? Like your floss business cards?
-Yes. -[Audrey] Seriously? God!
It's called "disruptive marketing."
It's not disruptive. It's confusing. We're not dentists. We're--
I can talk louder than the sound machine.
-[volume increasing] -[Audrey] Honey, come on!
[Nick] Fine. Forget it.
Do you not wanna do this anymore?
I do. I wanna do this. It's just…
It's all we ever do is talk about work.
Do you know any couples who also work together that actually get along?
Billie Eilish and Finneas.
They're brother and sister.
Look, baby, I know this isn't what we pictured when we got into this--
What the hell is that?
Uh, it's my phone.
Yo! Rajah! Namaste. What's up, my brother?
[Maharajah] Yo! What are you doing, Nicky Nick?
Are you mowing your lawn or something? What do I hear right now?
Yo, I'm chillin' on a Jet Ski, dog! [laughs]
On a Jet Ski and on the phone at the same time?
[Maharajah] Yo, Nick. Broski. My brosephus.
The Maharajah is getting married!
Oh, that's incredible!
Let me tell Audrey. Audrey!
Let me tell Audrey. Audrey! He's getting married.
-What? -[Nick] Oh yeah.
Vik! Congratulations! We're so happy for you!
Thank you! She's a dime piece from Paris.
You know, where the Eiffel Tower is and shit.
I'm getting married this weekend on my new private island.
I want you and Nick to come, all expenses paid.
I need to see you two ballers out on the dance floor busting a nut!
"Busting a move," you mean.
Nah, dude, I got… Oh shit!
Oh shit!
-[line disconnects] -What's happening?
Did you hear "all-expenses-paid"?
-We have to work this weekend. -I gotta say, I could use a getaway.
Remember what happened last time we went on a getaway?
Yeah, some people died.
Not s-- A lot of people.
You think five people dying's a lot?
All right. Hold on. Just gonna think for a second.
-She's caving in. -Okay, so…
-She's caving in. -Just wait.
No. Go ahead.
Okay, I do agree.
I think we could both use a little bit of a break.
-A break? -From all this.
-Just no work for a minute, you know? -Not-- -It's-- -No. For at least a weekend.
The whole weekend. We can… Let's not… Let's just…
The whole weekend. We can… Let's not… Let's just… Our minds need the no work.
-I can't talk-- -I got chills! Goosebumps!
'Cause we're gonna do this, aren't we?
-Wow. How about that. Mm-hmm. -Such a good decision.
You like the view, Mr. and Mrs. Shitz?
Oh. You know what? Excuse me. I'm so sorry. It's… We're Nick and Audrey Spitz. It's, um…
But, yes, it's a gorgeous view.
Would you like some music, Mr. and Mrs. Shitz?
We're the Spitzes not the Shitzes. Okay?
Yes, I have some Pitbull or, uh, Taylor Shitz.
-Okay. He's sticking with the Shitz. -Puts "Shitz" at the end of everything.
Where are you from?
I'm, uh, from the, uh… European!
We're guessing Shitzerland?
♪ Tell your mom, girl, and I won't stop it Until you're mine, girl ♪ ♪ And you can't stop that Until you're mine, girl, ha ♪
[Nick] Let me get off this. What the heck? Thank you!
[Audrey] This is unbelievable! I'm gonna cry!
-Did we die? Are we in heaven? What the-- -[gasps] This is so nice!
The flamingos got diapers on so they don't crap the lawn!
[Vik shouting] Nick and Audrey!
-Hey! My man! -Hey, hey, hey!
-Maharajah! -[Vik] The heroes of Lake Como!
And my sister and my brother from another mother!
-[continues exclaiming] -[Audrey] Oh my God! -Hey! Oh my God! -[all whooping]
-Hey! Oh my God! -[all whooping] -[Nick] Look at you! -Oh!
Nick and Audrey, may I present to you Mademoiselle Claudette Joubert.
[in French] Joubert.
[in English] I'm Audrey. It is such a pleasure to meet you.
You are more beautiful than Vikram described.
-That's funny. Got 'em all. -Oh!
Four? I thought it was two.
And Nick.
-I've been wanting to meet you. -All right!
Congratulations.
Thank you. I appreciate that. Yeah. I love it.
-Okay! All right, stop! -[Nick] What happened?
[Audrey] Cut it out!
[Claudette] Please, come.
[Audrey] I have to tell you, Paris is my favorite city in the world.
-When was the last time you were there? -Hmm. Oh, I've actually not been there.
But I just know from the movies and from the pictures and--
[Nick] Hey, thanks for the wedding invite. So happy you could squeeze us in.
-[Vik] No, for sure, man! -Unbelievable!
We had extra seats 'cause my parents died.
-Ooh! I'm-- -Oh! I'm so sorry.
[Nick] That's terrible.
[laughs] No! I'm just kidding!
Oh, okay. So, they're coming?
Uh, no, they died, but they were never gonna come.
'Cause I hated them.
-There you go. All right. That's-- -Okay.
Oh. Colonel, you know the Spitzes.
-What? -Colonel!
My friends!
-My God! -Oh my God. What happened to your arm?
Is it that noticeable?
Last time we saw you, you had a lot more of… of your arm.
Well, if I had to lose one, that would be the one to lose
because it's already missing a hand.
You don't have to share the armrest now at the movie theater.
-[all chuckle] -Yo, yo, yo. But real talk.
The Colonel stopped a bullet meant for me in Mumbai.
-You kidding? -Somebody tried to shoot you?
Yeah. Some people don't like the way my company does business.
Sadly, the Colonel's injury stops him from protecting me to the fullest,
so I had to get me a new head bodyguard.
Mr. Louis!
-Check it out, right? -[Audrey] Hello, Louis!
And, yo, my man is fully armed.
[Nick] He's fully armed. That's funny!
Okay. I hope you don't find anything in there.
-I hope not! -[all laugh]
I hate to say it.
If you and the Colonel are ever caught in a fight, my money's on the Colonel.
He'd open a can of whoop ass with his, uh… with his good arm.
No? You didn't like that one? I was joking around.
-Nice to meet you. -Let's go.
Follow me.
[Nick] Coming. Coming.
[Nick] Sounds great!
[Claudette] I'm assuming you've never been to an Indian wedding before.
-[laughing] Why would you assume that? -Oh, so you have?
Uh, no.
So tonight is the Sangeet. It's like a rehearsal dinner.
And then we have, um, a very dramatic surprise entrance plan
that I think you'll find quite entertaining.
-[phone rings] -[Claudette] I need to take this.
Your villa should have everything you need. Make yourselves at home.
-And we-- -Bye! Enjoy!
-Bye. Thank you. -No more kisses. Cool.
[sighs] She was working in a watch shop off La Place Vendôme when I met her.
Not a penny to her name.
Love at first sight, you know what I mean?
She just fills me with like… [grunts] -With happiness. -[Nick] That's nice.
I see that same happiness in you two when you look at each other.
You guys are happy, right?
-Us? Are you kidding? -Without her, I would not be happy. -With her, I'm the happiest. -Not a day goes by where I just wanna go…
-With her, I'm the happiest. -Not a day goes by where I just wanna go… [grunts] I love you so much.
She makes every decision for us, and I'm fine with that.
-Now get in there and have fun, all right? -[Nick] Thank you so much.
-[Vik] Enjoy yourself. -Okay. Oh, so we…
-[Vik] Enjoy yourself. -Okay. Oh, so we… -Okay. Bye, buddy! -[Vik] Louis, let's go.
-Okay. Bye, buddy! -[Vik] Louis, let's go.
Oh my God!
I mean, goddamn. Goddamn!
Look at this! Oh my God!
-[Nick] Look at this! This! -[Audrey] Wow!
-[Nick] Babe, the TV's gigantic! -Oh my God.
-[Nick] Look at this thing! -[beeps]
What?!
We got a convertible, baby!
Put this… in your face.
Is this unicorn cheese?
-Oh my God. Baby, a gift box. -Okay.
I'm gonna go with one more piece of cheese, then I'm done with this.
-[Audrey] What? Are these for us? -[Nick] Earrings?
-[Audrey] Oh! -These are good ones, aren't they?
I cannot believe this!
-We get our own iPhones! -No way!
-What did we give out at our wedding? -Oh, flip-flops!
Flip-flops, and we gave out Advil or some shit?
-Vintage Air Jordans? -[Audrey] This is insane! [Nick] My size?
Wouldn't be a gift box from the Maharajah if it didn't have something kinky in it.
-Those are gonna get you in trouble. -You promise?
-Oh! I like that response. Okay. -Hey!
-What? -[Nick] Okay.
[Audrey] Wait. We just… This has just happened.
-How'd they do that so fast? -It's incredible.
[Audrey] Honey! It says "Nick and Audrey"!
-Oh my God! You gotta come in this bed! -[Nick] I'm coming, baby!
-[Audrey] Oh! -[Nick] I'm coming! I'm coming! Hey!
Oh my God! Ow! Baby!
-Oh gosh. -All right. What?
I don't know if I packed appropriately for this event.
-I gotta check. -I'm coming with! -[Audrey] I gotta check. -[Nick] I'm coming with! Let's go!
-[Audrey] I gotta check. -[Nick] I'm coming with! Let's go!
-Oh my God! -Okay, that's good.
That's your stuff. Yeah.
Do you see this? -I've never seen anything-- -All right.
-[Audrey] Baby, you look so handsome. -I…
I can't believe you pulled that off.
-Well, I'm gonna pull that off. -[Audrey] Let's go.
[Nick] Please tell me you're gonna keep that.
Oh my God!
-[Audrey] Hi! -[Nick] Hey, how are ya?
Audrey!
-[Audrey] Ah, Colonel! -[Nick] Hey.
-Stunning! -Thank you!
Oh, how handsome are you, man?
I only have eye for you, Nick.
Oh! You better keep it that way! All right!
In a most beautiful place on a most beautiful night,
you have to be the most beautiful thing of all.
Whoa. Okay. Definitely kissing every single finger I have.
I have made love to more than 10,000 women.
-[Audrey murmurs] -None as ravishing as you.
Okay. Well, speaking of staggering numbers, this is my husband of 16 years.
I've made love to one woman. -And I did it terribly, by the way. -[Audrey] All right.
Holy sh-- This is… You're that guy, Francisco Perez, yeah?
This guy used to be a soccer player.
He headbutted some dude one time and put him into a coma.
Yeah. I know. I hit him so hard, he lost his ability to blink.
Anyway, it was so nice to meet you. So, we're go--
What about you? How do you know the Maharajah?
Well, after I retired from football,
his father made me the chairman of the board of directors
of Shiz-Vik, his company.
Also, I helped him land that beautiful bride of his, the blonde. [chuckles]
Although she has nothing on this one. My God.
-Okay. -Okay.
I'll see you in a second.
$10,000, you can have one night with her.
I'm kidding, you sick bastard.
[woman] That's quite the plate.
Do they not have food where you come from?
No, you know, I just… I'm so used to my husband just eating off my plate,
so it's sort of become a habit.
But, no, you're absolutely right. I don't need this.
No, no, no! Don't put it back.
-I was not gonna do that. -[woman scoffs]
Americans.
Would you care for one?
Oh, I'm so good. Thank you. Maybe another time.
-[Audrey] So, um… -Thank you. Are you on the bride's side?
No, I'm Saira, groom's sister.
I did not know Vik had a sister.
Yeah. [chuckles]
-These are very low tables! -[chuckles]
Are you reading 'cause you don't like weddings like this, or…
No, you know, it's more that I don't like people.
I mean, these people in particular.
I guess as long as Claudette and your brother have fun, that's all that matters.
Right. I don't really understand how anyone gets married.
Spending so much time with one person. Can you imagine?
Well, speaking of my one person,
there he is.
Nick, this is Saira.
This is Vik's sister.
-Would you… -[Saira] No.
-You good? -[Audrey] She's good.
-I am Nick. Nice to meet you. -Saira.
Love your brother, by the way. -He's hysterical. -[Saira] Right.
Oh boy.
Okay, if you're trying to seduce me, it's really not working.
Oh my God.
Hey, Nick. I was just thinking about your lovely wife.
Oh, you again.
I see you've already met Francisco.
And I guess you're both acquainted with Vikram's harpy of a sister.
-Did he say "herpe"? -Harpy.
Countess! How humiliating it must be for you to see Claudette
Countess! How humiliating it must be for you to see Claudette actually close a deal with the Maharajah.
Ever wonder what you might have done wrong, dear?
Ever wonder what it feels like to be tall enough to ride a rollercoaster?
That's Countess Sekou.
She's Vik's ex-fiancée,
and she's Claudette's old university roommate.
And they're still friends? She's quite rude, by the way.
Well, on top of all that, she's also Claudette's maid of honor.
-[Audrey] What? -Yeah.
[man over PA] Hope you watched the video because the dancing is about to begin!
-What dancing? -I'm gonna fake going to the bathroom.
-I don't dance. You dance. -I didn't get a video. Did you?
They brought one to the room. -I forgot to tell you. -Thanks.
-I forgot to tell you. -Thanks.
[man over PA] Ladies and gentlemen, please help me welcome the bride!
Come with us!
All right, come on!
-Come on, baby! -[screams]
[over PA] And now it's time!
The moment you've all been waiting for.
The groom, Vikram Govindan!
This is crazy!
Brother!
Back! Get everybody back! Get everybody back!
[guard] Stay back!
Vik!
-[Nick] Okay, all right. -[Claudette shrieks]
[Claudette] Is he dead?
It's not him. It's not Vik.
Oh, thank God! It's only Mr. Lou.
-Who did this to you? -[Claudette] Where is Vik? Hey!
-Who did this to you? -[Claudette] Where is Vik? Hey! [Audrey] Who? What? Oh my gosh!
Where is Vik?
-Who did this to you? -Who was it? Do you remember?
It was…
[Nick] Say it. Say it. Don't die. Don't die!
-[Audrey] Oh my gosh! -[Claudette] Where is Vik?
[guard 1] Clear! Clear! Come on!
-Come on! Come on! Come on! Go! -[guard 2] Clear!
-[Nick] This is a distraction. -[Audrey] From what?
-[Nick] This is a distraction. -[Audrey] From what? From the escape!
-[Colonel] Are you serious? -[shutter clicks] What do you mean all communication systems are down?
Get them up and running!
We have a security officer compromised. We need medical attention immediately.
[sighs] Okay.
[Vik] Help!
Yo, you hatin’ hard on me right now, son!
-Homeboy! -[Vik] Nick!
[Vik yelling] Nick!
This is some janky-ass shit!
[Colonel] Lock down the island
until the security cameras are back online.
All guests are to remain in their rooms.
Oh my God. We need to get ahead of this, or our shares will plummet.
My brother could be dead and the only thing you're concerned about are share prices?
How do you think our investors will react when news of this gets out,
you little Miss Minority Shareholder?
Giving all her money to save the whales and heal the planet
and all that nonsense.
Colonel. Where is Vik?
Where is my husband?
[Colonel] We will find him. We will find him.
The Maharajah's been kidnapped.
-What? -[Countess] Oh my God!
-Where did they take him? -[Nick] He's alive.
Somebody with a machine gun threw him on a boat, and they took off.
-How many kidnappers? -[Nick] One.
Which means his partner is still here on the island.
Hold on. How do you know there were two?
If the kidnapper had Vik and was taking him to the boat…
Ah, someone else was leading the elephant into the tent.
-Thank you. -There are 400 people on this island.
That's a lot of suspects.
Let us narrow it down for you, okay, Colonel?
Claudette, how many people knew about the elephant being part of the ceremony?
Just the board.
Yeah, we had to sign off at the expense of transporting an elephant.
So that means all of you.
What are you implying?
I think it's very obvious what I'm implying.
-[Nick] Mm-hmm. -One of you is an accomplice to a murder.
-That is ridiculous! -I'm not on the board!
Is it? You all hated my brother!
What? No, I… I love Vik.
[scoffs] Oh, please!
-You've never forgiven me. -For what?
-Breaking up your engagement. -Oh, get over yourself.
It was an arranged marriage between our families.
We amicably split in order to allow for your so-called "love marriage."
You didn't want this marriage to go through so you kidnapped him!
You gold-digging-- -Ladies, stop it! -Calm down, everybody!
-Ladies, stop it! -Calm down, everybody!
-We do this for a living. It's what we do. -[Nick] It's our thing.
-And this is not just another case. -No.
-[Nick] This is personal. -[Audrey] Yeah, it's Vik.
-[Nick] He means a lot to us. -[Audrey] So we'll find out who did this.
-[Nick] A hundred percent. -[Audrey] And find out why they did this.
And we're gonna get Vik back, okay?
We're gonna do this for the low, low price of $25 million.
Twenty-five mil, honey. I swear to God.
[Nick] I would've settled for ten grand.
So insane.
What are you doing?
[Nick] I'm blocking the door so no one can get in.
[Audrey] Honey, you're gonna hurt your back.
You know what would hurt my back? A knife going through it.
The killer knows we're on to him.
We're on the next-to-kill list. I guarantee it.
What happened to Vik?
A guy that rich gets kidnapped for the money.
There's no profit in hurting him.
Oh God. We're not gonna be invited anywhere ever again. Ever again.
The cheese has a hold on me, honey. I can't stop.
Are you just… Will you take a slice like a civilized person?
I don't know where the knife is. -Oh Jesus! -[Nick] What? You got a headache?
-Oh Jesus! -[Nick] What? You got a headache?
-Yes! -[Nick] I'm sorry.
-How's your back? -My back's killing me.
-I'll get Advil. -Please. Please.
-I'm gonna get more cheese in me. -Honey, do not eat all that cheese.
That affects… You're terrible all night.
-Absolutely. -Oh.
And I have pictures from the tent of a burned robe with bloodstains.
Someone was trying to get rid of the evidence,
and I'm sure it was the elephant handler.
Good detecting, sweetheart.
-I'm doing my best. Here. -[Nick] Okay. Thank you.
-[Audrey] One, two, three, four. -[Nick] Okay.
[Nick] I gotta move this stuff now?
What if that's the killer?
-Killers don't knock. -What if it's housekeeping?
We… We're good! We don't need any towels.
No! No! We do need towels. Leave 'em out front, please!
We've been here ten minutes. You need more towels?
You use 30 towels after every shower.
I'm sorry. At least I shower.
All right, you got me there.
[Francisco] It's me, Francisco!
Francisco?
Wait, wait, wait. What if he's the killer?
The only thing he wants to murder is your hm-hm!
Hey!
-[Francisco] Hurry! There's no time! -[Nick] Be right there!
-[Audrey] We're hurrying! -[Nick] We know!
So sorry.
-You. -[Nick] Mm-hmm.
Gorgeous.
[Nick] Jesus Christ. All right.
[Audrey] Put this back. You said hurry.
What's… How can we help?
-I have information. -[Nick] Yes.
Everyone thinks Claudette is this gold digger,
but what's not so well known is the fact that, as a precaution,
but what's not so well known is the fact that, as a precaution, the board made her sign a brutal prenup.
the board made her sign a brutal prenup.
So that means if Vik divorces her, she's left with nothin'.
-I gotta move this shit again? -Wait. Wait. Who is it?
[Claudette] It's Claudette. You must hear what I have to say.
Okay, one second.
Let's get you in the closet.
[Nick] Okay, be right there. I gotta get some cheese.
-Okay. Just go in there. -[rock scraping floor]
No! Get off of… Jesus!
-Coming, Claudette! -Sorry! One second.
[Nick] Hurry!
-[Audrey] Hello, Claudette. -[Nick] Hi.
[Claudette] They all think I'm marrying Vik just for the money, especially the Countess.
just for the money, especially the Countess.
She's been jealous of me ever since we met.
-Really? I can imagine why. -I can imagine.
But still, she was my best friend.
-Right. -[Nick] Sure.
-You know? -Yeah.
-We were so close. -[Audrey] Oh!
And I think I just miss her sometimes.
-Oh, sorry. -[Claudette sobbing]
-I just wanna know who kidnapped my Vik. -Mm-hmm.
They all have something to gain from this.
-Terrible. -[Claudette] I can't trust any of them!
-[whispers] There's a gun. -A gun?
[Claudette] The Colonel, so bitter about his demotion.
Saira, always starved for attention.
And Vik had just discovered Francisco's dark secret.
-[Audrey] What? -[Nick] He had a secret?
-Oh! -[Nick] Oh God.
-[Audrey] We don't need to do that. -[Nick] That's cool.
Who is it?
It's Saira. Let me in.
Uh, okay. One second.
-I need to hide. The closet! -No, no, no!
-[Nick] It's too dark. -Here. Come on.
-[Nick] She has all her stuff. -One second, Saira!
[Nick] Coming! Be right there!
Okay, gotta get to you!
-So sorry. One second. -Moving around some stuff for fun!
-I know who you need to be looking at. -[Nick] Who?
-Claudette! -[Nick] Claudette?
[Saira] I told Vik she was bad news the minute I met her.
She's suspicious, narcissistic, manipulative,
and looks cheap as well in that red dress--
Excuse me! I'm so sorry to interrupt, but I feel like I'd be a rude hostess
if I didn't offer you a piece of this exquisite artisan cheese that's…
Nick, where's this… Where's that cheese? The big--
-The cheese is gone. -Where is it?
I put it, uh, in my stomach.
You ate that entire block of cheese?
Trying to shame me. I don't know if that's gonna get the cheese back--
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be selfish--
Sorry. Hold on. You know what?
Let me give you a drink right now just to relax you a little bit.
-Here. -I… I don't want that.
-No? Okay. -I'm okay.
-Oh shit. -[Saira] Who is it?
-[Audrey] Not sure. -You expecting someone?
It's like an after-party. People just show up.
Let's put you into the bedroom, just in case, 'cause I don't know.
-I'll hide there. -Don't hide in there! Why?
-I'll hide there. -Don't hide in there! Why? That's an obvious spot.
-[Audrey] Is it hot in here? -I'm hot too.
-[Audrey] Is it hot in here? -I'm hot too. -I'm coming! -[knocking continues]
What if that is the killer?
Don't you kinda want it to be the killer so they can kill us?
I am sick of this shit.
-Baby, I do not feel very good. -[rock scraping]
What's doin'? Yeah?
Hey, great to see you.
What's going on? [chuckles lightly]
[Countess] I know who did it.
Who?
It was Francisco.
Francisco!
He has had over 85 paternity suits filed against him.
We suspect he's been siphoning money out of the company
in order to pay for all of these babies he made.
That's a lie!
Not the part about the babies.
Yes, that's true. I've spread my seed far and wide,
but I have never stolen in my life.
-What are you doing here? -An excellent question.
-What are you all doing here? -Saira's here.
-Nobody move! -Oh my God!
I ain't moving.
It's mine. It's mine.
-I missed it. -[Nick] Missed the call?
I have a message.
[distorted voice] We have the Maharajah.
If you contact the authorities, he dies.
We'll make our demands known to you at 7:00 a.m.
That voice is hysterical. You got to admit it.
So we should all stay here. Correct, Colonel?
Because one of us is definitely working with the kidnapper.
Yeah. Motives, opportunities.
Somebody here.
My head is spinning a little bit.
Honey?
Babe, are you taking a nap? I'm tired, too, so let's, uh…
Nobody leave here until we figure out who did what.
It's great to see everybody. -Thanks for coming over. Sorry, my bad. -[Francisco] Whoa!
[yelps] Jesus! What?
Oh my God. Nick?
-[Nick] Yeah. -Nick?
[Nick] Yeah?
-[Audrey] Nick! -Uh-huh.
Nicky, honey. Get up. Get up! We got roofied.
-What happened? -[Audrey] Baby. Oh my God! We fell asleep!
-[Nick] Oh yeah? -Honey! [Nick] We're sleeping now.
I don't know what happened. Uh, I…
-Come on! Get up, Nick! -[Nick] Okay. Up. I'm up.
[Audrey] Who did this?
[Nick] What? Now they're just showing off.
-[Audrey] Hurry up! -[Nick] Okay, I'm coming, honey. So…
-[Audrey] Get up! -[Nick] I'm up!
-Calm down before you say anything. -Nobody drugs us and gets away with it!
-Maybe they didn't drug us. -It's illegal!
Maybe we just ate too much. -That's why we passed out. -Nick. Audrey. Just in time.
-That's why we passed out. -Nick. Audrey. Just in time.
-For what? -For what?
The real detectives have just arrived.
[Colonel] Connor Miller.
-[Audrey gasps] -Former MI6 hostage negotiator.
Oh my God. Specializes in high-profile cases.
He got the President of Uruguay's son back from the cartel.
-He wrote the book. He wrote the book. -On what?
How Rogaine doesn't work for everybody?
The book! Our course detective book!
[Miller] Greetings. I hear you need a case solved.
Colonel. Been a long time.
Francisco Perez.
Big fan.
Mr. Miller, we're also very big fans. Um, we can bring you up to speed.
So what we know already is that this is at least a two-person job.
I saw the first guy escape with Vik on a boat,
leaving the second guy still on the island.
Also, just so you know, we were both drugged last night.
I don't know if we were drugged. We did have a few drinks--
-You must be the Spitzes. -Yes.
Yes, we are!
Your reputations precede you.
-There you go. -Why, thank you.
-That's nice to hear. -Uh, not in a positive way, I'm afraid.
Okay.
I understand the last time you were involved in something like this,
everybody died?
Well, that was not the Maharajah.
How's he doing now?
-[laughs] Okay. -Right.
The Colonel's still here, most of him, so there. That's good.
Um, listen. Mr. Miller, I read your book, and--
[Miller] Colonel, I wanna see all the security footage.
All the footage was wiped from the mainframe.
Yeah, 'cause it's an inside job.
Mademoiselle Joubert,
we'll need your phone for a vocal analysis of the voice mail.
Of course. Anything you need.
They're professional, no doubt. They were concise and brief on the phone.
We also have reason to believe that the inside man was posing as an elephant handler.
You really wanna do suspects now, Mrs. Spitz?
-Sure. -[Miller] Fine.
How about this? Uh…
A husband and wife, one an NYPD almost-detective,
the other a hairdresser taking online classes.
Together they run a private detective agency teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.
And if I were to hazard a guess, I'd say it's probably taking a toll on their marriage.
Desperate to give validity to their failing business,
they accept a last-minute invite from a billionaire to attend his wedding.
And so a plan is born.
Twenty-four hours after their arrival, there's a high-profile kidnapping,
the sort that gets attention.
A career maker.
How's my reasoning, fellow… detectives?
-Pretty excellent. None of it was true. -Gorgeous.
I was starting to go with it 'cause of the way you phrase things.
-I almost believed him. -The accent helps.
Call trace is ready. Kidnappers should be calling in any minute.
If you'll excuse me, I have a job to do.
-Okay, so listen. -[Audrey] Yes, honey.
We got good cheese. We got free iPhones. I'm happy with everything.
Where are you going? Did you hear what that guy just said about us?
-[Nick] Yeah. -None of that's true!
We need to show those people what Nick and Audrey Spitz are all about.
The guy's good! I don't think he needs us.
-Nick. Audrey. -[both] What?
The kidnapper says he'll only talk to the man he shot at.
They need us. All right. They need us.
-Let's go! -Let's go!
-[machines beeping] -[Colonel] They're here.
-[Miller] He's calling back in a minute. -Okay.
You need to keep him calm, keep him talking.
-We need at least-- -Forty-five seconds.
-I know. It's not my first rodeo, pal. -You've done hostage negotiation?
I'm married to this lady. Everything's a negotiation. I got it.
I'm married to this lady. Everything's a negotiation. I got it. Appreciate it.
So 45 seconds, and it starts… now.
Hi. Kidnapper, how are you?
[kidnapper] Is this the man who tried to stop me on my escape?
Yes, yes, yes, the man you shot at.
Luckily, I got out of the way. [chuckles]
Tell me what we can do to get Vik back safely.
That's all we really care about.
[kidnapper] For the return of the Maharajah, we require $50 million.
Fifty putos millones?
Francisco, you think this is The Price Is Right, screaming out numbers?
Way too much money for just one guy.
Great. Just lost the trace. Thanks.
-It's my fault? This guy's yelling shit-- -Why are you yelling at me?
-You were directing at me-- -I yelled at that guy!
The guy's hammered right now, and I'm catching shit for it!
There's the "taking-a-toll-on-the-marriage" thing.
Excuse me! At least we are married.
Yeah. Calm down. This is how we communicate. We're from New York.
Can we remain calm?
-I'm sorry. Of course. -We're calm.
He wants the money. He's gonna call back.
-[Audrey] Relax. -[Nick] Yup.
-[phone ringing] -[Nick] Here we go. Okay.
-[Miller] Here we go. -Got this!
Forty-five seconds starts again now.
Sorry about that, man. A lot of anxious people here.
One drunk guy. We all got that friend.
[kidnapper] The price just went up to 60.
They say, "Great. No problem."
[kidnapper] You will bring $60 million in untraceable bearer bonds
to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris at 8:00 p.m. tomorrow night
and wait with this phone for further instructions.
Hello, excuse me. I'm so sorry to interrupt.
But we are going to need unequivocal evidence that the hostage is still alive.
[kidnapper] You will receive proof of life before the exchange.
-Cool. -Thank you very much.
[kidnapper] Arc de Triomphe, 8:00 p.m., or the Maharajah dies.
The voice jumbling thing you got on your… It's hard to understand you.
-The location, yes. -Can you do that again? Where is it?
-[kidnapper] Arc de Triomphe. -[Nick] This is what you sound like…
-[Nick] That's what we hear. -[kidnapper] Arc de Triomphe!
Okay, so Arctic Tree Hump.
Got it. You said that, right? [kidnapper] The price just went up to 70 now!
[kidnapper] Seventy million, or the Maharajah dies a painful death.
Muhammad Ali dies, you say?
-[kidnapper] Oh my God! -[disconnects]
You just cost us 20 extra million, you doofus!
I don't want these buffoons involved.
I'm afraid the kidnapper does, so we're stuck with them.
They did it. Got the trace.
-We did? -Aha!
-See? Team Buffoon wins again! -Thank you!
You can go back in the ocean now, Miller. We got this.
We're going to Paris. Everybody pack. Be ready to leave in one hour.
[Nick] Let's go and do some sightseeing after the ransom paying.
-Can we do that? -[Nick] Of course!
Can we just… You know what? After we get Vik back,
we could go and renew our vows at Love Locks Bridge.
It's a date.
I'm gonna need your phones.
-Need our phones? -Why?
-[Miller] They're compromised. -Oh, okay.
We'll get 'em back, right? These are brand-new. We got 'em for free.
We'll get 'em back, right? These are brand-new. We got 'em for free. In the gift bags. They gave 'em to us--
-Can't believe that happened. -We're not getting them back.
I had a dick pic on mine, but that's gone.
[Miller] Let's not obsess about phones.
The only important phone is the one the kidnapper will call on. Here.
I set it up so we can hear everything. I'm gonna need one of you to be armed.
-Mr. Spitz, can you handle a gun? -[Nick] Yes.
-I told you, I was on the force. What? -Um…
[hesitates] I just think maybe I should handle it.
-You should handle it? -Just--
-Why would that-- -Your aim is--
My aim? My aim is fine.
-Why are you saying this? -He can't hear--
That's like me saying you wear Spanx in front of a supermodel.
So, uh, I'll take the gun 'cause I'm very good with a gun.
They used to call me "Nicky Guns" on the force. That was my nickname.
Gang members used to ask me for advice on the weekends 'cause I shot so well.
I'd say, "I can't. I don't wanna help you guys."
You take the gun.
I'll take the gun. I got the phone, and you got the money.
When they call, I want you to follow the three rules of ransom drops
When they call, I want you to follow the three rules of ransom drops from Chapter 12 of my book.
Can you do that? Remember what they are?
Number one. Um, follow all reasonable instructions.
-Yes. -[Audrey] Number two.
Do not hand off the ransom until you see the kidnappee.
[Miller] Exactly. And number three. Do not go to a secondary location with them.
And number three. Do not go to a secondary location with them.
Perfect. You'll be fine. Off you go.
-Okay. -"Nicky Guns" style. Let's go!
-Cool. -I'm gonna hand you this.
You gotta tell me who on earth ever called you "Nicky Guns."
You gotta tell me who didn't call me that. Everybody called me that.
This is the heaviest goddamn case of money I've ever felt.
Why couldn't they Venmo? This thing weighs…
My hands are killing me.
I'm gonna go two hands. Does that look weird?
-[Audrey] Your hands are cute. -[Nick] "Cute"? What does that mean?
-You have cute hands. -Your family has orangutan ha--
You grew up thinking giant hands are normal.
[Audrey] I never said dainty hands.
I said it's weird to high-five you 'cause your hands are little.
[Nick] They're average hands.
-Your grandmother can palm a bulldog. -[Audrey] Oh, please.
Shit, shit, shit. That's the phone.
Okay, here we go.
Initiate the trace.
Hi. Bonjour, uh, madame or mademoiselle or monsieur. Go ahead.
[Vik] Nick, it's me!
[Nick] Rajah! You okay?
So we got the money, and we just need to know where to bring it.
So tell us, and we'll get you out of there.
-[Vik yelps] -What happened?
[kidnapper] You have your proof of life. Now take the money to the van at the curb.
Okay.
-Wh-- Wh-- What van? -Van?
What van are we talking about? That van there?
[kidnapper] Don't point, you idiot! Just casually walk in that direction.
Okay. Okay. I'm coming.
[kidnapper] Anything out of the ordinary, and the Maharajah dies.
Don't do that. Okay, we're coming.
We gotta go to the van.
-That van? -No! Don't point.
He doesn't like pointing. That van.
Oh shit.
Get in the van.
We'll give you the money in exchange for the Maharajah.
He's not far.
Get in the van.
-Don't get in the van! -[Claudette speaking French]
-That wasn't part of the deal. -Number three. Don't get in the van.
Get in the van, or I'll shoot you both in the stomach,
take you to the countryside, and feed you to the swine.
-Okay. Let's get in the van. -Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, sorry. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Stupid Americans.
-Give us the money! -Give you the money.
-All right. You got it. -Just give him the money!
-One second. -I do have these too.
What the fuck?
I brought these for us in case we wanted to celebrate after,
but I'm gonna change the plans.
So what I'll do is put this on here, and I'll put this on here.
This goes wherever we go now.
You understand? I don't know where the--
-No! -What happened? -What happened? -Hello?
We're offline?
Stand by.
Take us to the Maharajah now. What do you think of that?
Chop off his hand.
-Chop off my hand? -What?
-[kidnapper] Yes! -No! Hatchet!
-Find the key. -I do know where the key is.
-Look in here. -No, no, no. Shoot.
-Shoot, I can't find it. -Check your other pockets!
Son of a gun! I can't seem to pull the trigger on finding the key.
Son of a gun! I can't seem to pull the trigger on finding the key. -[Audrey] What are you talking about? -Your gun! Shoot this asshole!
-[Audrey] What are you talking about? -Your gun! Shoot this asshole!
Oh my God!
[Audrey] Oh my God! Oh my God, I'm so sorry!
Don't apologize, honey. You killed the kidnapper!
Oh my God!
Shoot this guy!
Can I shoot him in the leg? I don't wanna kill anybody else!
What is the difference? You're already a murderer!
I don't wanna be a mass murderer!
-[Nick] Grab the hatchet! -[Audrey] Okay!
What?
Oh my God!
Sweetheart, you're not just a mass murderer.
You're an axe murderer!
[Audrey] Honey, he's moving. Oh my God.
[Audrey] Honey, he's moving. Oh my God. I think he might be… He might be okay.
[groans] Those are death twitches, honey!
[Audrey] Jesus!
[Audrey] His foot's on the gas!
-Grab the wheel! -Oh God!
Oh shit! It's so gross! I touched… I touched it!
[Nick] Oh yeah! Who's gonna feed who to the swine now, huh?
That's the dead guy, Nick!
[Audrey] People, move!
Oh shit!
[Nick] Are you literally hitting everything?
-[Nick] Door's open! -Oh my God! What did you do?
Oh God! Honey!
Oh my God!
Honey, pole!
-What? -There's a pole!
I can't hear you!
Oh my God.
Never mind.
[panting] Okay, baby.
-Bonjour. -Bonjour. Are you all okay?
-[Nick] Sorry. Let me get down. -[Audrey] Careful. Oh my goodness!
-Ow! Jesus! -[Nick] Everybody okay there?
-Oh my God. -Hi. Hi. How was lunch?
-What? -What?
-What? -What?
[Nick] Oh no.
-[Audrey] Wait. What? No! -[Nick] What the--
I didn't take a cheese knife. I took the cheese!
Why did you grab it? Why did you have cheese?
I had cheese because I had the hookah munchies, and it was good cheese.
That knife never left the room, Nick.
But it did leave the room. Maybe they stole the knife so they could deepfake us.
-Our fingerprints are all over it! -C'est caca!
-We did not do this. -[French accent] Television say bullshit!
-We're not capable of doing anything… -Nous sommes innocents! -Innocents! -…like this.
Like, uh, opposite of O.J.!
[Audrey] We would never do this. -I swear! I promise you! -No.
-I swear! I promise you! -No.
-[Audrey sighs] -Hey! Oh God!
I told you not to get in the van.
-We-- -The guy had a gun!
-What do you mean? You had a gun! -[Nick] Yeah--
-I used the gun! -She used it good!
Do you see what they're doing to us on the TV?
-That's been digitally altered. -[Nick] Yes!
-I knew you'd see through that. -Thank you for noticing. That's a pro.
Is the case intact?
[laughing] Well! We did that! -That was nice! -How did they find us so fast?
-That was nice! -How did they find us so fast?
They've got 70 million reasons.
-Ah! -Give me the case. Do you have the key?
The key? For what? These are sex handcuffs.
Look. All I gotta do is this.
Okay. When they see me with this, they'll follow me.
-[Nick] Right. -Nothing I can't handle.
I see that.
Meet at the Madeleine, 1900 hours.
No problem. Yeah, we'll be there.
I was harsh about your business before.
We may not be equals, but we do share a passion.
I see that now. Hurrah!
Hey, I was wrong. That guy is a stud.
Honey…
What if Miller's the kidnapper?
[Nick] He said he's gonna meet us at 1900 hours at the Madeleine.
I know, but bad people, they lie.
All right? And we just handed the guy $70 million.
-Oh God. Maybe you're right. -I'm just saying.
Nope, you were wrong.
-Who's this? -I don't know. Where'd he come from?
-[Nick] He's gonna walk into the flames? -He walked right into that.
He's got the case!
-No! Oh my God! -Now I'm very confused!
-[Audrey] Oh no. Who's that guy? -[Nick] This guy?
Oh my God!
[Audrey whispering] N-E-4-1-3-D-A-N.
We're Europe's most wanted again. We better run!
-I'm gonna grab… Okay. -Grab that hat.
-What is… Um… -[Nick] What is this?
-[Delacroix speaking French] -[Nick] It's Delacroix! That guy loves us.
-I understood "opera." Okay. Go, go, go! -Okay. Okay.
-[gasps] How? -[Audrey] Surprise! Audrey and Nick!
-Smoke rings! How you doing? -Hi! Did you get our Christmas card?
I'm fine, and yes. The matching sweaters were a nice touch.
-[laughs softly] -That was my idea.
So, hey, we need a little bit of help.
-We need a lot of help. -[Nick] Yeah.
-You are under arrest. -[Nick] No!
I can never tell when you're being serious.
He looks serious. Are you serious?
For kidnapping the Maharajah,
murdering his bodyguard,
stealing $70 million,
destroying many city blocks,
and, I'm assuming, sneaking into the opera.
-We didn't do all of that. -We did number four and number six.
We're just… We're being framed.
[Nick] We got a hunch who really did it.
We need you to track this license plate for us.
Nothing would give me greater pleasure,
but then I would have to immediately report such help to my superiors,
or I would be guilty of aiding and abetting.
How's this? We can tie you up,
and then you can say we forced you into helping us.
Wait, wait. Who are you calling?
I'm not calling anyone.
I have an app to track the vehicle with that plate.
They have an app for that? -[Delacroix] Mm-hmm. -Tsk!
God. You got Shazam on that after?
I just… I wanna know what song this is.
[Nick] So the app says the truck is parked out by a château that's 80 kilometers away?
[Delacroix] Mm-hmm. Excuse me.
[Delacroix] Mm-hmm. Excuse me. Can you scratch my nose?
Uh… Uh, softer. Softer. Hmm. [moaning]
-Thank you. -Also, do you have a car we can borrow?
-The keys are in my pants pocket. -[Audrey] Okay.
You talking to Audrey on that one too? I'll handle the pants pocket.
What can I say? [chuckles] Shooters gotta shoot.
Okay, is this a potato or a key 'cause I'm… Okay, got it.
-[Audrey] We'll take care of it. -Hey, hey.
Okay, no food in my car.
[Nick] Man, I bet Delacroix's got a sick-ass vehicle.
[Colonel] Excuse me.
Bonsoir, Inspector.
-Bonsoir, Colonel! -Enchanté!
The police are looking for you.
Yeah, no kidding. Colonel, we did not do this.
[Colonel] I know that, but they have your fingerprints all over the murder weapon
and footage of you running out of the tent with it.
-[Nick] Yeah. -Typical Spitz vacation insanity.
Miller's dead, by the way, and we lost the money.
It just looks like you took it.
It gets worse! The kidnappers just called. They've given us
It gets worse! The kidnappers just called. They've given us a midnight deadline to come up with the money,
or they will kill the Maharajah.
Okay, Colonel, will you just stall for us until then?
-[Nick] Merci beaucoup! -[Audrey] Thank you, Colonel!
Oh my God!
Well, now you know why the kidnapper needs $70 million.
For the heating bill.
Oh boy.
Okay, so that moat's, like, three meters?
I think I can clear that.
Nick, three meters is, like, ten feet.
I had the high school record for the long jump.
And I'm not kidding. I went further than that back in the day.
-Hmm. Did you? -Yeah.
What'd they call you back then? "Nicky Long Legs"?
You're mocking me?
[Audrey] You're not gonna make that jump.
It doesn't make me feel good to prove you wrong, but I'm gonna.
-All right? -[Audrey] Mm-hmm.
Okay, from that angle, it does look further than three meters.
-Oh shoot. -What do you think? -Do you think maybe you could do it? -Now you want me to make that jump?
-Do you think maybe you could do it? -Now you want me to make that jump?
Bonsoir.
[both] Countess?
Surprised?
[both] Yeah. -Did you hear we just said… -[both] "Countess?"
Oh God.
Where's Vik?
I guess the kidnappers have him.
Kid… You're not the kidnappers?
No, no, no. I would never do such a thing. Vikram is my friend.
[scoffs] Your friend.
You loved him.
[coughing] Oh God!
-I love money. -Hmm, hmm, hmm.
When I heard you two amateurs are gonna be handling so much of it,
I just had to have it.
"Had to have it." [giggles]
-So you didn't plant that knife? -Or deepfake that footage?
Or slip something into our drinks that night at the villa?
-Why bring that up? It's not relevant. -[Audrey] Of course that is relevant!
-It's extremely relev-- -All right! All right! Jesus!
-God! -[Nick] Yo. Two bad guys never works out.
-One always double-crosses the other. -[Audrey] It's a cliché of the genre.
-We've seen this before. Trust us. -So many times.
-We've seen this before. Trust us. -So many times. -Save yourself. -Please.
Imani? Is the car ready for our getaway?
-Yes, Countess. -[Countess] Brilliant.
-No! -No! Don't!
-[Audrey] Oh my God. -I couldn't have been more clear.
[Audrey] That is the cliché. -Yeah. -Right there.
With any luck, the smoke will get to you before the flames do.
-[both gasp] -No!
Oops.
[Audrey] What?
Triple cross.
Oh my God. We are so getting blamed for both those assholes being dead.
[Nick] Let's go! -We gotta hop out of here! -Okay!
-Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Together! -[Audrey yelps]
-Oh my God! -Go, go, go! Back, back, back!
To the window! To the window! Go, go! Back, back, back!
-[Audrey] Oh shit! -[groans]
-[Audrey] Jesus! -Are you okay?
-[Audrey] Are you okay? -[Nick] You gotta roll away.
-[Audrey groans] -No! That way!
Oh my God, you're so big!
That's what you said on our honeymoon, but like then, we gotta keep trying.
Oh my God, honey! I don't even know where we're rolling to, honey!
-[Nick] I don't know! -[Audrey] Oh my God!
I was the one who roofied us.
Wha-- What?
I mean, you did it, but it was because of me.
I keep my Ambien in the Advil bottle that you use, and I…
I just get so stressed out. I'm sorry. It was all me.
Don't apologize. I'm the one who needs to apologize.
I have been criticizing you so much. I feel terrible.
-I'm sorry. -No. It doesn't matter.
Your billboards and dental floss business cards--
-Dental floss business cards. -[Audrey] I know, and I didn't think…
-It's not that it was a bad idea-- -The razor thing on the card!
I can use it to cut the tape! I got one in my pocket!
-Where? -Right here in the back pocket.
[Audrey] Oh! Hold on. Hold on! Hold on! I'm trying to find it.
[Nick] Help me. Help me. Get it. Get it. Get it. Reach.
-Reach down. Down. Please, God. -[Audrey] Got it. I got it!
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Are we good? Are we cutting this?
-Is it working? -I think it's working.
[Audrey] Oh my God! I love you, dental floss business cards.
I love you so much. Oh, please, please, please. Yes! Yes!
Yes! Get the feet.
-I got it! -[Nick] Come on! Come on! Go! Go!
[Audrey] Oh no!
-What are you doing? -[Nick] Oh God.
Here, take this. I'm gonna shoot out the window.
God!
My God! It's a French gun!
[Audrey] Honey!
-No. -What?
No!
Baby! Oh! I love you!
Oh God.
-What? -No! -No, no! No, no, no! -No, no, no, no, no!
Shit! Shit!
Nick.
This time, I'm driving.
Okay.
Are you kidding me? [laughs] I can't… You're getting it again, hon.
-Sorry. -That's all right.
[Delacroix] Mesdames et messieurs…
My name is Inspector Laurent Delacroix.
Fifteen minutes ago, Interpol assumed operational control of this matter
and assigned me to head the task force.
Okay, we get it, but why all of a sudden Interpol gets involved?
The heinous nature of the crimes.
Several murders, a kidnapping, the destruction of the oldest café in Paris,
the tying up of a very handsome opera fan.
Oh dear God.
Okay, but why should we believe you'll be able to find Nick and Audrey Spitz?
Because I have them on the phone.
-[Audrey] Hello? Hey. Is everybody there? -Yes, Audrey.
Everyone except--
The Countess and her creepy little friend?
Give back Vikram, you monsters!
-You already got the money. -Yes, we do have the money.
And if you ever wanna see it again, you better tell the kidnapper
And if you ever wanna see it again, you better tell the kidnapper to bring the Maharajah to the Jules Verne restaurant.
What? The what?
[Audrey] Jules Verne restaurant.
Jules Verne restaurant? Ah, Le Ju-- -Le Jules Verne. -Oh.
On the observation deck at the Eiffel Tower at midnight.
[Nick] Yes.
What do you mean? We don't have my brother.
-Bullshit! -Oh, somebody there does, okay?
So do what my wife just said. Midnight, Maharajah, alive.
And, Inspector, we tried to start your car up
And, Inspector, we tried to start your car up but, uh, couldn't get it done, so we left it there.
What?
We stole a Lamborghini. You can have that when we're done with it.
Okay.
Oh my God. So gorgeous.
Why are you all dressed up?
We read online there was a dress code.
We couldn't get into Tavern on the Green 'cause I was wearing shorts one time.
-Wh-- Where is everybody? -Yeah.
We bought out the restaurant so we wouldn't be disturbed.
You do understand the idea of doing this in public is so there are actually people around?
-How did you even get these clothes? -And you got your hair done?
Look, we had a situation, all right?
There was a moat, and then we did… I don't have to explain myself, okay?
We'll be the ones who ask the questions. How's that?
-Go ahead. Ask the questions. -Let's review the suspects, shall we?
Get comfortable.
Let's start with Saira Govindan.
Me?
I defended you. I actually really liked you.
I know you did. We really liked you. You've been so nice to us.
It's just kind of what we do.
Kidnap my own brother?
-She's getting upset. -I see. She's in front of me.
Are you out of your mind?
-Just move on. Audrey, move on. -Moving on.
[Nick] All good, Saira.
[Audrey] Francisco, chairman of the board.
With the Maharajah gone, you can embezzle all the money you want
to cover all those paternity suits for your 2,000 children.
I say we make it 2,001, huh?
Get out of my face.
Disgusting pig.
Claudette Joubert.
Joubert.
Parisian shopgirl desperate for money.
If I wanted money, don't you think I'd just marry him?
Not with that brutal prenup the board had you sign.
But what about the Colonel? What's his motive?
Well, maybe he just is sick of working for rich people 'cause you guys suck.
Or maybe the Colonel needed enough money to afford himself
Or maybe the Colonel needed enough money to afford himself a bionic arm.
I looked into it. They're not very expensive.
-How much are we talking? -Twenty, thirty K.
That's it? Jeez, maybe I should get something like that.
You're gonna have to lose an arm for that.
I wasn't talking about for the arm.
Okay, we went through everybody.
Who did it?
-[all laughing] -Mon amour!
Um, I've been asked to show you all this sick-ass bomb and shit.
Oh my God.
Enough to blow this whole damn tower up, G.
So check it. You gotta put the Benjamins in the lift and send it to the top floor.
Once the amount has been chickity-checked, they'll send down the, uh…
God, what's it called? The button blaster thingy? The--
-The remote detonator? -Yes, that shit.
They'll send that back down, and then we can be outtie.
And it's a bit of a hurry or something because, you know…
-[all] Oh no! -[Audrey] Oh my God, Nick!
Nick, Nick, Nick. The money. You must put it in the elevator.
-Now! -Nah.
-"Nah"? -What do you mean, "nah"?
-What are you doing? -I don't think they'll blow him up.
Nick, are you really just going on a hunch right now?
-Trust me. -[Vik] Nick!
Bro-heem!
No, it's all good in the hood, Maharajah.
Whoever did this had some serious training, right?
'Cause he killed Mr. Lou, a lethal badass.
We're counting down here, G.
No, no. Nick, Nick, Nick!
And we know the kidnapper had some major hacking skills
to access that footage and do the deepfake.
Come on, Nick!
He knew exactly where to find Mr. Lou and Vik backstage at the wedding
in order to pull off the elephant switcheroo.
-But, honey-- -Nick! I'm gonna blow up!
With all that expertise…
-God, Nick! -[rapid beeping]
…this guy should write a book.
-Oh my God, Nick! -[all clamoring]
[sighs] "Thousands of studies have shown that the kidnapper will do nothing
[sighs] "Thousands of studies have shown that the kidnapper will do nothing to jeopardize the receiving of the ransom."
Chapter 9, section 3, written by Mr. Connor Miller.
You read the book.
From cover to cover, sweetheart, and it sucked.
You gotta try this. It's so good.
You just scared the crap out of me.
[Audrey] What was that?
What?
Very impressive.
How did you get out of that SUV before it blew up?
I didn't.
I climbed into a bomb-proof titanium chamber in the back seat.
A public death. What better way to eliminate himself as a suspect.
Yeah, yeah. But everything didn't go according to your plan, did it?
[Audrey] Your guy had his hand on the case seconds before a clean getaway.
[Nick] And boom.
The greedy ex enters the chat.
Hmm. $70 million. That's a lot of money,
Hmm. $70 million. That's a lot of money, even for a countess.
So she sends Imani over to hijack the hijackers.
-Who? -[both] Imani.
-[Colonel] Who? -Iman-- The sidekick to the--
The Countess's… You know, do the laugh.
Do I have to? -Just knock it out. -[imitates Imani]
Now they know.
And then she swoops in,
steals the ransom money right out from under your nose.
-That must have hurt. -Uh-huh.
Now, if you had, in fact, read my book properly,
you'd remember that revealing the identity of a heretofore anonymous criminal
puts all those privy to that information at risk.
Which means
I'm gonna have to kill you all.
-[all clamoring] -Oh God! [sobs]
Gary?
Who the hell are you?
I'm Susan.
-Do you know who this is? -I have no idea.
Gary and I met here ten years ago when I was studying abroad,
and we promised that if we still loved each other
and we hadn't found anyone else,
that we would meet halfway up the Eiffel Tower at midnight tonight.
And I still love him very much.
Are any of you Gary?
Put your hand down, Francisco.
-[Audrey] Oh my God! -[all yelling]
Whoa!
Oh God!
Get ready.
It just remains for me to say, it's been a pleasure.
He still has the button blaster thingy!
-Audrey! -[Audrey yelling]
Oh my God!
No! This is not what I planned!
There really is no end to your bad decision-making, is there?
Nick! I can't believe I'm doing this.
Take my gun. [groans]
Wait! You need bullets. In my pocket.
Oh, you little rascal.
-You got it in there deep, huh? -You got it.
[Nick] Susan, put some pressure on the inspector's wound.
Is this like an interactive theater thing?
I'm glad my biggest fan is gonna get to see this.
Actually, not as much of a fan as I used to be.
That's a shame because I'm about to teach my final lesson…
How to blow up the Eiffel Tower and get away with it.
You would never do that.
There's only one thing I hate more than witnesses,
and that's the French.
That door opens, everyone inside is dead, understand?
-[elevator bell dings] -[Audrey] Nick! No, Nick! No, no! No, no, no!
Nick! Oh!
[Claudette] It's stuck.
-Get this shit off me. I feel vulnerable! -The vest is a medium.
You haven't been a medium since you were 14!
Just chill out, please! Get this vest off me.
You all right?
[breathless] I need my vape.
-Okay. -[Delacroix] In my pocket there.
The right pocket.
-This? -No, no. Oh, no. That's your penis.
-You got it. -[Susan] Okay, got it. Got it.
I don't think this is the best thing for someone who's been shot,
but go for it.
Here comes Brooklyn.
-It stopped! -Oh!
Oh God!
Cut that damn thing off!
Step back, or this money goes.
I don't believe you.
How the hell do you do that without getting a concussion?
God's gift!
He will never blink again.
-[Audrey] Nick! -Yeah, we're coming, precious!
Let me handle this, please.
Perhaps… a mild concussion.
-Get the thing off! -We are all gonna blow up!
I don't know what to do!
[Nick] It's all good, babe!
Nicky Two Guns in the house!
Did I hit anything?
You got the detonator thingy, honey!
Okay, good! That's what I was aiming for!
Oh, my love.
The ring. The rings of love.
Yes. Okay. We're gonna use the guns for something else now, aren't we, bro?
Smacked up your friends pretty good. You're next.
What's up? What's up?
Okay.
Where you going? Babe!
Where you going? Babe! Audrey!
Honey!
It's okay, baby! I got you! Just hang on!
I must have missed the chapter on face-kicking.
[Audrey] Oh my gosh.
[grunts] Come here.
It's time to make it rain, bitch.
[yelling] No!
Come to me!
Finish off the others.
Oh… Okay.
-[Delacroix] What is that? -That really killed the vibe.
[Audrey] Hey, Miller!
My husband was right. Your book sucked.
She never misses.
I'm so sorry!
-Now you miss? -I'm sorry, baby! I'm sorry!
[screaming] Oh shit!
Goddamn! Are you aiming for me or him?
Him, I promise! I promise!
-Just shoot him. Shoot him! -Shit!
-Okay. -[Nick] Shoot him!
Uh, I've come to the end of my rope, you know what I mean?
My wheels are really turning right now. They're spinnin', my wheels.
Oh God. Okay.
Never misses, huh?
Not everybody can be as good as you, I guess.
Enjoy the ride, Miller.
Oh my God.
-[Susan shrieks] -Get down!
-[screams] -[exclaims] -Oh! -Jeez!
Paris is very weird.
He's dead this time.
-He's so dead. -He is. It's done.
How did you come up with that plan? How do you do that?
-I have no idea-- -You're a genius.
It just kinda came out. Like, I just was like, what? My baby!
You are next-level! I would never think of anything that good.
Thank you. I don't know what I did, and it was so scary.
-What? -We're a team now, hmm?
-No. No. Get him off. Get him off. -Don't touch her. It's getting her upset.
-No. No. Get him off. Get him off. -Don't touch her. It's getting her upset. -Back up. -Just back up.
You did good, but just back up. Give us room. Thank you.
-Oh, babe. -It's all right. I love you, baby.
That was just… It's kind of a beautiful Paris night besides that.
Yeah.
Yes. Hey!
-[Colonel] Nick! Audrey! -Hey! You guys did it again! Oh!
-Vik, I am so sorry about the money. -Yes, we apologize. It was a lot of money to throw away.
I think Paris is gonna thank you from the bottom of their hearts.
Don't worry about it. Just as long as none of my peeps got murked, yeah?
[laughs] Apart from Mr. Lou.
Oh, yeah, that's true.
-[laughs] -Lou who, huh? [laughs]
Oh no. What happened to you? Why are you bleeding?
Oh, no. It's… I'm not. It's henna.
It must have smeared in tonight's commotion.
Oh, thank God. I'm sick. I can't take one more accident tonight.
No more blood, please. -I swear, I thought it was blood. -I am exhausted. Aren't you?
-I swear, I thought it was blood. -I am exhausted. Aren't you?
[Vik] Yeah.
-What are you muttering about right now? -Something doesn't make sense.
I'm sorry. It just doesn't make any sense.
Saira, I'm so sorry. What…
Did you just say you smeared your henna during tonight's commotion?
That's right.
That's interesting.
[scoffs] Why is that interesting?
[Nick] Yes, why is that interesting?
You know, I never saw you during the welcome dance.
And then you just kind of showed up right after the elephant arrived.
Yeah. I was… I was getting a drink. [laughs]
Honey, I was a hairdresser, and I know a thing or two about dyes,
and once henna sets, it doesn't smear.
Sorry. I… I have no idea what you're talking about.
That wasn't blood that I saw on the elephant handler's robe.
It was henna.
And it was your henna that never had time to dry the night of the murder.
Oh my God! The sister did it!
Oh snap!
Come on. This is lunacy! You guys, haven't we done this already?
I love my brother. I mean, what reason would I have to--
Maybe because your parents gave him the family business,
even though you're the smart one,
and he's the Jet Skiing rapper wannabe with no skill at all?
No offense.
Some taken.
And isn't that the same reason you tried to kill him in Mumbai?
You!
Well, my parents were right about one thing.
If you need something done correctly, you should just do it yourself.
-[Vik] Saira! -[Audrey gasps]
[Colonel] No!
Oh! This poor guy, honey! He's running out of arms!
Not in my town.
Yeah! That's my bae!
[sighs] Thank you, baby. I've got to just…
-'Sup! It's okay. Yeah. -[Colonel groans]
You… You did great, pal. You're my number one bodyguard.
And not just 'cause the last one got smoked.
That Kwanzaa bonus better be off the hook this year.
Hey, it's bionic arm time, bitch! Yeah?
-Yeah? -Yeah!
[Susan] You're okay.
-How are you feeling, young man? -How are you doing?
-I'm okay. -Laurent is a special man. Aren't you?
We're gonna go to dinner once you get out of the hospital. Ah!
Paris weaves its spell once again.
Feel better.
-All right. -[Vik] Should we tell them?
-All right. -[Vik] Should we tell them? -Yes! [laughs] -Okay, guys. We decided to elope.
-Yes! [laughs] -Okay, guys. We decided to elope.
-That is the smart choice, always. -That's amazing.
Good for you guys.
Yeah, no family, but, um,
Yeah, no family, but, um, I owe you guys my life.
Oh, we're just happy you're both okay.
And really, honestly, thank you for giving us an adventure…
Yes.
…we are never going to forget.
-Oh. -Yep. -I guess we're even then. Peace out. -Peace out!
-I guess we're even then. Peace out. -Peace out!
-Bye-bye. -Au revoir!
Sorry about your sister being a psycho, by the way.
Ah, don't worry about it. She's a real piece of shit.
-Yes, she was. -[both] Yeah.
-[Nick] Okay. -Honey, I'm really ready to go home.
-Yes, I am too. -I'm really ready.
We have to do one thing first.
-Trust me. Trust me. All right? -What? Okay. Okay. Okay.
-[Nick] Check on the Colonel. You okay? -[Audrey] Colonel!
You're not losing this arm?
[Nick] Click it. Click it. We did it.
Now we are forever locked up together for the rest of our lives.
I'd never wanna be locked up with anybody else.
Me neither, sweetheart. You are--
-[man] The Shitz! -What?
[chuckles] Nick and Audrey Shitz!
-The helicopter guy? What the-- -What are you doing here?
Take it. Take the phone!
Hello?
[Vik] Of course we're not even. Take my helicopter! Go anywhere! Have a honeymoon you deserve! And a little cash!
Go anywhere! Have a honeymoon you deserve! And a little cash!
-What? -Cash? A bag of--
-Are you for real? -[Nick laughs] -Oh my gosh. Look! Oh my-- -Well, yeah.
-Oh my gosh. Look! Oh my-- -Well, yeah. That seems to be enough money. Thank you.
[Vik] Just ten million! Don't spend it all in one place!
But if you do spend it all, just sell the briefcase.
It's worth three million!
-It's dinosaur leather! -My God!
Dinosaur? We can't take this! Come on!
You know what? We will take this. Thank you.
[Vik] Now you two keep busting nuts! Maharajah out!
What's the first thing you wanna do? -I wanna kiss you! -Ah!
I can't believe this!
-My baby. -My darling.
The honeymoon we always deserved.
-Exactly. -Finally.
-Exactly. -Finally. [both] Mm-hmm.
Can you believe how lucky we are?
[American accent] You liking those drinks?
-What-- -Are you shitz-ing us right now?
Hand me the bag.
What? The, uh--
-Bag. Hand me the bag. -You want this?
-That's not a problem. -Give him the bag.
[Nick] What happened to the accent?
It's back in Jersey.
Let's just have a civilized conversation.
isn't because it kills at a high frequency.
It isn't because it's communicable, like COVID's communicable,
you get that from your neighbor.
It's because it has a spore.
The spore form can exist for decades.
You can't get rid of it.
Once those spores get inside the body, then, of course, they germinate and take over
and will kill an animal.
The spores, then, get back into the soil.
It has to kill in order to survive.
It has to kill to complete its life cycle.
[reporter 1] At the American Media Incorporated building in Boca Raton.
The building has been sealed and anthrax has now been detected
on a computer keyboard used by 63-year-old Bob Stevens.
He's the first person in the U.S.
to die of the extremely rare form of the disease in 25 years.
[reporter 2] Investigators believe he contracted this anthrax naturally,
which means it must have come from soil or from a farm animal.
[reporter 3] Do we know…? Sir, was this inhalation anthrax?
Was this fellow a hunter?
It appears, at this point in time, it's inhalation.
[reporter 3] Do we know if he was a hunter?
We don't-- We don't know. We know he was an outdoorsman.
[reporter 4] Mister Secretary, any reason to believe this is a result of terrorism?
It appears that this is just an isolated case.
There's no evidence of terrorism.
[man 2] Soon after 9/11, I get a phone call from a FBI scientist,
and he starts to tell me about this unusual case of anthrax.
They were reporting that he had pulmonary,
or inhalational anthrax.
And so they did a spinal tap.
The bacterium bacillus anthracis.
It spread everywhere, even into his central nervous system.
Anthrax would not be a good death.
You'd spike a high fever, you'd feel very terrible, and then you'd crash and die.
In Palm Beach County, Florida,
dozens of anxious office workers were screened for signs of bacteria today.
[woman 1] Didn't sleep very well.
They told me to get my son 'cause he's been in the building.
When you don't really have a direction,
then you have to look at every direction.
We didn't know what we had.
We had someone who had died
from anthrax poisoning.
The question is, how did it get there?
[Paul] So the FBI said, "We want to send you a sample so that you can analyze the DNA."
We were expected to perform, and we needed to do this fast.
[reporter 5] President Bush told Americans there's progress
in the search for those believed to be responsible
for the September terrorist attacks.
[George W. Bush] My focus is bringing Al-Qaeda to justice.
[reporter 6] Mr. Bush urged Americans to go about their lives.
To fly on airplanes, to go to work.
But he also said they should use common sense
and report things that seem suspicious.
Good morning, I'm Andy Lack. I'm with NBC.
I'm here with the Mayor.
This morning, we received a positive test for cutaneous anthrax
for one of our colleagues who works on Nightly News.
[newscaster 1] A floor of the NBC television network headquarters, closed down.
Authorities determining if any other traces
of the anthrax bacteria are present.
[woman 2] They said that somebody in the building had anthrax.
That was frightening.
You know, you could die from it. Right?
[security guard] Excuse me, please.
[Rudy Giuliani] At NBC, there's one other person who handled the letter
who is now confirmed to have developed cutaneous anthrax.
[policeman] Get him out of here. Get him out of here.
-[horn honks] -Come on, let's go!
In this huge stack of mail, I saw this letter.
[woman 3] When I open the letter, I got chills all over. So…
It said, "9/11/01."
"Death to America. Death to Israel."
"Allah is great."
And inside was
what appeared to be, to me, it looked like a combination of brown sugar and sand.
I took the substance and I dumped it into the trash.
I just was incredibly sick. I felt like there was something running through my whole body and my veins.
I felt like there was something running through my whole body and my veins.
My doctors gave me an antibiotic.
I could have died easily if I had just one misstep,
or if I decided I was going to smell that,
you know, the anthrax, I would have been dead.
[Casey] We had a car waiting downstairs to take us to the FBI.
You know, we're whisked away in a black car.
I remember I looked over at the ticker by the Today Show
and it was like, "Anthrax at NBC,"
and I thought, "Oh, my God, this is crazy."
[Brad] The big fear was this is the second wave of a terrorist attack,
and now we've got an Islamic terrorist group that's sending out poison to people.
It just feels so vulnerable now because you don't know what's gonna happen,
It just feels so vulnerable now because you don't know what's gonna happen, where it's gonna happen.
[Brad] The real concern at that point is, are there more of these?
This comes to us from Washington, D.C.
President Bush just announced, uh, from the Rose Garden
that, uh, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle,
um, has reported seeing a suspicious letter, and that the authorities believe that letter contains anthrax.
and that the authorities believe that letter contains anthrax.
I did contact each of the other members of leadership.
If it happened in my office,
it could happen elsewhere.
[reporter 7] Law enforcement officials say they now have reason to believe
that there may be a connection between the Daschle case in Washington,
the NBC News case in New York,
and the tabloid newspaper case in Florida.
[George W. Bush] I will answer a couple of questions.
The anthrax attacks, sir, do you believe there is any connection
to Bin Laden's organization?
Well, there may be some possible link.
He and his spokesman are openly bragging about how they hope to inflict
more pain on our country.
I wouldn't put it past him but we don't have hard evidence yet. Yeah, Ron.
[newscaster 1] The seven-month-old son of an ABC News employee…
[newscaster 2] …a worker at the New York Post was diagnosed…
[newscaster 3] An assistant to CBS News anchor, Dan Rather, exposed as well.
Do you know how much mail, how many packages I've opened?
I don't want to touch the mail.
It's a new form of human warfare.
Kathy Nguyen did die due to inhalation anthrax.
This time it's a woman in Connecticut.
[reporter 8] …provided more questions than answers.
Until there is a suspect, no one will know whether this was a terrorist act
and whether it is related to the September 11 terrorists
who tried to rent a crop dusting aircraft.
[newscaster 4] If we're really being honest,
if America is prepared for a chemical attack,
the answer is no.
Oh, my god!
Maybe we shouldn't be talking here.
Maybe there's anthrax flying around in the air.
[reporter 9] Pharmacy supplies of the antibiotic Cipro,
one of the drugs known to fight anthrax, are thin.
[reporter 10] Gas masks sell out in Los Angeles.
It's probably a little paranoia, but I'm not gonna take the chance. That's all.
We face an enemy as ruthless and unpredictable as any we've ever faced.
[reporter 11] And the road back to a sense of security could be a long one.
I feel like I go to work, I don't know what's going to happen next.
[Brad] The mail system touches the entire United States.
And so the potential of these letters going to whomever was huge.
How in the world are we gonna get our arms around this quickly?
One of America's most distinguished scientists, Dr. Paul Keim.
[Paul] Early in the investigation, I thought it was a foreign source
associated with Al-Qaeda and the 9/11 attacks,
but we got the data and we started comparing it to our databases.
And it matched up with this strain that we call the Ames strain.
Everybody was silent
because at that point, the only examples of the Ames strain,
even to this day, the only examples of the Ames strain that we have in our database
originate in American laboratories.
The person that we were pursuing was one of us.
[reporter] Barbara Hatch Rosenberg believes the anthrax attack is an inside job.
What many consider to be the largest FBI investigation in history.
This is criminal intent to commit murder.
[man] We will find the perpetrators of anthrax
and we will punish the guilty for their crimes.
Hi.
[crew member] Final touches.
[crew member] Sound check, please.
One, two, one, two. Testing. One, two, three, four.
Okay.
My name is Dr. Bruce Edward Ivins.
I am a Department of Defense researcher at USAMRIID.
That's the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.
[Bruce] For me, it's a real thrill to make a discovery
and know that I've just revealed something
that no one else in the world ever knew before. [man 1] Morning, sir.
[Bruce] I feel like a detective
and that which is unknown
dares me to try to find out about it.
[man 2] Bruce Ivins, he struck me as somewhat eccentric,
but he had a worldwide reputation as one of the experts on anthrax.
He was extremely well thought of.
As opposed to being aloof and self-important,
-Bruce was neither of those things. -[woman] Hey, Bruce.
It is clear that the terrorists responsible for these attacks
intended to use this anthrax
as a weapon.
We still don't know who is responsible.
As you look at him, I could see how he could be a suspect.
[Vince] Whoever committed this act of bioterrorism
is somebody with a pretty extensive scientific background
and access to deadly spores.
I mean, one of the challenges we had
was relying on the scientific community.
-Yeah. …to help us in the investigation.
What time?
How do we know that they were being helpful?
And so, Bruce was definitely somebody that needed to be looked at.
[Brad] Any time you interview somebody, particularly on something at this level,
would be a little bit, I suppose, like a chess match
because you're dealing with somebody that's clearly intelligent.
You're obviously trying to get them to tell you what they have done,
if in fact they've done anything.
-Really sorry to keep you guys waiting. -Not a problem.
We appreciate-- I was working in the hot suite and it's quite a process to de-gown.
I was working in the hot suite and it's quite a process to de-gown. Let me tell you.
Have a seat, Doctor.
Yeah, thank you.
I'm Special Agent Hayward. This is my partner, Agent Braxton.
I'm very happy to meet you.
We appreciate your help with the sample analysis.
[Bruce] Of course, my pleasure.
[Hayward] You say here the, uh, spores
found in the letters are not garage spores.
What does that mean?
It means they're highly purified.
99% refractile. No vegetative cells or debris.
Any idea who could make something like this?
Someone with specialized training.
Someone with access to industrial manufacturing tools.
Oh, so, someone like you.
[chuckles] I wish. To produce powder of that purity from wet spores,
you'd need serious equipment.
Much better than we have in this dump.
We were stuck from the standpoint that we really did have to rely on the people
that were the experts.
[Brad] But the problem we had was, we had zero evidence
that one of these scientists was the ultimate culprit.
And so, you know, the question is how to stop this anthrax thing
where we had no clue when it would stop, if it would stop.
[reporter 1] Good evening, Tom. Military experts say the powder in that letter sent to Senator Daschle
the powder in that letter sent to Senator Daschle was the same biological type as in the other letters.
was the same biological type as in the other letters.
But so pure and so extremely fine, it was clearly designed to kill.
Inside that innocent-looking…
[woman] When we heard about the Daschle letter, that's when it felt closer to home.
I was like, "Wow, in order for them to get their mail,
it has to come through Brentwood."
So I kinda, like, went inside myself just to stay calm.
This mail had to come through our building.
[Paul] These letters are pushed through rollers,
and then the spores that are inside the letter
could doubtlessly get pushed out through any cracks.
A little bit of that powder gets out, and it just flies.
I want to thank you for joining us here today.
As, you know, one letter
from among the more than 3.5 million pieces of mail
handled here each day
contained Anthrax.
That letter was extremely well sealed,
and there is only a minute chance
that anthrax spores escaped from it into this facility.
When it first hit the national news,
I said to myself, "Oh, boy."
My brother Joe dealt with all the mail
that would come through Brentwood at that time.
I talked to him on the phone. I said, "Joe, please. Please be careful."
And he said, "I will, I am."
I just had this feeling of foreboding.
Knowing that you probably in a place that's not safe,
but then somebody's telling you it's safe and you're trying to trust them.
And then you find out later you can't trust 'em at all.
[man 3] Our plant manager said, "We're going to have some people come in and test."
"They're gonna have on the Hazmat gear from head to toe."
Why did they have Hazmat gear on if everything was safe?
[interviewer] Just to be clear,
you guys could see people in moon suits walking around the plant?
Yes.
They just told us to stay out of their way.
[technician] Six FKC pumps for an unknown volume flow…
And then, our plant manager goes,
"You know what, if we shut the building down,
then the terrorists wins."
Why would you feel that we should not have been tested and the building closed?
They were telling the media and the workers the same thing.
"It's nothing to worry about."
"Anthrax isn't in the building."
And that's when it happened.
Our chests started to hurt.
All of us started having dizziness or, um, headaches,
and I could see Joseph Curseen.
He sat on there and his head was kind of down.
That stood out because he's-- he had never taken a sick day off work.
And then not long after that,
you start hearing about another postal worker, Thomas Morris.
-[static hisses] -[Thomas] Um…
[Joan] It was early in the morning when Joe's wife woke up.
Joe wasn't there in the bed,
she went to their bathroom and he was sprawled out.
I don't know whether he had
defecated on himself-- I mean, he was just out.
He was that sick
and she called the ambulance, called my parents,
um, and when they got there,
they could… I guess they took them to an area,
and they could actually hear him heaving.
And I tried to call home and I kept calling and calling.
That's when my mother told me Joe was dead.
And I dropped the phone and, uh…
[man 4] A short while ago, I briefed the president with the latest facts
on the anthrax situation, as we know them.
Two postal employees
who work at the Brentwood Mail Facility here in Washington, D.C.
became critically ill, tragically, ultimately passed away.
[Joan] That Saturday, we buried Joe.
And, let me tell you something.
If it weren't for my faith,
I would have lost my mind
behind losing my brother,
especially like that.
[George W. Bush] We mourn the loss of the lives of Thomas Morris and Joseph Curseen.
Postal workers who died in the line of duty.
We have seen the horrors terrorists can inflict.
Overseas,
and here at home.
But one thing is for certain.
These terrorists must be pursued.
They must be defeated.
And they must be brought to justice.
[Brad] As far as high-profile, pressurized cases, I can't think of anything as big as this.
We were, many times on a weekly basis,
going to FBI headquarters and briefing the director
as to what's going on in this case.
Good morning. I want you to know our investigators are hard at work.
Good morning. I want you to know our investigators are hard at work. Are hard at work in New York, in Florida,
in New Jersey, uh, in D.C., and throughout the country.
You gotta get this solved and we need to move on here.
We're not in a position at this point to determine, uh, those who are responsible.
I'm just gonna leave it there.
[reporter 2] A biological killer sent through the mail.
The letters killed five people…
…and made 17 others sick. The case remains an unsolved mystery.
[Brad] Over a period of time, the case agents and the postal inspectors
the case agents and the postal inspectors
were able to develop, sort of, the movement
of these letters from a particular mailbox,
which was Princeton, New Jersey.
Postal inspectors take these mailings very seriously.
This afternoon, I am announcing the offer of a reward of up to $1 million.
Quickly you want to figure out how to rule people out
and how to rule people in.
And so, we were looking at every possible angle one could.
Right? Someone at some point noticed that certain letters were heavily bolded.
Some of the A's and the T's.
What does that mean?
Maybe it means nothing, but maybe it means something.
What could it mean?
It's another thing to look at as you're trying to narrow down who did this.
[Bruce] This is the coolest part. Look at this.
The elongated morphology.
These, uh, centipede-looking things?
[Bruce] Each bacterium is coated with a smooth mono-amino acid shell
that blocks the T-cells from recognizing it as a pathogen.
Understand?
Not a word. Continue.
[Bruce] That's how it survives.
It makes itself seem harmless, slips past the defenses.
Even though there's about 15 labs that produce the Ames strain,
it's still sort of a needle in a haystack
because you have no idea which lab it came from.
There was a couple of scientists at USAMRIID
who were working directly with the powders from the letters.
They noticed that when they plated the spores out onto Petri dishes
at a small frequency,
some of the anthrax looked different. It had different morphology.
And those differences then
would be a way to figure out,
not just whether you have the Ames strain,
but whether you actually have the Ames strain
that ended up in the anthrax letters.
And sure enough, all of those samples
that had the morphs were at USAMRIID.
[Jeffrey] USAMRIID was founded in the early '70s
as a biological defense organization.
In particular, infectious diseases that have been weaponized.
So, like most of our scientists,
I had this nagging sense that
we, or somebody that we knew, would be caught up,
um, and… and accused of being behind this.
When, in fact, we had nothing to do with it.
Doctor, for the record…
Were you involved in any way in the anthrax mailings
of September and October, 2001?
Absolutely not.
Any ideas who might have been?
Oh, yes. Lots.
Not only do these two particular researchers
have access to the original strain, they--
They also routinely make serial dilutions.
We keep a detailed record of all that activity.
Appreciate your help.
We'll be in touch.
[Paul] The FBI said, "Okay, all the people who had access to the Ames strain,
send us a sample."
Under subpoena, all of the scientists at USAMRIID,
including Bruce, would have had to have gone into their collection,
sampled each of their tubes,
and then the FBI would have sent that to my laboratory for DNA analysis,
and also for long-term storage.
And when they did the analysis for the morphs,
none of the scientists' tubes have the morphs.
And so they weren't part of the anthrax letters sources.
[Paul] Bruce was in the clear.
The anthrax was identified as the Ames strain,
commonly used in U.S. government labs.
One of those labs is located on the Fort Detrick Army Base in Maryland,
but without a solid suspect, conspiracy theories persist,
especially since the killer hasn't struck again.
Michael Jordan, in his first comments since confirming his NBA comeback says…
[Braxton] You said you had something for us.
[Bruce] I sure do. This is really cool.
You're gonna love this. It's… Okay, here we go.
[Brad] Now that Bruce Ivins had been eliminated as a suspect…
…he could help us maybe narrow this down.
[Hayward] These are anthrax cultures.
Agent Hayward, I'm very impressed.
Yes, that's exactly what those are.
Those are from my personal stock,
straight from the source.
Bruce was really enamored by the idea that, you know, his contributions and through his science
would help them to solve this case.
[Hayward] What else can you tell us?
[Paul] Bruce's main project at the time was a new vaccine.
We were all vaccinated,
but this was a vaccine that went back decades and decades,
and some people who got that anthrax vaccine
ended up with knots on their arms the size of grapefruit.
So he was trying to make a vaccine that was just as effective,
but didn't cause the side effects.
He was normal for a scientist,
but he was out there a little bit by your general population.
He definitely was one of those geeky, nerdy guys that you see across the room.
Like me. Like me. [laughs]
Okay, so, here are some of the most objectionable aspects about me.
One. Giving bad advice when no advice was asked for or needed.
Two. Being demanding.
Three. Asking personal questions
that are none of my business, also known as the "Grand Ivins Inquiry."
[Jeffrey] He played piano,
he fooled around with the banjo…
You know, he had a lot of talents like that.
[man] Bruce!
[Bruce] Shit!
There's Bruce Ivins, you know, doing, uh, something unusual again.
[Bruce] Okay, so, four.
Interrupting people and then monopolizing the conversations.
-Five. Calling people at home. -[line ringing]
-[woman on phone] Hello? -Hey.
Six. Talking a mile a minute,
and then asking several questions without waiting for the answers.
I think that pretty much covers it.
[man on radio] By the time a piece of mail makes it through the postal system,
it is gathered and dumped and sorted, shaken, jostled, and squeezed.
So everyone's a little edgy,
no group more so than the nation's postal workers.
[man] I'd just like to say that this is a very sad time for the postal service.
We mourn the loss of two of our soldiers on the front line,
and we're gonna do what we can, uh, to… to deliver America's mail.
[Terrence] Finally, after ten days,
the building had been shut down.
They told us that everybody more than likely had an exposure.
[reporter 3] More than 2,200 D.C. postal workers
have been urged to get tested for Anthrax exposure.
Employees are being…
When it first came out, when Congress got tested,
everyone should have got tested.
At Brentwood, they kept the building open for 24 hours,
seven days a week, for ten straight days.
[Terrence] There were forklifts, power oxes riding through.
People moving around, shuffling, spores flying everywhere.
Machines running 35 miles an hour.
And when you look back at the Hart Senate Office Building,
what we see is what a building really looks like when people are in danger.
About 10:30 a.m. this morning,
my office, uh, opened a suspicious package,
and the good news is that,
uh, everyone will be okay.
That building was shut down in two hours.
Evacuated everybody, tested everybody, everybody's safe.
Two hundred and forty hours versus two hours.
The dogs got Cipro on Capitol Hill before we did.
They say there were five deaths.
Seventeen people got sick.
No, they don't know how many people…
My x-rays show that my lungs look like I've been a heavy smoker,
or like I have a lung disease.
I never smoked a day in my life.
When this happens to you, you become obsessed.
[woman] And then a picture of the "No Photos" sign
at the entrance of the Brentwood Post Office,
as well as the machinery
and the tents
in which these Hazmat teams, uh, worked out of.
The tunnels leading up to the building to put the…
[man 1] The chlorine dioxide.
[woman] Dioxide…
[man 2] Zoom in on… on…
Okay, yeah. They got warnings on the building here.
[Dena] This was about them knowing that the building was contaminated
and keeping us in there and jeopardizing our lives.
They… They should have done better.
[reporter 4] For two months, investigators have been searching
for the culprit in the anthrax-by-mail attacks.
That's one thing that lurks in the back of a lot of postal people's mind,
that it's been done once, and they got away with it, they could do it again.
And then we'll be right back where we started.
[reporter 5] Who sent letters laced with the biological hazard and why?
[reporter 6] An invisible enemy killing Americans, one breath at a time.
[reporter 7] Just like DNA,
we're solving crimes today that we couldn't solve ten years ago
because science has improved. We hope that's going to be the case
with the anthrax case also.
[newscaster] It's been nine months since the wave of deadly anthrax letters
began passing through the U.S. mail.
New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof joins us now live.
You've come up with some suspicions of your own.
Why don't you tell our viewers what they are?
He's somebody who's in the biodefense community,
uh, in the kind of military intelligence establishment.
There's been a lot of buzz about him,
uh, as somebody that people think should be investigated a lot more closely.
[woman] The block has been kind of swarming with guys in suits.
[woman] They just showed us a picture, asked if we had recognized this fella.
A gentleman with kind of dark hair, a bushy mustache, kind of close-set eyes.
[reporter 1] FBI agents have searched the apartment
of a former Army researcher named Dr. Steven Hatfill.
There was a lot of… aspects of what Dr. Hatfill had done and said,
uh, that made him, quite appropriately,
the leading suspect.
[man 1] He was fired in 1999 for violating lab procedures
and then he got a job with a government contractor
and lost that security clearance for that job,
August 23rd of 2001.
Just about a month before the anthrax went in the mail.
[man 2] He was polygraphed three times, each of those three showed evasions.
[man 3] His resumes were a skeleton of truth.
[man 4] He was mad at the world, at the government.
[reporter 2] A study that he commissioned described a fictional terrorist attack.
[reporter 3] Federal agents searched Steven Hatfill's Maryland home
for a second time.
Hatfill has denied any involvement in the anthrax attacks.
Let me just be clear here.
And to be fair.
This is the first bio-terror attack in our nation's history.
None of us were prepared for it.
It scared the American public. It scared Congress.
But nothing justified the treatment that he received here, nothing whatsoever.
I'll give you some sound checks, fellas.
Tell me if this works for you.
[Tom] And so I came on to represent him
in a case that if it was brought,
was undoubtedly going to be a death penalty case.
Dr. Hatfill deserves to get his life back,
and the American public deserves a real investigation.
[Tom] Look what actually happened here. Okay?
They signal to the American public
that Dr. Hatfill was the person who committed this horrendous attack.
[reporter] Is Dr. Hatfill a suspect?
Well, he's a person of interest.
"Person of interest."
[overlapping reporters speaking] Person of interest…
It had such a huge draw from the media.
And, like, they're all over the place,
and there's helicopters above his apartment.
A couple of dopey agents fell madly in love with him.
It was like a teenage romance crush,
and they just kept pushing a round peg in a square hole.
They essentially engaged in a campaign
with their friends in the press
to continually suggest to the American public
that Dr. Hatfill has committed this offense.
They did so without any evidence because they were happy
to have a patsy here, to suggest to the public that we're making progress.
It says to me that there's some good gumshoe detective work going on
and they're hot on the trail of somebody.
People had differing views about how much they believe
whether Hatfill was the right guy or not.
But the problem is they just couldn't eliminate Steven.
They had me actually interview him more than once.
You know, we start talking about, you know, his history with anthrax.
And he says, "You guys don't believe me."
"You think I did this."
And, you know, my response to that was "Well, Steve,
did you do it?" And he says, "Of course not, I didn't do it."
But the bureau still thought he was the right guy,
and that's… that's why they moved forward.
Now, one possible outcome
sources suggest is that the government could bring charges against Hatfill
unrelated to the anthrax attacks at all,
if they become convinced
that's the only way to stop future incidents…
[newscaster] And still no arrests,
even though investigators believe they know who the culprit is
and where he is.
What's going on here?
This is, like, real pressure.
You have him under surveillance 24-7.
You're following him every place he goes.
[reporter] And he's often publicly tailed by the FBI
so closely that an agent drove over his foot three months ago.
The fuckin' dogs.
They opened the doors of the apartment
and one of the dogs just excitedly bounded across the room
and went straight up to Dr. Hatfill.
Now, what they didn't tell
was that the dogs alerted on eight or nine other scientists.
So, that's the equivalent of saying-- telling your boss,
"Hey, I've got Dan's fingerprints on a gun,"
and not telling him,
"By the way, I got ten other fingerprints on the gun that aren't Dan's."
This is in-your-face harassment.
This was not surveillance.
This was a design to sweat him.
The pressure the criminal suspect has when the FBI has them under scrutiny,
can lead them to break and do awful things,
including committing suicide.
He was so… [hesitates] …distressed about the media,
and for whatever reason,
they knew where we were going to interview him.
I mean, it got so bad at one location
that we actually put him in the back of a vehicle and took him to a hotel.
[Rachel] I wasn't there and I'm not going to judge the day-to-day on that,
but I will say,
when you have somebody who you think committed this major bioweapons attack,
you're gonna want to look at every aspect of his life
and you're going to want to interview his friends
and you're going to want to perhaps physically surveil him.
It's… It frankly would be malpractice if they hadn't done some of those things.
[Tom] Of course he should have been investigated.
No one has ever complained
that the FBI shouldn't have looked at him.
The complaint is,
you wrenched him from all the other people that they were looking at
and put him forefront in the American public and said,
"He's our guy."
That's what happened here, and that's the complaint.
[Tom] Guess what? Once you burn a man's house down,
and then take his clothes
and then spit in his face…
Guess what?
He's gonna fight back.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Steve Hatfill.
After one of the most intensive public and private investigations
in American history, no one,
in American history, no one, no one has come up with a shred of evidence
that I had anything to do
with the anthrax letters.
I am not the Anthrax Killer!
We're almost a year now into the anthrax investigation
and the FBI doesn't have a clue who's responsible.
[reporter 2] FBI officials say there are just too many questions
[reporter 2] FBI officials say there are just too many questions about Hatfill to back off now.
Some involved in the case are clearly frustrated.
More than 18 months later, there has not been one single arrest…
And it does seem like the FBI works very slowly, which makes us wonder…
Well, it's like this. It's not television.
There's a lot of legwork…
[reporter 1] Does it disappoint you? A case like this, unsolved, no arrests, no indictment?
[reporter 2] As of this moment, is he still being investigated?
We may not have the admissible evidence
that we need in order to prove it in court.
[reporter 3] Remember the anthrax scare?
It was five years ago today that a photographer in Florida…
[reporter 4] There's a split at the FBI
with some agents now thinking Hatfill didn't do it,
but others still believe he did.
It's one of the largest FBI investigations ever
with more than 9,000 interviews,
6,000 subpoenas, and 67 separate searches.
The FBI insists this case remains active.
The fatal flaw that some people have is
trying to prove that somebody committed a crime,
versus just investigating the crime.
The investigation had been going on for five years,
and Director Mueller wanted to have some new eyes in there.
And so I took over the investigation.
I told the team, "This case might be old,
but it's not stale and it's not like we don't care."
"We still have, you know, resources dedicated to it."
We told everybody-- Like, we empowered them to investigate.
[Rachel] At that point, there was an incredibly aggressive development of the science,
and it became the game-changing piece of the investigation.
[Paul] Previously, nobody was sequencing genomes.
It's what we call a pre-genomics era.
We were using DNA to identify the Ames strain,
but we hadn't sequenced the whole genome.
[Vince] What they wanted to do was develop a DNA fingerprint
for the spores that were mailed
to see if we could identify the parent.
And we did it because the technology improved,
but also because we had a lot of money.
This was the most expensive investigation that the FBI ever carried out.
Then they compared the DNA fingerprints
that they had identified in the spores that were mailed
to everything they'd collected.
[Paul] Those all traced back to a single flask…
called RMR-1029.
And then on top of that, we found out that this was a flask
of anthrax spores that Bruce Ivins had created for his experiments.
♪ It's a song ♪ ♪ A sigh of the weary ♪
♪ A sigh of the weary ♪
[Rachel] At the beginning of this investigation, it was this global whodunit.
The global whodunit has now shrunk to one flask in one walk-in cooler,
in one lab, created and maintained by one guy.
[interviewer] Do we know definitively at that point that Bruce Ivins sent the letters?
No. Uh…
RMR-1029 was a resource that was used by many people.
Some of the material from that had even been sent to my laboratory.
So, we looked at the relevant time period
and said, "Okay, who had access to RMR-1029 during this time period?"
The FBI swung back around and started focusing on USAMRIID again.
We were right back under the magnifying glass.
We were one of the few institutes that fully cooperated with them.
Not only providing the expertise and the assistance,
but giving full access to all of our written records,
all of our biological samples,
providing anything and everything that they wanted, on a voluntary basis.
But then, because you've created records of everything,
that gives them something to sift through,
and if something similar is found,
it's going to label you as the originator of this attack material.
You know, that was disconcerting for a lot of people
because it created a lot of fear and paranoia.
[Vince] Each one of them became a suspect, right? Get me a rock-solid alibi.
We had some people on the list that we had phone records,
where they were on the phone with their spouse who was overseas at the time.
Right? So there's no way they could have driven to Princeton
on the 17th or 18th of September
and mailed the letters.
We checked everybody else off the list.
[Vince] But then, the more we investigated Bruce, the more things that came to light.
One of the things that stuck out was his time in the hot suites,
leading up to the attacks.
Late at nights and on weekends and into the wee hours of the morning.
And going into a hot suite isn't just going into a room.
And then there was a break for about a week or so,
and then it picked up again where he was back in there.
Then he had all these hours in there leading up to the second mailing.
Never before, never since,
did he have time in the hot suites like that.
[Rachel] That, standing alone, is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt,
but it's certainly a brick in the wall of evidence.
Now with the additional knowledge
that, whoa, we think this identified flask of spores
that was created and maintained by Dr. Ivins
is the source of the murder weapon, right? Is the source of the mailed material.
Let's go back and take a look at everything he has said
and everything he's done, in a different light.
[Rachel] Going back and looking at statements he had given.
Was he sabotaging, undermining, misdirecting the investigation?
Did he try to distract?
I had one other thought. Iraq, for instance.
What else can you tell us?
-[knock on door] -Oh. Hey, guys.
Did he try to deflect?
[Bruce] Get a load of this.
Those are from my personal stock, straight from the source.
What else can you tell us?
[Rachel] Did he identify certain suspects
depending on his personal feelings towards that person at the time?
[Bruce] Not only do these two particular researchers
have access to the original strain, they also routinely make serial dilutions.
[Hayward] What else can you tell us?
Did he try to send investigators in different directions?
-Can you get us copies? -I'll fax them over this afternoon.
What else can you tell us?
Lots.
[Rachel] Here is this super respected, talented scientist within the government,
giving advice about, you know, what to pursue and what not to pursue.
[Hayward, voice echoing] What else can you tell us?
[Rachel] There was now absolutely a concerted focus on Dr. Ivins.
-[country song playing] -♪ Take me by the hand ♪
-[country song playing] -♪ Take me by the hand ♪ ♪ I will always understand… ♪
[Vince] You know, this guy checks a lot of boxes when you talk about an insider threat.
We found out that he had some mental health issues,
that it was common for him to leave at night and come home
sometime the next morning, without his wife knowing.
He maintained P.O. boxes in different names at different locations.
He would drive to remote locations
and mail something to conceal his identity.
[man] Dr. Ivins.
We're with the FBI.
[female agent] We'd like to speak with you, sir. Won't take long.
Now? Uh, I was supposed to be home an hour ago. Uh, my wife--
Your wife is being taken care of.
What… What does that mean?
Sir, we're currently executing a federal grand jury search warrant
at your home.
[Vince] That's when we jumped out of the cake, right?
"Hey, Bruce, we're executing a search warrant at your house."
"You are a big suspect in this."
[male agent] We've arranged a hotel for you and your family,
just until the search is complete.
We've got a car just over here.
Uh, no, thank you. I… I need to go home.
We'll see you on the ten o'clock news, then.
[male agent] Doctor, you go home, it's going to cause a major scene.
Neighbors start talking.
[male agent] Next thing you know, news trucks are rolling in
[male agent] Next thing you know, news trucks are rolling in like the third armored brigade.
[female agent] You don't really want that.
Do you, Dr. Ivins?
Where's Agent Hayward? I always work with Agent--
Agent Hayward is no longer assigned to this case.
What? No. No, you don't understand. Hayward is my contact--
I know this is upsetting.
Best thing is to remain calm, let us do our work.
I think I just-- I need you to stop. Stop the car. Stop.
[Bruce] You-- You're saying it was me?
You think-- You think I sent those letters? That I'm some kind of terrorist?
No one's saying that.
I'm a patriot. I've worked my entire life protecting American lives.
Sir, please.
[male agent] Let's just all keep our heads and give the team a chance to do its work.
How does that sound, Doctor?
[Vince] To be quite honest,
we didn't come out of there with a silver bullet.
There were some people that thought that he would've kept a souvenir.
Right? And we're like, "What souvenir are we gonna find?"
And there wasn't that much.
But then a couple guys on the team had a great idea.
[Vince] Two nights later was trash night.
See what he throws out that we may have missed.
Unbeknownst to him, was an FBI agent holding his breath,
standing motionless so that Bruce wouldn't see him.
He clearly wanted to make sure that nobody recovered what he threw away.
[Paul] I was in Washington at a conference in a hotel out near Dulles Airport.
Welcome, everyone.
And the FBI knew I was there and so they actually set up a meeting for me.
There were, like, 20 people there,
and they didn't have lights shining on me or anything like an interrogation,
but it kind of felt that way. It kind of felt like that environment.
And we sat down and one of them
reassured me that, uh, they were not there to arrest me.
It was like, "That had never crossed my mind until just now
that you might be here to arrest me."
And they started pulling out emails that I had sent to Bruce Ivins.
They were trying to figure out if there was any information in these emails
that might have tipped off Bruce Ivins about the analysis that we were doing.
That's when a kind of light went off in my head, said, "They're looking at Bruce."
Many of his co-workers defended him and said, "No, it couldn't be Bruce."
And when we pointed to strange behaviors, you know… [hesitates]
And when we pointed to strange behaviors, you know… [hesitates] …things that Bruce did, it was always, "Well, that's just Bruce being Bruce."
That was the common phrase we heard. "That's Bruce being Bruce."
But from looking at Bruce's emails,
it was clear that he had obsessions.
His relationships with some of his co-workers were…
You know, one woman-- he wrote a lot of personal emails
that were troubling.
Occasionally, I get this tingling that goes down both arms.
At the same time, I get a bit dizzy
and I get this unidentifiable metallic taste in my mouth.
I'm not trying to be funny.
Actually, it scares me a bit.
When I get these episodes,
I become mean-spirited,
hateful,
angry,
withdrawn,
paranoid.
Of course, I regret them thoroughly when they're over,
but when I'm going through them,
it's as if I'm a passenger on a ride.
Like I'm a few feet away watching myself.
I try to put on a good front here at work and at home so I don't spread the pestilence.
so I don't spread the pestilence.
Unfortunately, I have to talk about it to someone.
So, you get to be my secret sharer.
[Vince] His behavior toward those women was the same as another of his obsessions.
We found out that he had
an obsession with KKG Sorority.
This obsession was something that he developed in the 1960s in college
when he asked a girl on a date who belonged to KKG Sorority.
She turned him down,
and Bruce was rejected.
And so, he decided to steal from a sorority house.
He stole their cipher,
which allowed him to decrypt their rituals that they had.
And when you think about… here's a man, 40 or 50 years later,
who had multiple personas…
[Vince] …who was 60 years old,
posing as a sorority sister, online.
It kind of raises some eyebrows.
[Vince] One of the women that he had this strong interest or obsession with
defended him over and over,
until we showed her some information that he somehow identified her password
and would log on to her computer, as her,
and read her personal emails.
And whenever he read something disparaging against him,
then he was just enraged by it.
It was pretty disturbing, and she agreed to cooperate with us.
Bruce.
-You came. -I came. [chuckles]
I just keep thinking about that grand jury hearing.
They were so accusatory.
You can't keep going on like this, Bruce.
Sure I can. See?
Maybe you should see somebody.
I have you.
My secret sharer.
Don't call me that.
I'm… I'm sorry, Bruce. I want to support you, I do.
But these things that you've been writing me about…
[accomplice] Alternate personas, paranoid delusions…
So this woman actually wore a wire to… to meet with Bruce.
Just let him volunteer and see how comfortable he gets.
-[accomplice] I don't know what to do. -The crazy thing about those emails is
I don't even remember actually writing them.
What?
The first I know about them is when I see them in my sent box in the morning.
I wake up and there's all these traces of what Crazy Bruce has been doing.
I see keys by my bed and I think, "Oh, no, did I drive somewhere?"
For somebody who's a suspect in a bioterrorism event, right?
It's alarming to us.
I want to ask you something. But please don't get mad at me.
You want to know if I did it. You want to know if I sent those letters.
Yes.
I can't recall doing anything like that.
But you're not sure?
The only thing I know for sure
is that in my right mind, I would never hurt anyone.
"Did you kill five people?"
It's a pretty easy question to answer for most people, right?
And Bruce didn't say no.
You know, I was thinking, this friend of mine,
her therapist hypnotizes her.
-No. -And it helps her. -I said no. -It helps her remember.
-I said no. -It helps her remember. What if I don't want to remember?
But, Br-- Bruce, wait.
Don't go.
Sit down.
You used to be so beautiful.
[Bruce] It's getting to be lately, I felt there's nobody in the world I can confide in.
I used to walk at night through a bad part of town
with a loaded gun in my windbreaker.
If I saw a group of young guys on the street,
I'd walk right through the middle of them.
Just hoping someone would try something.
You have to battle back.
Look these bastards in the eye and say,
"You're not going to drive me into a hole."
"You go after me, I'll go after you."
Bruce? Bruce?
Just remember what I said. Short and direct.
No unnecessary details.
Gonna do great.
Appreciate you coming in today.
I'm Vince Lisi, Special Agent in charge here.
We just wanted to let him know we had him.
Okay if I call you Bruce?
Sure, Vince.
Look, I want to be very clear.
This interview here, it's voluntary. You're here on your own accord.
-In the presence of your attorney. -I understand.
An enormous amount of work
was put into getting ready for that first interview of Dr. Ivins.
We had a very careful plan
that involved both what questions we want to ask,
how do we want to ask them,
but also consulting with a psychologist about how do we approach him.
Right? What are the triggers, what are the aspects that are going to get him talking.
So, tell me, Bruce.
What's the deal with you and women?
Excuse me?
Two former female co-workers said you hounded them for over a decade.
One said you threatened to poison her?
Now there's this whole thing with a Kappa Kappa Gamma Sorority.
A "preoccupation," it says.
I wouldn't call it a preoccupation.
[Vince] No? What would you call it?
An obsession.
He just cut me off. He goes, "It's not an interest. It's an obsession."
He said "I just lay in bed at night and this just goes through my head."
It says that you broke into a sorority house
at the University of North Carolina to steal their code books.
Interested in codes, Bruce?
Not especially.
You know, I read somewhere
that you can write secret messages using DNA codons.
Ever hear anything like that?
Doesn't sound familiar.
-[dramatic music playing] -[Vince] How 'bout now?
[Bruce's lawyer] This was not on the search and seizure inventory.
I found it in his trash.
And that's whenever they found some, uh, some pretty, pretty interesting and damning, uh, items.
An Eternal Golden Braid. That's a-- That's a good book.
I mean, at least the parts I could understand.
Gödel, Escher, Bach was the book he had that he was very interested in
that talked about codes and coded language.
Hey, Bruce. What the heck is a codon, anyway?
Okay, you're asking Dr. Ivins to teach remedial science to the FBI now?
The letters A and T are used in DNA codons, right?
We knew that there was a hidden message in the letter.
Bold a T in one word and then you bold an A in another word
and use that to send hidden messages.
And they kind of had an idea of how it was translated.
We knew both from talking to Dr. Ivins
and from things he had written, that Dr. Ivins hated New York.
The bolded letters translated into "FNY."
Take, what you will, the FNY.
"Fuck New York."
Mr. Lisi, we agreed to come here in the spirit of cooperation.
I don't appreciate you trying to intimidate my client.
You feeling intimidated, Bruce?
All that matters here is the science.
We talked about the submission to the repository.
I mean, it was just, like, one fastball after another.
Six years ago, you submitted a sample of anthrax in your custody, came back clean.
Negative match.
Yeah.
[Vince] There was another sample.
The original one.
It was supposed to be destroyed because, well, you didn't follow protocol.
You used the wrong test tubes, or some nonsense.
What?
Wrong test tubes. The lab guys are very particular.
Someone kept it, Bruce.
Let me back up, because actually, you prepare two, right?
One sample goes to the repository, and one sample goes to Paul Keim.
The tube that came to me,
the FBI didn't ever tell me to get rid of 'em.
And so, that first set of tubes that he sent to me
stayed in our repository for the next four years.
That one came back a match.
The same DNA markers as the spores that killed those five people in 2001.
We traced it to a flask labeled RMR-1029.
Which you control.
A dozen people have access to that flask.
Fourteen, actually.
But you're so sure it's me?
I think we are finished here. [clears throat] Dr. Ivins.
Why'd you submit two different samples, Bruce?
Can you explain why?
[Vince] So after Bruce's first sample was refused by the repository and it was destroyed,
he, uh, attended this meeting
and was told exactly what the samples were going to be used for.
Right? So now he's thinking, "Wait a minute…"
Doctor, please, follow protocol to the letter this time.
[Vince] "So when I submit my new sample of RMR-1029,
I'll put something else in there, so it doesn't point back to me."
He got a second bite at the apple, right?
[Hayward] We appreciate your help.
[Vince] Can you explain that?
I'm not a killer.
Let's see what a jury says.
[Jeffrey] The one thing Bruce was not is an emotionally strong person.
The FBI isolated him from most of his friends and family.
His reputation had been sullied.
He seemed to be moving away from his former self.
The first thing I noticed was that he wasn't
primarily interested in getting other people to laugh
or to engage with other people.
He became somewhat withdrawn.
He admitted that he had been drinking and that he wasn't sleeping well.
I think he even had an issue with a mental health professional
that he was seeing.
[Paul] He actually had a restraining order against him by his counselor.
There was a dark side to Bruce that many of us didn't see.
[Bruce] I have this terrible dreaded feeling that…
I have been selected for the blood sacrifice.
The FBI can take the most innocent moment or incident
and turn it into something that looks as if it came from the devil himself.
I don't have a killer bone in my body, but it doesn't make a difference.
I miss the days…
I miss the days that people would say that I was sane without a snicker.
I miss the days when I felt that we were doing what was worthy and honest.
what was worthy and honest.
Our pasts shape our futures.
And mine was built
with lies and craziness and depression.
Go down low. Low.
Low as you can go.
And then dig forever.
And there you'll find me.
My psyche.
Alone.
The farther I go, it's alone.
[operator] Frederick County 911. What is the address of the emergency?
[woman] Military Road.
-[operator] And what's your name? -Diane Ivins.
[operator] Diane, what's the problem? Tell me exactly what happened.
[Diane] My husband, I found him laying on the bathroom floor upstairs.
He's unconscious. He's got a…
He's breathing rapidly, he's clammy.
I found some…
a glass of wine earlier in the day.
I don't know if he was drinking and got up and fell or...
if he drank too much.
[operator] All right, I'm sending the ambulance to help you now.
Want me to stay on the line with you or are you okay?
[Diane] No, I'm okay.
[reporter 1] Bruce Ivins, a brilliant microbi--
[reporter 2] Tuesday, Ivins died of an apparent overdose.
[reporter 3] The nation's most notorious unsolved terrorist crime.
The death of Bruce Ivins--
[reporter 4] …was a delusional sociopath.
[reporter 5] A history of mental illness.
It was his own fault.
One of the largest and most complex investigations--
[reporter 6] …had the opportunity, motive, and means to be the 2001 Anthrax Killer.
Good afternoon.
Because of the extraordinary and justified public interest in this investigation,
as well as the significant public attention resulting from the death
of Dr. Bruce Edward Ivins last week,
today we are compelled to take the extraordinary step
of providing some of our conclusions.
We are confident
that Dr. Ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks.
How is it possible that a guy in this state of mind
could have tricked the FBI
for so long?
Officials say authorities were investigating
whether Ivins released anthrax as a way of testing the vaccine
he developed here at Fort Detrick.
[interviewer] Are you a hundred percent certain Bruce did it?
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. Beyond a reasonable doubt.
Bruce was worried that his life's work
dedicated to anthrax research was gonna come to an end.
Right? And then the anthrax attacks happen
and all of a sudden the FDA quickly approves this batch of vaccines,
and all of a sudden the FDA quickly approves this batch of vaccines, and then Bruce ended up getting the highest award a civilian can get
in the Army for his work on anthrax.
No.
He's responsible for five murders. You know?
[interviewer] How certain are you that Bruce was responsible?
Yeah, I'm-- I'm not certain that he was the mailer.
It's not like a murder case, you know,
where you have a blood stain and you can come back and say,
"Absolutely, this belongs to that person. That puts them at the crime scene."
In the case of the anthrax with the DNA, uh,
we just put the… the suspect or the perpetrator in the vicinity
of the flask.
It's a circumstantial case.
There's no silver bullet here,
but… and if you want to look at any one little aspect
and pick it apart, that's fine.
But I tell people it's like looking at the Mona Lisa through a drinking straw.
Right? You got to step back and look at the whole thing.
[reporter 1] Former supervisor Jeffrey Adamovicz says Ivins knew he was under suspicion.
If this case is closed and that evidence was not sufficient
to indicate that he was the person who did this,
that means that person is still out there.
[Jeffrey] I think the FBI was under tremendous political pressure
to solve this case.
But it was clear that these spores had been processed in such a way
that they had characteristics and features that weren't consistent
with the spores that we made.
And it didn't seem that Bruce had the technical knowledge
to do that, nor did anybody else at the institute.
And that's what still bothers me to this day about this entire case.
[Vince] Bruce would tell us that he didn't have the skill set to grow the spores.
But I met with a leading scientist and said,
"How many people do you know that can make spores like this?"
And he goes, "That I know of?"
"Maybe six or eight."
Bruce was one of the first names.
[reporter 2] While the FBI believes it's solved the case,
an attorney for the Ivins family says nothing could be further from the truth.
The evidence does not directly tie Ivins to the anthrax letters,
but with the suspect now dead,
the government will never have to prove that link.
[Paul] I was very disappointed in the FBI
because there was still a lot to learn,
and instead they closed the case and they destroyed the evidence.
Almost all of those spores and samples have now been destroyed,
and so, uh, there's no chance to go back and reopen this and look at it.
[newscaster] Now to that anthrax investigation,
as you know, the prime suspect committed suicide--
[reporter 3] News crews now descending upon the widow's home…
You know, when I found out that he committed suicide,
I thought through it a lot.
I'd seen what the FBI had done with Steven Hatfill.
The pressure that they'd put on him
to try to break him…
[Diane] It wasn't unusual for him to sleep all day
because he's been depressed and concerned about this investigation.
He's been incredibly, incredibly stressed because of the way he's been hounded
by the FBI.
[man] I can imagine.
[Diane] And I felt that he couldn't take it anymore.
[Jeffrey] Bruce talked about them threatening his family,
trying to get his children to testify against him.
Maybe he sent the letters, and maybe he didn't.
But it was the pressure of the FBI is why Bruce committed suicide.
It's really hard for me to hear that,
when I feel like we're accused of driving him to suicide.
We did everything we could to both keep him safe, right?
To protect himself and protect the public,
but also pursuing him aggressively because we had to,
because we were convinced he was the one who committed the anthrax attacks.
[reporter 4] The investigation into the Anthrax Killer
is being called the FBI's most expensive undertaking ever.
The agency spent more than $10 million…
Over the past seven years, they've followed up 50,000 leads
on six continents,
conducted 9,000-plus interviews,
and issued 6,000 grand jury subpoenas.
They never let this go.
What could ever possibly motivate somebody to mail anthrax
and kill innocent victims?
And when you think about the letters themselves,
the letters didn't get to Tom Brokaw. They didn't get to Senator Daschle.
But who are the people who get sick?
Mr. Stevens in Florida.
The people who opened the letters in NBC.
Let's close off…
[Rachel] The people who were working in the Hart Senate Office Building.
People were coming in contact with it just through the course of their, like, duty
as a civilian employee of the U.S. Postal Service.
[male official] We have provided you copies of the court documents
which give details…
When I heard about the press conference,
I said, "Okay, I need to be there."
I have a postal press badge
and they let me in.
How big a factor was Dr. Hatfill? How did the FBI get so off track?
If you talk a little more about the meeting with the family…
[Dena] I have a question.
-Yes, in the back. -I'd like to ask the Postal Inspector…
Um, when are you-- Are you planning to brief or speak with the postal workers
who were affected, or is that the end of it?
Um, we, today, this morning, sent out a letter from the Postmaster General
to all of our postal employees.
I was just appalled that they dismissed us like that,
and they just continue to dismiss us.
I would like to know, are you all planning to do anything to meet with us
so that we can, um, get a briefing and also ask our questions?
Of course, we'll answer the questions
as the questions come in to, uh, to the Postal Service.
But remember, we have 700,000 employees across the country.
Brentwood was renamed
the Joseph P. Curseen Junior and Thomas Morris Junior
Processing and Distribution Facility.
And I thought that was a beautiful tribute.
I can't hold bitterness.
I can't hold hatred.
Obviously… He… He… This person had issues,
and something wasn't quite right there.
And because we're all intertwined,
innocent people get caught up in it.
I feel bad for him, that if he did this, that his mind took him there.
[Casey] Clearly, suicide is horrible and terrible,
but the fact that I knew that this person who may have killed five people
wasn't alive anymore… is that a terrible thing to say? I…
I was just somewhat relieved that he wasn't around anymore.
Sorry, God.
[Terrence] The names on that building,
it's a testament for us as to what happened,
you know? And, um…
I'm sorry.
[sniffling] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
[voice breaking] But…
Um… I'm sorry…
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. So…
I think different people
walk away from this with different things.
And I think we're still learning from the experience.
My throat was raw and I couldn't hardly swallow.
I could barely eat. I couldn't keep anything down.
I was having problems breathing. My throat was real sore.
I feel as though we were betrayed.
[man 1] This is the video deposition of John Ashcroft.
[man 2] Is it appropriate for Department of Justice officials
to suggest that Dr. Hatfill fits a behavioral profile
of the Anthrax Killer?
I don't know.
[man 2] You don't know whether it was appropriate
to disclose that kind of information?
I don't know.
[man 2] Do you think it's fair to Dr. Hatfill?
I don't know.
What direct evidence do you have?
For instance, do you have any tape that was used on the envelope
that was recovered from his home?
Do you have any other, uh, evidence
that clearly would link him? For instance, the affidavit mentions
that people of this sort often keep souvenirs.
[reporter 1] It was known as the "Quantico Letter." It was a letter sent in September of 2001 identifying an Arab-American scientist…
[reporter 2] Were you able to place him at the mailboxes in Princeton?
Like a gas receipt?
[official] We don't have that piece of direct evidence you mention.
Thank you, Ma.
Nebraska! Nebraska!
-OJ! -Hello.
Nene, how are you?
[chuckles] I should be asking you.
You're taking this very well.
Taking what? What are you talking about?
My dear, if it were some people, they would have been crying and hiding by now.
First it was your sister, Reme,
now, Osato, your youngest sister.
My dear, you know, she should be the one serving at your wedding,
not the other way around.
-You know, I just think you... -No, no, no.
Nene, enough!
[clicks tongue] Excuse me.
I'm telling you! -You've got to know your selling point. -[woman laughs]
And sell your market!
-You kill me! -Kukua!
But it's true!
Ah! Babes. Easy, easy, easy...
Wow. I fear for that cup, oh. What's up now?
I fear for that cup, oh. What's up now?
So, I expected a few, "Ah, God will do your own, oh,"
or "Don't worry, your own will soon come,"
but my family is not playing.
Even my deadbeat cousin's wife,
who has three children under five at 25,
even that one had something to say to me.
I wanted to slap at her nonsense mouth! Ah...
Yes, I'm 34, and two of my younger sisters are married.
No, I don't have a boyfriend,
and no, I'm not gonna kill myself.
I am freaking fine!
[woman] Do you want another drink? I think you should have more. Here's some more.
[woman] Do you want another drink? I think you should have more. Here's some more. There you go, relax. It's OK. It's OK.
There you go, relax. It's OK. It's OK.
I've told you...
Hey, Sis, Mummy and Auntie Adesuwa are calling you.
What for?
I don't know. Maybe they found you another husband candidate.
-[all sigh] -Hey Agnes, let's take selfies.
OK.
[grunts] What's wrong with this boy, oh?
I'm old enough to be your big sister!
Age is nothing but a number, man.
By the way, the ladies are loving the cool MC,
Nosa! Sorry, am I dreaming?
Nosa, you're now a rapper? What happened to acting?
[grunts] The money wasn't that great, so... I've still got to have mad skills.
Even Davido and Wizkid ain't got nothing on the cool MC Nosa!
-[women laughing] -This boy is silly.
-You know what, you know what? -[women laughing]
-Take your silly dollars off my face. -There's more where that came from.
Will you get out of here and go and get me some puff puff, rapper?
Um... you know, you're already "puff".
You know you shouldn't... you shouldn't be taking...
Hey! Your mother puff puff!
-[woman laughs] -Idiot! Calling me puff puff? -Silly boy! -I should slap him.
-Silly boy! -I should slap him.
I don't like it now. What kind of nonsense scarf is this?
I don't know why you tied this nonsense scarf.
You look like a market woman. Leave me. I like it like that.
See your sister, looking like a proper woman.
Yeah, whatever.
Mummy, you know what, you just need to stop with all this, your disastrous matchmaking.
See, your mouth like disastrous. Did you bring a man home?
-[Reme gasps] -Aw, that was low, Mummy.
Whatever!
Don't worry, you are going to love this one.
He's from America,
and his mother happens to be the president of our church society.
And he's from a very good home.
He's a real stud.
If he's such a stud, why does he need his mum arranging dates for him? [gasps excitedly] Auntie Itohan!
[gasps excitedly] Auntie Itohan!
[sighs] Thank you for honoring us with your presence.
Well, we were already at the Doherty's wedding,
so I said, eh, why don't we stop by on the way home?
Aw, thank you. Thank you so much.
This is Reme.
-Good evening, Ma. -She's married.
-And this is Isoken. -Good evening, Ma.
Your daughters are very pretty.
Ah, thank you. [laughing excitedly]
This is my son, Osaze.
Osaze, how are you, my dear?
Beautiful party, ma'am. Thank you, thank you.
Nice hair tie...
It's very, um... different.
Oh, thank you.
You see?
Stop shining your teeth and ask the man what he will eat.
Mummy...
Shall we go and sit down, please?
Please, after you, after you.
Yeah, that was bad. But trust me, no one comes close to my mother.
But they did good this time though.
Yeah, I think they did.
So, dinner tomorrow night?
Whoa, that was quick.
I know what I want when I see it.
Isoken, Isoken!
Osato wants us to dance with her. Come on!
-Do you mind? -No, go ahead.
But why don't you come along? Why don't you dance with us?
But why don't you come along? Why don't you dance with us? No, no, no. I'll make an absolute fool of myself.
No, no, no. I'll make an absolute fool of myself. I can't dance to that music. No...
Americana! Come, I'll teach you. I will. Come on.
OK.
Hey, hey, you, Isoken, you just kept us hanging like that.
What's she on about?
Give us the gist about this Saze guy.
Gossip! Instead of congratulating on my promotion...
-Oh, sorry. -No, you want to talk about men.
Oh sorry, darling. Congratulations, sweetie! I'm so proud of you!
Better person!
Congrats, but leave work for now.
Give us more gist about him now.
Get it!
Well, if you must know, we're having dinner tonight.
-[gasps] -Ooh! -That guy is a sharp guy. I like him. -[laughs]
No time to waste.
-That was quick, right? -Yes. At this age? Ugh, no time to play around anymore.
At this age? Ugh, no time to play around anymore.
I suppose. So, what are you gonna wear?
More importantly, what are you gonna do about this, your hair?
-My hair? -Yes.
-What's wrong with my hair? -A lot!
Don't be going all team natural on this one, oh.
Girl, give him some glam, you know? -[clears throat] -See, bouncy!
-[clears throat] -See, bouncy! I agree.
Something... softer, you know, a bit more... feminine... won't be bad.
What are you guys saying? My hair is glam and feminine.
-Babe, that's so not true. -Girl...
-It's your first date with him. -And?
You've just got to go super glam
with your makeup and dressing.
-[laughs] -The guy won't know what hit him.
-Agnes on fire! -I promise you, girl!
But that's not me.
Darling, no one expects to see the real you on the first date.
Come, don't look at me like that.
Nobody expects to see the real you until you get married.
-[laughs] -Please, I'm just gonna keep it real.
Dear, the competition out there is very tight.
Girls ain't smiling.
So you cannot smile.
-You can't smile either. -Calm yourself.
Hey.
You look more beautiful than I remember.
Oh, thank you. I thought I'd make an effort.
-I'm glad you did. -[laughs]
Thank you!
So the next week, I was on a plane to Lagos.
Really? So you just up and left everything?
Weren't you scared?
I mean, I've been noticing the changes around here for a while.
To be honest, I've been really lucky.
My parents introduced me to a few people who went on to invest in a company.
I've been back here for nine, ten months,
and I've raised over three million dollars.
Things have been really good, I can't complain.
So tell me, how come a gorgeous woman like you is still single?
I don't know. How do you even answer that question?
Maybe you've been too busy building a career, you forgot to date.
Is that what happened to you?
[chuckles] Sort of. You know, I've not had a relationship since post grad.
Really? And why is that?
You see, honestly, I've not been a very good boyfriend.
Relationships take a lot of work,
and I wasn't ready to make that time or commit to doing the work.
And what about now?
I mean, I'm back here now.
My business is doing good.
Getting married is the next step for me.
So on a scale of 1 to 10, what are my chances of getting a second date?
Well...
Really? That bad? You had to think about it?
You have to give a girl a chance to front some more now.
There's no need to front, all right?
I'm a hundred percent hooked.
After you.
Thank you.
-Hi. -Oh, hello.
Don't freak out,
but you left this in the dryer.
That's not mine.
It's not that bad. I mean, at least they're clean... and cute.
I mean, at least they're clean... and cute.
I mean, not that I was checking them out... I mean,
I would never check out a stranger's underpants.
They were just in the dryer, and I thought...
I'm making this worse, aren't I? You are. Um... you know what? I'm just gonna go, yeah?
You are. Um... you know what? I'm just gonna go, yeah?
Yeah, sorry.
Hey, girlfriend!
You'll never believe what just happened.
I was just standing on my own at the laundromat, folding my clothes,
and then this white guy just walks up to me,
and I'm like smiling, feeling my Sunday swag,
thinking he wanted to come ask me out.
Guess what this guy had to say? "You left your underpants in the dryer!"
[shrieks] I just wanted the floor to open up and swallow me whole!
Can you imagine?
Oh my God! You know what?
It's such a shame 'cause he was kinda cute.
You know, like... as in...
So when you say "kind of cute", is that like cute enough to--
How much of that did you... How much of my conversation did you hear?
I wanted to stop listening. It was an accident.
I just couldn't help myself.
Let me call you back.
Really?
Hey, I think you're cute too!
[Isoken] I know, but it's really not their fault.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
We all know that when they came into the market, right,
the naira was really strong and obviously they were the brand to beat, but...
the naira was really strong and obviously they were the brand to beat, but... who ever thought that the naira would be 300 to a dollar? Huh?
That is exactly what you get
when you have stupid and, frankly speaking, irresponsible leaders!
when you have stupid and, frankly speaking, irresponsible leaders! -Thank you very much. -It's so terrible.
-Thank you very much. -It's so terrible.
[grunts] It's a shame.
Jesus Christ!
Let me see your leg.
I bind every spirit,
every enemy against your downfall!
May they fall down and die! May they die by fire! May they die by fire! Die by fire!
In the next three to five years, the landscape is going to be very different.
So that's why I'm considering getting an executive MBA,
-maybe from Yale or Columbia or something. -Yes.
Which one is an MBA again?
You, this girl,
I said which one is an MBA again?
Instead of coming to help out in the kitchen,
you're sitting here talking all over the place.
Will an MBA find you a husband?
Or are they handing out children at the universities now?
A woman should not read too much!
Girls of nowadays... they want to behave like men.
But God created you to build a home, to build a home!
But you want to act like men?
Then how do you find a husband? Who becomes the head of the family?
How?
Isoken's mother... Why would you say these things?
What? What!
But you people know me now.
I say things the way they are. You know me.
That is the duty of a mother.
Isoken, don't mind your mother, you hear me?
Me, that's how I like my girls.
I like them independent.
I like them intelligent.
And I like them ambitious!
You, my own brother,
that has not brought home a wife at the age of 45.
Hey, leave Mike alone, please.
Isoken, darling,
how did your date with Osaze go?
It went very well, Auntie.
You know, I actually just got a message from work. I'm gonna have to leave.
On a Sunday? -Yeah, I'm so sorry. -You see?
Come on, you haven't even eaten. Put something in your stomach, girl.
You see? If I talk now, they'll say, Ye-Isoken, Ye-Isoken, Ye-Isoken!
-Sister... -Work, work, work, work...
You're too harsh on her.
[scoffs] She can't even spend time with her own family.
Work...
[Mike] Leave the girl.
Am I holding her?
-Leave her. -I'm not holding her.
What is it? Marry, marry, marry, -marry, marry! -Is she married?
-marry, marry! -Is she married?
-[chuckling] -That's her problem.
[in Pidgin] Which one of them is marrying?
Someone's looking mighty nice today.
Top, skirt coordinating, hair on fleek.
Thank you. It's going to be a good day today.
♪ Be patient ♪
So I went ahead to set up a meeting with the photographer,
the one the MD recommended for the campaign for next week Friday.
Isoken? Isoken?
I heard you... Meeting, MD, photographer, when?
I heard you... Meeting, MD, photographer, when? Friday.
And I spoke to the suppliers to make inquiries about the...
And I spoke to the suppliers to make inquiries about the... -[song crescendos] -[dialogue fades into background]
No, wait, wait, so you don't think she's right?
-No, I think that... -Wait,
you just think about how many single men you met in your early twenties...
and now when you go to a party,
all the men there are either married, engaged or gay.
Some are even married and gay!
The other day, I went to this party, and all the men there came with their wives,
except for this one guy, who had like ten girls giving him attention.
The guy was feeling like he was the hottest guy there.
Meanwhile, he's not even handsome! Never, ever! Me, Agnes, I don't consider guys that are not hot
Never, ever! Me, Agnes, I don't consider guys that are not hot
-because... -[grunts] -She knows that. -Whether he's hot or ugly,
-She knows that. -Whether he's hot or ugly,
he'll still cheat with a 21-year-old girl!
-Sending her text messages! -Oh well...
Or cheat on me with some Instagram twerker.
So, if I'm going to be dealing with such drama,
I better wake up next to you and think,
"Damn, this bro is hot!"
Agnes! Don't kill me! Hey!
OK guys, wait.
My Seye, he's not cheating on me?
-Oh, oh, no... -No. Nuh-uh.
Cheat? Where? No. Don't mind her. Don't mind Agnes, oh!
Look, there are lots of good men out there.
It's not your fault that she keeps picking shitty ones.
I was just sipping on my drink. I almost choked.
-Yeah, yeah. I can see why. -You're wicked, you're wicked.
-Don't mind her. -Seriously, guys.
Really, there's got to be some good guys out there.
Because me, this year...

Oh, stop!
Look, this Isoken that's singing with you, she has left you behind.
At least, there was a date that led to a kiss that led to flowers!
that led to a kiss that led to flowers!
that led to a kiss that led to flowers! Backtrack, back... Isoken, you didn't tell me there was a kiss.
Backtrack, back... Isoken, you didn't tell me there was a kiss.
Look! You should be more interested in what this card says, girl.
[Isoken] Oh, nothing...
Just how he would like to have me over for dinner at his.
-Ooh, fancy! -Look at you playing all cool
like she's not bursting with excitement!
[Isoken] I'm bursting! I can't even lie!
I was in the middle of a big meeting,
and all I could do was just smile!
I'm sure people were looking at me like, "This girl has lost it. She's crazy." -Aw, so cute. -She can't help it!
-Aw, so cute. -She can't help it!
-Cute! -Calm down!
Isoken, so when last did you wax your area?
Good question.
Um, I don't know, maybe about a year ago.
What?
I've not had any action down there for two years!
You know me, and that waxing thing is way too painful,
so for me, I say, "No gain, no pain."
Girl, you are a disgrace.
-Yes! -Yes!
-Leave me alone! -[grunts]
There's no need anyway because nobody's getting naked, so...
-Oh, really? -Oh, tell me.
-He's cooking for you... -Yes?
-...in his house... at night... -Yes?
Yes?
Hello? Classic guy move?
Yep.
Something's gonna go down...
That didn't occur to me.
Really? Madam kiss on the first date, it didn't occur?
Are you like..
Look, I'm about to book you a spa appointment right now.
No, thank you!
No? After two years, Isoken?
Girls, if it was me, [moans] I would be horny even in spirit!
-[laughing] -That's like spiritual! She said in spirit! I'm telling you!
Isoken, are you sure you can handle it?
I think I can handle it.

Hm, OK, so what do we have here?
Nah, I don't like it.
This one, yes.
Right.
Oh, am I early?
No, no, come in.
OK, thank you.
I just got out of the kitchen.
I would've hugged you, but I'm a mess, and you look very beautiful.
Thank you. This is for you.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
Come in.
-[exhales] So, sit. -OK.
Here's the remote.
Thank you.
Just give me a few minutes, let me, um, fix this up. I'll be right back.
All right.
So did you find anything incriminating?
Could I have found anything incriminating?
Oh, you agree, you were snooping.
But of course. What grown woman wouldn't?
All I need now is the password to your phone.
Your apartment... um, it's very...
Very...
Um, I'm trying to find the word, um... I know, man cave-y.
What's that?
Like it was purely designed for the slaying of women.
No women, OK? Just you.
Really?
Yeah, let me get, um, the food before it gets cold, all right?
OK, do you need any help?
Nah, it's all right. Beautiful women should be waited on.
-Sure? -Of course.
OK.
Oh my God, for the next three days,
I shouldn't be allowed to eat any food after what you fed me. What?
What can I say? I aim to please.
It was so good.
So, don't you think the chef deserves a kiss?
Oh no! The power company! Come on!
These guys want to kill my swag but no!
You know, I actually saw this coming.
Hm, I'm sure you did because it's happened a million times, right?
Come on. Give the brother some credit.
I wouldn't have gone through all this trouble
if I didn't think there was something here.
And is there something here?
-[grunts] -Sorry, was I... No, look. Sorry, it's me.
No, look. Sorry, it's me.
As you can tell, I'm very attracted to you.
Oh, I am attracted to you, too.
Well, I guess what I'm trying to say is
I think we should just take it a little slower, if that's OK.
Are you sure you don't want some more wine?
Saze, are you trying to get me drunk?
No! Never! Come on.
You're very dangerous, you, this man.
No, little old me?
You know what? I think you're right.
That you're dangerous?
No. That we should take things slow.
Look, Isoken, I think you're really special, and I'm happy to wait.
Oh my God, could you be any hotter?
What?
Nothing.
Yeah, of course. Now you just want to rip my shirt off, don't you?
What are you feeling like?
Hi there, I was told you are available.
You!
Do I know you?
Oh my God, it's you with the pink thong!
Oh, come on, don't be ridiculous.
You literally just spoke to me; you can't hide!
What are you doing in my office?
We're supposed to have a meeting.
You're the one that the MD wants for the campaign?
Yup, that would be me.
Yup, that would be me. Ugh, just my luck.
You do know what this means, right?
Uh, I have to avoid you like the plague
because you obviously have some kind of weird magic
that makes me make a fool of myself around you.
Well, let's see. First of all, I see your underpants,
Well, let's see. First of all, I see your underpants, and now you just took your wig off in front of me.
You probably just farted.
-Too far? -You think?
Yeah, sorry.
I'm Kevin.
Isoken.
Ee-so-ken.
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Ah, you have Bem Yoda's CD.
What do you know about him?
I'm a true Lagos boy!
That was bad, wasn't it? Terrible.
He's a friend of mine. I'm a big fan of his.
-Really? -Yeah.
You do know he's playing at The Hole tonight?
Yeah, my friend Kuku and I are actually going.
-Really? -Yeah...
Nice. I'll be there.
I'll be the "white guy" in a really cool Ankara shirt.
[inhales] OK, cool. All right, why don't you have a seat?
-Shall we? -The reason why we're here... Mm-hm.
OK, so I've been looking at the slides, and you're really, really good,
-you have a great eye. -[slow, lighthearted music playing] Oh, thank you. These are the new bunch.
Oh, thank you. These are the new bunch. Yeah.
All right. Thanks a lot, guys.
Heading home now. Do you need me to do anything else?
-Um, no, I'm good, thanks. -All right.
So I forgot to ask,
are we still going with the photographer from earlier for the campaign?
Oh, no we're not. He doesn't do that kind of work.
What sort of work does he do?
He's actually a photojournalist with the Associated Press,
so I think there's a bit of a clash there, so...
You know Ifeanyi is crazy about you, right?
Ugh! Which one is "ugh"?
He's so boring. Really? He seems like a nice guy.
Really? He seems like a nice guy.
His ringtone is "Somebody Shout Hallelujah!" Uh-huh. And?
That boy can do anything for you.
Really? When his phone rings, the entire place turns around like...
I mean, I love God too but please chill.
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were alone. I'll come back.
Oh no, no, come back, come in!
She's on her way out.
-Good night. -Good night!
Good night.
Hey sweetie, is everything OK?
Come and sit down, please.
What is it? Sit... Sit... Sit.
So what's the matter? What's wrong?
I'm sorry, I'm OK.
It's me, Joke. What is it?
Did the test come back negative again?
-[whimpers] -I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
Sorry.
It was positive.
What?
I'm pregnant.
Oh my God!
What's the matter? Why aren't... Why aren't you happy?
Why are you crying then?
I can't go through it again. I just,
I can't bear to keep hoping, and every time...
Four times, Isoken.
I lost my babies four times.
Oh my God, I didn't know. I didn't know.
We didn't tell you. I didn't even tell my mum.
We were not even planning. I know I'm going to lose it again.
We were not even planning. I know I'm going to lose it again. No! No...
I know it always happens! No, no, no, you won't.
No, no, no, you won't. This one will stay, I promise.
This one will stay, I promise.
You have to be positive, OK?
-[Joke sobs] -Don't worry...
I know, I know. But you have to stay positive. You have to be strong.
Hey, Kukua.
Move! Can't you see it's yellow? Move!
Shoo!
Love your size! Let me take care of you, help you calm down.
Bug off!
What? The impudence! We're looking for husbands not peasants!
Nonsense.
-[tires screech] -[man] Whoa!
Kukua, is that you?
Isoken, sorry, oh, it's... Are you ready?
Ready for what? The open mic thing. You said I should pick you up.
The open mic thing. You said I should pick you up.
Oh my God, I forgot. OK, don't worry,
just come. I'll be ready when you get here.
just come. I'll be ready when you get here. I'm coming.
All right, honey. OK, bye!
Thank you.
You know, I've been a fan of yours for a while now.
Really?
-Really. -Thank you.
It's really great to catch you live.
I hope you liked it. I sure did.
-So how do you know this guy? -Oh well it's a very funny story actually.
And I'll have to kill you if you tell it because it's that embarrassing.
if you tell it because it's that embarrassing. Now, I really want to hear it.
Chuks and I are leaving.
-Who? -Chuks!
But you just met him ten seconds ago. And he's taking me to his friend's party.
Don't worry, I'm not a serial killer or anything.
Right, Kevin?
He's OK.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. She's in safe hands.
-Look, don't you dare ruin my plans. -And how am I supposed to get home?
Oh, I can drop you off.
Oh, thank you so much for not abandoning me, unlike some people.
Listen, that guilt trip is not going to work on me.
I told you: this year, I'm getting married.
Now watch me work my magic.
Just take it easy.
[shouts] Just take me to the altar already!
Oh no, he's gonna try and extort money from you.
It's OK, I've got this covered.
Good evening, sir.
Good evening, white man... welcome.
How's your day? Good evening, madam. -Good evening, sir. -Welcome.
-Good evening, sir. -Welcome. Thank you.
Why are you just looking at me? Don't you have anything for us?
Oh, no... Don't have anything today but well done!
What am I supposed to do with that? Just get lost! Look at him, taking a woman around with no money!
Look at him, taking a woman around with no money!
-Just leave! -You're truly a local!
Man, I was so drunk, eh.
I don't know how they got me to the altar the next day.
They had us waiting at the church for nearly two hours!
Look, it's the best man's job to make sure the groom
Look, it's the best man's job to make sure the groom has the best night he's ever had before he signs away his life.
has the best night he's ever had before he signs away his life.
Oh, really?
Someone's in trouble.
No, come on, but babe, you know what I mean,
it's before he signs on for the greatest experience
[all the men together] of his life.
So, that's exactly what you were saying.
Look, look, look, as a great best man,
Look, look, look, as a great best man, I had to make sure I get him down that aisle.
No one ever said anything about him being on time or being late, but the most important thing is that he made it.
but the most important thing is that he made it.
-Didn't you make it? -Barely.
My dad was livid. The vicar almost sent us back.
When are you two gonna need a best man?
Uh... I don't know about that.
I think we should just allow these ladies bond a bit.
Ah, no that's an escape strategy! No!
Don't you ladies need to compare notes on wedding outfits or something?
Oh, so because we're women, automatically, we would have to talk about wedding outfits?
We have a feminist here. Isaac, grab that bottle.
Yeah, good idea.
So you're helping your guy escape, right? No, baby...
Hello.
So I was cleaning my car earlier, and guess what I found?
Hm, what did you find? Let me guess, a 100 naira note?
Hm, what did you find? Let me guess, a 100 naira note? Wasn't even a thousand nairas.
Ah, me I wouldn't leave one thousand naira in the car, never!
But you did forget your earring though.
I didn't realize that they were missing.
I think you left it here on purpose
knowing that I would find it and then call you.
Well, aren't you confident?
Well, it worked.
Oh by the way, my friend Chuks is in love with your friend Kukua.
I know, the way he was looking at her that night, I thought he was going to swallow her.
I think he wants to do that, too.
[chuckles] Kevin, you can pretend like you're innocent, but that's a lie.
Ey, dey no form oh.
I no form...
do for... I give up.
Please just give up. Don't worry, I'll teach you.
Well, maybe I can come around tomorrow night for some lessons...
and to give you back your earring, of course.
Oh, OK.
OK. Well, I'll see you then.
-Good night, Isoken. -Good night, Kevin.
OK, so I put the palm oil in, and now, the thing is turning green.
No, I bought the regular starch from the store,
isn't that what you said?
Wait, let me see.
[clears throat] OK, wait now, I'm reading it!
Mix starch with cold water. While stirring, pour in hot water...
Caution: do not use as food?
[laughs] Well, how was I supposed to know that some of them turn blue and are not supposed to... [chuckles]
that some of them turn blue and are not supposed to... [chuckles]
Oh my gosh. OK, OK, so what do we do now?
-[doorbell rings] -[screams] Ah! Oh, jeez, you know what?
Ah! Oh, jeez, you know what?
No, no, no, it's fine. It's fine. Someone's at my door.
You know what? I'll call you back. I'll call you back. OK, bye.
OK... [groans]
Oh, Kevin.
Oh, right...
You were expecting me, right?
Sorry, I forgot. OK, just come in, come in...
Oh my God, fire!
What are you doing? I'm trying to kill it!
With your hands? Where's your extinguisher?
It's in there. It's in there!
Did you get it? Yeah! It's done!
Yeah! It's done!
-Well, hello there. -Hey!
-Hey. -You've got really good taste in music.
Aw, thank you. I get that from my dad.
You know, I think if he hadn't gotten married and had us kids,
he probably would have played the sax professionally.
He still talks about the time he used to jam with Fela.
No way. I love Fela! Dude, that's my claim to fame! I tell everyone that he was my uncle.
Dude, that's my claim to fame! I tell everyone that he was my uncle.
No way. Yeah, uh, after all I'm Nigerian,
Yeah, uh, after all I'm Nigerian,
and everyone who is a friend of your parents is your uncle.
-Famzer! -[laughs]
Are you sure you're not Nigerian?
You must have bleached your skin or something.
Oh my God, you've got Shina Peters! Yes, what do you know about Shina Peters, white boy?
Yes, what do you know about Shina Peters, white boy?
I'll have you know my nickname used to be oyibo afro juju.
Never! Why would they call you that?
The kids of the Nigerians
who worked at the High Commission -used to have birthday parties. -OK.
-used to have birthday parties. -OK. Every time, without fail, they used to play Shina Peters
Every time, without fail, they used to play Shina Peters
and have these dance competitions.
I don't know how, but I just kept winning every time.
-[laughs] -I think they felt sorry for me.
-Oh wow, really? You kept winning? -Yeah.
Oh, I have to see this then. Excuse me.
What? What are you doing?
I want you to dance for me. I want you to show me the moves.
-You want me to dance for you? -Yeah!
Is it every day you see oyibo afro juju?
So please. Fine, fine. But prepare to be amazed.
Fine, fine. But prepare to be amazed.
Take it away.
Huh? OK, what is, what is that?
No, no, no. Kevin, you really have to stop!
Oh, you can't stop this. You can't stop these moves, no.
Oh, you can't stop this. You can't stop these moves, no. Please, please, please...
And then she said, "Are they sharing children in the university?"
No, she didn't.
Yes, she did. My mother...
So it doesn't matter what a woman accomplishes in her life.
She could find a cure for AIDS,
she could find a cure for world hunger, even cancer,
and it still wouldn't matter
unless she was able to bag herself a husband and pop out some babies.
I know what you mean.
I know what you mean. The pressure here to get married is massive.
How you're perceived is so important.
I remember, in university, we had a friend,
she got married right out of university and then had a child shortly after.
She must've been like, what, 22 years old?
And then while we were out clubbing and having boyfriends
and just being kids, she was at home changing diapers.
So I bet she must have felt like a pariah.
Eventually, more and more friends started pairing off
and getting married and having their own children and...
before you know it, it just hits you, at 34, you're the only single woman at your school's reunion.
at 34, you're the only single woman at your school's reunion.
It's like one minute, you're a star student,
and then the next minute, you feel like you failed at some life exams.
Wow, oh my goodness! Is that the time? Oh wow.
-Sorry... -Yeah...
I didn't mean to keep you up. No, it's OK. It's fine.
I thoroughly enjoyed myself.
I did too, actually.
That's good. Well, thank you for the earring and your terrible dance moves.
You're welcome. Hey, listen, I just wanted to say,
you have nothing to worry about.
You are an incredibly beautiful woman,
and you will find love... in your own time.
-[sentimental music playing] -I hope so. Thanks, Kevin.
You're welcome.
-OK, good night. -Good night.
Are you ready?
[Isoken] This waxing thing, I'm not sure it's worth the pain.
I don't know about you, but it is working for me.
Chuks cannot get enough of me!
-So you like it when he does that? -Like it? Girl, I love it...
Oh please, I beg, enough of this gist.
I can't believe I'm the only one here without a man.
-Like seriously? -Speak for yourself.
Some people even have two.
-What? -Mm-hm.
Yeah, a white boy.
Agnes!
OK, guys, I'm sorry, but...
I don't know how to feel about Nigerian girls that date white guys.
It just comes off as, I don't know, like there's an inferiority complex.
I'm sorry.
I feel you. My cousin calls it the post-colonial blues.
I mean, the way we Africans think everything white is better...
That's why we struggle with all these foreign accents.
Exactly!
Please, Joke calm down. What is it?
If you felt that strongly, why did you go to school in England?
Please ask her!
Besides, having light skinned, half-caste kids won't be bad at all, you know?
You see what I mean? And by the way, it's mixed race.
You see what I mean? And by the way, it's mixed race. -Mixed race. -Whatever.
-Mixed race. -Whatever. You guys just relax, OK?
I'm not dating him. We're just friends. Besides if I was, you guys are terrible.
So, so wait, wait, wait, you're saying you do not like him?
[sighs] I don't know...
You know, if there ever was a checklist of what a great guy would be,
Saze would tick every box.
-Ah, ah, one person! -Oh.
-Handsome, check. -Great.
Successful, check. Ambitious, check.
-Great kisser, check, check, check, check! -Really?
So wetin you come dey find again, girl?
I know, but Kevin...
-[sighs loudly] -I just feel like I can be myself.
No need to pretend or try to be someone else.
Maybe because there's no pressure to be perfect around him.
Maybe because there's no pressure to be perfect around him. No. Wait, wait, listen. Look at me, girl.
No. Wait, wait, listen. Look at me, girl.
All these butterflies you're feeling for Kevin...
[smacks lips] Will butterflies pay bills?
Answer!
Look, Saze is the real deal.
Saze knows what he wants, you know,
knows where he's going in life, and it aligns with yours, right?
I guess...
Your marriage should be a union of two great Edo families.
The wedding outfits will look great.
I can imagine Flavor and Olamide performing at the wedding!
-Babes, what else do you what? -Agnes!
Weddings are not concerts!
Exactly! And marriages are not business mergers.
But wait, wait, who says you have to decide now?
You can date both of them. Men have done worse.
You can date both of them. Men have done worse. But isn't it cheating?
No, no, no, no, no!
So long as you're not sleeping with Kevin as well, it's dating.
-Mm. -There's a difference.
Really?
Isoken, I'm sure you know your mum would flip when she hears this.
-Oh please, please... -I beg, please,
enjoy your life! Do it for all the girls around the world!
I see you want to live vicariously through me, right?
Listen, if I had my own way, I would even date five!
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday... -Kukua! -Girls, they hustle!
-Kukua! -Girls, they hustle!
-Kukua! -Believe me, you should be there!
♪ I don't even know If I take your breath away ♪ -Just saying. -Yeah, it's really cool, just to be out.
Well, if my truck isn't gonna get us into the market,
we're gonna have to use one of these. What? You this white boy! Don't get me lost in Lagos!
What? You this white boy! Don't get me lost in Lagos!
I've never ridden one of these.

Add more, add more, it's for your daddy.
My dear, pass me a napkin, please.
Sis, are you sure you don't need help?
So I heard you raised three million dollars for your company.
Oh, yeah.
So you see, I'm into oil and gas as well.
[in Igbo] What did you say?
Oil and what? No, Mummy, he means OYEL.
Is it not so OYEL?
What now? Can't a young man expand his hustle?
It's all right. You can come see me anytime.
Isoken's family is my family.
Speaking of family...
I am assuming that those are your intentions towards my daughter.
Father...
Are we really going to have the discussion on intentions? Really?
Is it too soon to ask?
Or doesn't the young man have a plan?
Yes, sir, I do.
I was raised by highly ambitious and hardworking parents
who taught us to go after whatever we want in life.
And I recognize those same ambitions in Isoken.
That's what I'm most attracted to in her.
So I believe I can build a great future with Isoken behind me.
More chicken anyone? There's still a bit here.
Oh, nice. They got some new stuff.
That reminds me of Oshuti.
-You've got a good eye. -Mm-hm, I know.

Hm. What I'm getting is lover's embrace.

Absolutely not!
Why not?
I'm turning 35! Thirty-five!
I remember when I was 18, and now, I'm gonna be 35.
So I don't need any more reminders that I'm five away from 40, OK?
I already have this to deal with and then I have these bags under...

-You're beautiful. -Look. It's terrible, like...

Surprise!
Happy birthday!

Hey, um, I just wanted to know
Hey, um, I just wanted to know if you, like, wanted anything to drink, like juice or something?
if you, like, wanted anything to drink, like juice or something?
Ifeanyi, leave me alone, please.
Can't you see I'm busy?
Look, I feel like I need an extra two hours of sleep
because soon I'll be a zombie.
Yes, so my brother, enjoy it while it lasts.
I love my little man, but sometimes I just want
to grab him and shake him and ask him what is really wrong.
-Aw. -No, no, don't do that.
Yeah, I can't wait.
My nose is expanding by the day
and everyone lied about that pregnancy glow.
-Baby, you lied. -Baby, come on...
Have you seen the video that Osato and her husband sent you?
Oh no, I haven't! Aw!
It's so cute. I mean they wanted to Skype, but you know it's 3:00 a.m. their time.
It's so cute. I mean they wanted to Skype, but you know it's 3:00 a.m. their time. I know, the time difference...

Hello... Hi...
-Having a good time? -Happy birthday, darling.
Thank you, honey.
Daddy!
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
Thank you, thank you, Daddy.
You always give the best presents every year.
Let me tell you a secret: you're my favorite.
I already knew that. I won't tell anyone.
Sorry, I didn't realize there was a party.
No, she didn't know. It was all last minute, um...
[inaudible] I'm sorry.
[inaudible] It's OK.
Come in?
Excuse me, everyone! Excuse me!
Can I have your attention please?
[woman] What's going on?
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
I know we've only known each other for six months now,
but I couldn't have asked to meet a more perfect woman for me
at a most perfect time in my life.
I know where I want my life to go and the things I want to accomplish,
and you're the woman I want behind me.
-Please say you'll marry me? -[crowd gasps]
-Oh, my God! Oh my God... -[indistinct chatter]
-Is that a yes? -[woman] Yes!
[man] Say yes!
-Yes. -Yes.
Yes!
Glory! Glory!
Tell her I said happy birthday.
-[man 1] Congratulations. -[man 2] Congrats, my man.
Congratulations, man. You've done it.
-[man 1] That was smooth. -[man 2] Welcome to the club.
Now listen, this is what we call a ring.
Coming to bed?
Oh yes, I just wanted to, you know,
get a look at some of the presents before coming to bed.
OK.
I'll be right there.
I didn't hear about the engagement.
Really? Since three months,
I've been running up and down trying to organize this wedding.
It's been so stressful.
Congratulations, my dear. Ah, so who is the lucky man?
Thank you, Auntie. His name is Osaze...
Abieyuwa.
I think I know the Abieyuwa family.
Ah, they are from a good home.
And such a well-brought-up boy.
His business is doing fabulous.
God answers prayers, oh!
Yes, oh! He didn't allow my enemies to laugh at me.
In fact, Reverend Adeniji himself will be joining them.
-Really? -Yes.
My dear, take a look at these fabrics.
These were the ones we were talking about.
These designs are common.
I don't want common designs.
I'll have over 1,000 people at that wedding,
and I don't want anybody wearing any design remotely resembling mine.
I even heard Mama Osaze ordered her own fabrics from Switzerland.
-From Switzerland? -So, yes, me.
‎I don't want to be disgraced.
-[laughs] -I trust you will not be disgraced my dear, don't worry.
you will not be disgraced my dear, don't worry.
I'm going to give you something from that same Switzerland. Ronke!
[Saze's mother] My dressmaker is expecting you to come in for your measurement. [chuckles]
Already she has bought the fabric from Paris.
All you need to do is go into her studio in Ikoyi to meet her.
But excuse me, I already have a dress, Ma.
-Your wedding dress? -Yes, Ma.
Who?
There's a lady who makes clothes for my mum,
-and she made my sister's wedding dress. -[chuckles]
You can use that one later, at the reception.
Joyce is the best.
She's so busy that usually people book her up to six months in advance.
In fact, she's making the president's daughter's dress as well.
I had to pay through my nose,
but if that's what we need to do to get the best, then we must.
Or what do you think Saze?
Hm? Yeah, whatever you want, Mum.
And this hair, it just won't do.
You look like a...
how can I put this nicely... like a rural girl.
Men and their mothers.
Look, there's really not much you can do about it.
So it's totally OK that he just sat there and watched his mum
So it's totally OK that he just sat there and watched his mum tell me what I'm going to wear to my own wedding?
Like, he didn't even stand up to her!
Isoken! He probably didn't just want to get involved.
Isoken! He probably didn't just want to get involved. Hm? Have you seen his mother?
Hm? Have you seen his mother?
That woman is intimidating.
Maybe it's just pre-wedding jitters. Everybody gets it, right?
-Right? -Mm, yeah...
Anyway... Oh my God!
You look beautiful!
That's an understatement!
-[grunts] -Are you sure? This is nice.
This is nice. I love it.
Are you sure it's not too much?
Isoken! Isoken, don't start, oh!
It's a wedding dress. It's supposed to make a statement!
Wait, let me see.
I don't know, I just feel like it's not very me.
-[Isoken] You know? -It's you.
I think... [gasps]
-Is that what I think it is? -The baby's coming.
-Oh my God! OK, OK... -[groans in pain]

-I know... -See how Seye's mum is staring at me.
I'm sure she's thinking, "Look at this single girl,
baring her chest anyhow.
Don't corrupt my daughter-in-law."
What do expect when you have all your girls out?
-OK. -You know she goes to MFM?
She will send you for deliverance.

I didn't think he would come with Kevin!

I've been so angry lately...
angry at you,
angry at me.
I just wanted to get past this,
but every time I tried, I just kept thinking about you
and all the things I love about you.
Like how passionate you are, and stubborn,
but at the same time, kind of goofy and awkward,
and you do this really cute thing with your chin when you smile.
What I'm trying to say is...
don't marry him.
Don't...
because I love you.
And I know you love me too.
So choose us.
How are you?
Fine.
Are you sure about that?
Daddy,
[sighs] this wedding planning is just stressing me out.
So take it easy now, hm? Take it easy.
Daddy, I have a difficult decision to make.
You know, since you've been a little child,
you've always taken it upon yourself
to ensure everybody else is happy,
often to the detriment of your own happiness, hm?
Hey, hey, hey...
Listen, listen, listen. Listen, Isoken,
it's not your duty to make everybody happy.
You don't have to take a decision that will make you miserable just because you want to please anybody,
that will make you miserable just because you want to please anybody,
not me, not even your mother.
Nobody should put you under such pressure, hm?

OK, go get the hair stylist.
Agnes. Yes, love.
Could you please get Saze to come up to meet me here?
For what? Why?
Isoken, it's your pre-wedding dinner.
Everyone is waiting. We're late already.
If you want time alone with Saze, why don't you wait till later tonight?

What are you saying? You're not making any sense.
Saze, everything with us happened so quickly!
One minute, we're just getting to know each other,

I'm just thinking to myself the whole time
that why does this feel like this?
Why do I feel like a guest at my own wedding?
I'm supposed to be so much happier than this!
Is this about my mum? I know she can be a handful...
No, it's not about your mum; it's not about mine.
Saze, it just doesn't feel right.

I never even got a chance to say yes.
Wait, this is... this is about that guy, isn't it?

I love Tega, and I would kill for my children
but sometimes, I wish...
Like I wish I had just told them that I wasn't ready, you know?
Or I just told them that I needed a little bit more time.
I don't know what I'm doing, Isoken.
And between the school runs and taking care of Tega,
there's no more time for me.
I don't know who I am anymore.
Aw, don't say that, baby sis.
I know who you are.
-You're an amazing mother and wife, Reme. -[scoffs]
You're passionate and kind and beautiful...
-Yeah. -...and smart.
-Keep going. -[laughs]
You're only 28, love. You have the whole world ahead of you.
Wait, I just wish I could press the reset button, you know?
But you don't need a reset button, sis.
All you have to do is just take it one day at a time.
Yeah. I love you.
Yeah. I love you. I love you too.
[exhales] Speaking of which,
I think I'm ready for that family intervention right now.
-Are you sure? -Yeah.
Cause I could just tell them that you were sleeping when I got here.
Nah, nah, let's do this. I'm ready for them. What?
Nah, nah, let's do this. I'm ready for them. What? OK...
Bring it, man! Let me just...
I'm gonna drive, OK?
-Yeah, wise baby sister. -[laughs]
Wise.
When I say let me pray for you,
you'll be running away. You see?
How can a 35-year-old woman
break up her own engagement?
Auntie Isoken, you didn't do well.
You should've at least allowed me to collect some millions from that guy before you broke up with him.
What's wrong with you? What?
Sister! Mama Isoken!
You are sitting down there.
Won't you let us go and beg the King of Kings,
God of Gods so that this child... Wait... please!
Wait... please!
Isoken,
-are you gay? -What?
Yes!
I have been sitting here cracking my head.
The last time you had a boyfriend was when you were 28.
Before then, you brought home only two.
Now, by yourself,
you have gone ahead and told your Saze you can't marry him,
a man like that!
It means you don't want to marry anybody else!
Mum, she's not gay. She likes somebody else.
-Really? -What's wrong with you?
Who?
His name is Kevin. He's English.
What is wrong with this girl? Don't we all speak English?
Exactly.
-He's white. -What?
-White? -Yes.
I know this girl is going to disgrace me!
This girl has disgraced me!
I knew it! I knew it!
Isoken, why can you not be normal like your sisters?
Why can you not be normal?
Are you the only one who went to school in England?
Enough, Mummy, enough!
I nearly married Saze,
who would have made me miserable,
just because I wanted to please you.
So that maybe just for once, for once in my life, I can say I finally did something to make Mummy happy,
for once in my life, I can say I finally did something to make Mummy happy,
to make you proud of me.
But I know now that will never happen...
unless I do exactly what you want me to do,
and that's not gonna happen.
Because you know what?
I'm not normal.
What?
I never was, and I never will be.
So the earlier you start to accept that, Mummy, the better!
And lest I forget,
I'm gonna tell Kevin that I love him
and that I want to be with him.
So if you ever want to see your grandchildren,
you better get on board.
Isoken, Isoken! It's OK, it's OK.
Reme, I'm going to need a ride.
Hey, don't worry, don't worry.
I will take you myself.
I'm coming along!
-Mike! -What?
You can sit if you want to.
Aren't you coming?
-Auntie Stella? You too? -Mm-hm.
Wow! Come on, let's go.
Belt up!
What?
What is it?
-[mumbling] -OK, Isoken, move to the back.
My love, my love!
[flatters] Ye-Isoken!
Hi.
Didn't expect to see you here.
I know. Can we go over there and get some privacy, please?
Yeah, sure. Mind your head.
So, how have you been?
I've been good. How have you been?
Yeah, I've been OK.
OK, so, um...
I know it's probably not gonna make much of a difference,
especially since you're leaving tomorrow and everything, but...
I just wanted to tell you that I love you, Kevin,
and I'm sorry that it's taken me so long to tell you this,
but I love you, and I choose you. I choose us.
[MC] Mr. Groom, please do not swallow the bride!
Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,
please give it up for the couple of the year, Kukua and Chuks! Make some noise!
Kukua and Chuks! Make some noise!
Hold on, can I get some grilled fish and plantain instead?
But you said you wanted rice. Reme, I saw them serving fish,
Reme, I saw them serving fish,
it looked nice, so I changed my mind like...
[scoffs] You know what?
You can go ahead and get the fish yourself,
and by the way, I'm going back to work!
Stop running!
-Hey. -Hi, can I get you something?
Um, actually... Actually, I have that sorted already.
Hey, hi. Um... Uh...
Yinka, this is my girlfriend, uh, Tina.
-Girlfriend? -Yes.
Yes, girlfriend. Nice to meet you.
This is my colleague, Yinka.
My friend, stop that!
What now, eh?
Can't a man feel up on his wife?
Or you don't want baby number two?
No, please! My body has not even recovered yet.
Ain't nobody got time for that!
You're not having it, are you? Nah-uh!
-Come here! -OK, I got a little time.
-That's my girl. -[laughs]
If you had introduced me to your friend,
this could have been our wedding.
-Uncle, you? Wedding? -Yes.
Please! [chuckles]
Look, I forgive you.
You can make it up to me.
That your friend there, you can introduce her to me, Agnes.
Agnes? Yes!
No offence, Uncle Mike, but I think Agnes would eat you for breakfast. Hey, hey, hey, hey...
May I have this dance?
Isoken tells me you're a very good dancer,
so please take it easy on me.
What did he say?
White boy wants to dance with you.
[laughs] Really?
Ye-Isoken, go and dance.
-He wants to dance? -Yes. -Go dance. -What's wrong with you?
-Come on! -Dance.
As per your prenuptial agreement,
you both get to keep whatever you owned before your union.
As for the house which you contributed equal funds and time,
I grant you your request.
Share the space equally if you are unwilling to sell. Good luck.

[Tony chuckles] I just wanted to see you before--
You are not supposed to see the bride before the wedding. I just needed to steal a quick kiss.
I just needed to steal a quick kiss.
-[Lulu giggles] -[Tony grunts]
Hello, Mum...
[Mrs. Wilson] Lu. How did it go?
It's done. There were no surprises.
-[Mrs. Wilson] Are you OK? -Yes.
Should I come and get you? I can be there in thirty minutes.
I'm not leaving. I thought I made myself clear on that.
Lu, this is insane. How can you live in the same house with your ex-husband?
I own half of that house,
and I won't give him the satisfaction of taking it.
I won’t let him win.
Nobody wins in a divorce.
Well, it’s where I live now. You either come and see me, or I'll come when I can.
OK. I’ll see you later.
OK, bye.
So?
It's official. [chuckles]
[sighs] I now have focus and direction.
Meaning you are moving out?
[scoffs] My friend, I said direction, not ejection.
I’m thinking of redecorating, actually.
Maybe some red walls, a ping pong table...
How about a housewarming party? [chuckles]
Tell me. Why were you trying to get divorced again?
Tony, just sell her the house now.
I made the first offer to buy that house, you know that?
She came back with a counteroffer and had the nerve to quote a lower price.
[scoffs] I love that house.
I made that house.
It’s my dream home.
You mean yours and hers.
Yeah, so we'll both have it.
After all, what else did she give me apart from heartaches?
So you are punishing her for...
ending a relationship you didn’t exactly fight for.
Look, I fought for that relationship right from the first time I kissed her,
and she said I tasted like herrings.
-Herrings. -Yes.
-You taste like herrings? -Are you crazy?
Frances, I told you. I’m not hungry.
OK, how about a drink?
-One. -Yeah.
♪ When you're moving it fast and you're Moving it slow, you know I lose my mind ♪ Can I have another one please?
Apparently, I am a drunk too.
Don’t worry. I won’t tell anybody.
Lulu, you do know that you're going to see Tony more in one week
than I'll ever shave my armpits in an entire year.
My God, how did I even get here?
You do know that sometime last week, I could have sworn I heard him jerking off in the middle of the night.
I could have sworn I heard him jerking off in the middle of the night.
[shrieks] Maybe he saw you naked. Got him all worked up.
You think he’s spying on me?
As you listen to him too, sweetie.
Pervert.
Oh. There they go.
Who was that?
My alarm says Tony is an hour away.
-Away from where? -Home.
And you set an alarm for that? Well, I like to get there first before he does.
I mean, I don’t have time for all the awkward greetings.
Oh my goodness, how I wish I could erect a new staircase
from behind the house all the way upstairs. Oh!
You do know you can make this a lot simpler
and so much cheaper if you just get the hell out of there.
And give him the satisfaction of keeping my dream house? Hell to the no!
Lulu, this is insane, even for you.
I am doing just fine, sweetheart.
Now you, on the other hand, need to come visit before I divorce you too. ♪ Hey da da, Hey da da ♪
Mr. Quartey. Please come.
Henceforth, I need you to use this side of the entrance, OK?
And make sure you park the car more towards this side.
Exactly on this angle. Right here, OK?
Exactly on this angle. Right here, OK? -Yes, madam. -It's...
-Yes, madam. -It's...
Miss Wilson, Mr. Quartey. And take note
Miss Wilson, Mr. Quartey. And take note that a lot of things are going to change around this house.
And don’t forget to park the car exactly on this angle.
Yes, Miss Wilson.
Good afternoon, Mr. G. Good afternoon, Mr. Quartey.
Are you going somewhere?
I am moving the car, sir.
To where?
To Miss Wilson’s side of the entrance, sir.
Oh, of course.
What about a gate?
I am sorry, sir?
Aren’t you guys erecting another gate on your side of the house?
I don’t think that will be necessary, sir. Ah, you don’t know that for sure. Things have changed around here.
Ah, you don’t know that for sure. Things have changed around here.
Home sweet home.
-[exhales] -[music fades out] [Lulu] Tony...
Tony...
What is it?
Sorry. I was going to come and clean it.
Ten minutes after you’ve brushed your teeth?
I'm sick and tired of picking after you, Tony. You are not a five-year-old.
Was that even necessary?
Don’t speak to a man like he’s an idiot.
I wouldn't if he does what he's supposed to do.
Like putting down the toilet seat once it's done,
like throwing away your empty deodorant cans once you've finished,
like replacing the soap once you used the last drop,
or like washing the lather off the walls once you finish bathing.
Unbelievable. I'm like living with my mother now.
You sure know how to make a man feel small, don't you?
-[Tony] I want to kiss you. -[Lulu laughs] No.
Sorry, but you shouldn’t have done that. It's just a fucking kiss.
What’s wrong with you?
You know I don’t like doing that before brushing my teeth in the morning. Yeah, clearly, you don't do a lot of things, Miss Perfect.
Yeah, clearly, you don't do a lot of things, Miss Perfect.
What’s that supposed to mean?
What kind of female are you?
Most women would love to be kissed, cuddled, made love to in the morning--
I am not most women. Well, clearly...
You didn’t seem to have a problem with that.
Yeah, well I do now...
I have a problem with not being able to kiss my wife after we wake,
not being able to cuddle her because her neck will hurt,
not being able to make love to her right after her menses because she’s raw,
not being able to get into the shower with her because she will itch...
Hell, I have a problem with marrying the least of all women.
I decided to prepare you something.
Aw. You didn’t have to.
Thank you.
How are you?
Managing.
Shouldn’t we drop this in the kitchen?
Let's go upstairs, Mummy. Trust me.
You are not allowed to stay downstairs?
This is my space.
And whose decision was that?
Both of us.
You guys managed to agree on everything except staying married.
[whispering] Mom!
And how long is this arrangement supposed to last?
Well, for as long as I live here.
Lu...
Mummy, please. Not you too.
I would be a bad mother if I pretend that this is OK.
I mean, all mothers want their children to be happy.
Married... with kids...
Maybe that’s just not for me, Mummy.
Sorry. Come here.
You deserve every happiness that life can offer.
Are we allowed to have your birthday party here?
Now look who is trying to be mean.
Oh, is this allowed?
What? Laughing?
This must be awkward even for you.
It will be fine, Mummy. Trust me.
Now laugh... Laugh...
That’s more like it! [laughs]
Oh, I am sorry... I didn’t... know there was anyone here.
It's just me, Tony. You don’t have to leave.
I hope I am not in your way.
My daughter said I have to stay on this side of the kitchen.
No, [clears throat] you are fine.
How are you?
I... I'm OK.
Come.
I brought some food. Would you like some?
Uh, no.
You always said I was the better cook.
Mrs. Wilson...
I... I can’t take this.
Why not?
Because...
[sighs] Well... again...
I won’t tell if you don’t.
Go on.
Thank you.
I brought enough food for the both of you.
I guess that’s your side of the kitchen?
Uh, yes.
Mrs. Wilson.
I think this is a bad idea.
From the man who is living with his ex-wife?
Which level is yours?
The bottom.
How is it?
Great.
You know...
I... I always thought
-if anyone was going to... -[refrigerator dings]
make a good wife out of my daughter,
it would be you.
I am sorry.
So am I, Tony.
So am I.
Good night.
Good night.
Oh my...
Drink it before I spank you!
Good morning.
Morning.
I...
I thought to let you know that I am hiring help
I thought to let you know that I am hiring help to come do some cleaning.
I don’t need one, thank you.
Actually, it's not for the both of us,
just me.
I just wanted you to know in case you run into her.
Her?
Yes, it’s a girl.
OK.
Is this the pity party? [chuckles]
Come in, man.
You know, if I didn’t know better,
I would say that you’ve been avoiding coming here.
Avoiding this situation is more like it.
And you are supposed to be my boy?
Now, if I was dragged to court
to testify against you being a very terrible ex-husband,
would you want me to testify truthfully or falsely?
Uh, truthfully. Good. So the less I see of you here, the better for you, my friend.
Good. So the less I see of you here, the better for you, my friend.
I guess you have a point but wait...
Are you saying that I am a terrible husband?
Your Honor, I guess he meant ex-husband.
Son of a bitch. Beer?
Sure.
How are you?
I’m great.
Where is she?
So this is officially your space?
Yeah. You know, this and two bedrooms
and half of the kitchen and half of the compound.
[commentator on TV] Along with Barcelona and Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao have never been in the Primera division--
Any luck with the help?
Yeah, I have some options, but I am still trying to make up my mind.
[commentator on TV] It's a brilliant run from Messi going all the way...
Goal!
Sorry, sorry!
[commentator on TV] It’s going to be three Copa De Rey final goals...
from the magical... imperial...
Lionel Messi.
Lights up the Camp Nou
-one more time. -Are you sure?
Yeah, it’s good.
Lulu.
Fred...
Hi.
You uh... OK?
Yeah... I'm good... good.
OK, so... I'm just gonna go out to meet some friends for dinner.
Oh, OK.
-See you around. -Sure.
You all right, man?
Yup.
Oh boy, your babe is hot.
She’s not my babe.
Right.
And you are not... Goal-- [mutters]
We are pulling you guys tonight.
Excuse me.
Oh, hi...
Hello. You must be Lulu?
I am Marian... Mr. Tony’s help.
"Help."
Yes, the help.
Well, um... I hope you don’t mind. I took some of your sugar to make Tony...
[clears throat] Mr. Tony’s tea.
He’s run out, and I'll later go for shopping for him.
OK.
See you around.
[Lulu] The help is a tall, pretty, 20-something-year-old
with a weave the length of the Kagera Nile.
Look, I'm not even surprised 'cause Tony will do anything to get me upset.
What if he's genuinely hiring her services?
Oh, yes, he is all right. For sex.
Lulu, helps come in different shapes and sizes these days, you know.
Would you bring a hot looking gentleman
into the home you share with your ex-husband?
No, but I won’t share the same house as my ex-husband.
What if he brings in a girlfriend? Huh? Have you thought of that?
I thought of everything, Frances.
And if this is Tony’s way of getting me out, he is in for a real shock.
It's on.
What’s on?
-♪ Nobody there when he follow me ♪ -OK.
Excuse me...
[forcefully] Excuse me.
Excuse me. Hey.
Who are you?
Gabby... Miss Wilson’s help.
So...
what else do you do around here apart from bathing her car?
Cook, clean... You know.
I see.
Hey, you know... Has anybody told you you look like Clark Kent?
You know, Superman.
Man of Steel, baby!
We need to talk.
-I'm listening. -You didn’t tell me
you were hiring help, too.
Oh that... sorry. He came in earlier than expected.
[scoffs] You are so predictable. I hire help, you hire help--
What’s good for the gander, Tony...
Besides, I don’t remember having any problems when you brought in Miss World.
And that’s why Mr. World is out there? You are jealous?
What do you want, Tony?
I expect to be told if I'm going to be running
I expect to be told if I'm going to be running into strange shirtless men on my lawn.
That is my half of the lawn.
And I don’t remember being asked permission before you brought in that--
I told you she was coming before she came.
What difference did that make? Hm?
I have a man help servicing my needs in this house.
Get used to it.
Hey. Uh... This is for you.
For me?
Yeah.
OK.
Oh, wow.
Oh my God.
You shouldn’t have.
It's nothing really.
No one has ever bought anything this beautiful for me before.
Yeah, I just, you know,
thought I should get you something for all the work that you do around here.
Nice?
Yeah. It’s very nice.
Thank you.
Wow, thank you so much. Oh, thank you.
It’s OK.
You wanted to see me?
Um, yes... Yes, just come in.
So I found this, and I thought it would look very good on you.
It’s a slim fit shirt. I want you to wear it when you are not washing. OK?
Thank you.
You are welcome. And if you need anything else, just make sure you let me--
What the hell was that for?
[clears throat] I thought--
You thought what?
I'm sorry, I... Look, I thought you wanted me to do that.
You are paying me a lot of money to be here, wash your car...
And I-- I just...
you know, walking around doing nothing. And then you buy me gifts...
What am I supposed to think?
-So that's not what you-- -No.
What I want is...
You know what, Gabby? Just do your job.
OK.
You can go now.
Do you want me to-- Yes, and I want you to wear it.
-Can I ask you something? -[music pauses]
-It’s OK. Never mind. -[song starts again]
Grab drinks, I’ll see you soon.
What the hell?
Everything OK...
Get out.
Get out!
If I see you here again, I swear I will kill you.
Don’t come back.
You are so despicable, you know that?
What! What did she say to you?
What did she say to me? What did she say to you?
I don’t know what you are talking about!
You don’t know what I'm talking about?
-Yes, I mean, look-- -How can you stand there
and lie to me in my face like that?
Lie to you? She said something to you.
I don’t know what she said, so I don’t know why you are saying--
I will never forgive you for this.
It’s all your fault. You brought her in here.
You brought him here, and you are saying this is my fault?
I told you before I brought her here. I will never forgive you for this. Never.
Forgive me for what? I don’t even know what you’re--
Lulu, if I don't know what she told you,
then how do I know what you're talking about?
What is this? What’s wrong? I have no freaking idea!
[Mrs. Wilson] OK, stop!
What's going on?
I don’t understand what it is, and when I try to understand--
[Lulu] He decides to bring a girl into the house and when I--
No! No!
You speak only when I ask you to.
So as not to be accused of siding with my daughter,
I'm going to ask Tony to speak first.
Tony.
I came home and found our helps doing each other.
Doing?
They were having sex on my bed.
Oh, I see.
Go on.
Of course, I asked them to leave and never come back.
And on their way out, my help says something to her,
and she gets upset, but doesn't tell me what the girl says
and she gets upset, but doesn't tell me what the girl says but insists on calling me these horrible names--
but insists on calling me these horrible names--
I only called you despicable, Tony.
You will stop at nothing to see me miserable.
This from someone who asked me for a divorce?
Let’s not forget who broke up this marriage.
If you wanted it that much, why didn't you fight for it?
Like the way you fought for it? The way you did?
Tony, you know I fought for it. I worked my butt off--
Stop!
Tony, I've heard your side of the story.
Lulu, what did the girl say to you?
Lulu...
[scoffs] I can’t.
Lulu!
I haven’t done anything. I swear, I haven’t.
Come.
Why do you two insist on destroying each other?
This is clearly unhealthy.
[scoffs] Sell the house.
Move on.
Unless it’s more... complicated than that.
They say it’s only the tortoise
that knows what's, um... hiding under its shell.
Lulu.
Lulu, open the door.
I... I made you...
I have tea.
I used honey, half a teaspoon...
and some lemon or lime...
I never know the difference.
And, uh...
I'm sorry.
None of this, like...
None of this makes sense anymore.
Lulu...
I brought you some tea.
Thank you.
Uh, Lulu,
I... really want to know what she said to you.
-[somber music playing] -Lulu, please.
OK. Well, she--
Because I would never...
You'd never...
-[rooster crowing] -Sorry, let me just--
It’s Fred, just give me a sec.
Hey, dude, can I call you back? I am in the middle of...
What?
OK, all right, um... I’m on my way...
Is he OK?
His wife collapsed.
Bertha?
They are at the hospital, so I have to go and--
It’s fine.
Hey, look, I would've come with you, but... It's fine. I’ll tell him.
It's fine. I’ll tell him.
OK, thanks. It’s fine. Leave it.
Tony.
Yeah, hi.
Hey, is everything OK?
Uh, yeah.
[mumbles] I have to stay with Fred tonight at the hospital.
Oh... what’s wrong?
Well, she's still out of it.
I don’t want to leave him by himself.
OK.
Do you need anything?
Um, no. I am OK.
Hey, look, I can bring you change of clothes.
That would be nice.
OK. See you soon.
All right. Bye.
Hey.
Sorry...
How is she?
-Stable. -[sighs]
It's a kidney disease.
Nobody knew she had it.
One of those ones.
Is she going to be OK?
[sighs] They are running more tests.
I’d like to go and see her if that’s OK.
Fred would like that.
Tough guy.
You should have seen him.
Composed. Like a picture of... strength.
Uh... I can’t manage it.
Well, I think you can manage it just fine.
I don’t know a tougher guy.
That almost sounds like a compliment.
Well, I think it is.
Here I was... thinking you were my strength.
Tony... Hey.
Watching her lying there...
Just hanging on...
I couldn’t-- I couldn't help but think of you.
You know, of...
Of us.
What if things just ended now?
It will end badly, Lulu.
Very badly.
You are renting your side of the house?
Wait, what, what...
Why is there a woman out there asking to rent your space?
-Oh, uh, well... -Huh, what was that?
No, I didn’t hear you.
I guess I am very stupid.
Some cheap teary tricks to get me into your bed?
[scoffs] If I remember clearly, you came to me.
Maybe that’s because you were crying so hard like a baby.
Even I wouldn't stoop this low, Lulu. [scoffs] Don’t you dare try to turn this on me.
You're the one who find it so difficult to live with me under one roof.
[scoffs] You know, I don’t know about you, Lulu,
but as much as I have tried, I have found it incredibly hard
to live with you under the same roof
because after all, we are separated
and seeing you every day just deepens my guilt about our divorce,
our failed marriage.
And secondly, I meant everything that I said to you last night,
and as far as the lovemaking goes, you and I know that we’ve never needed tricks.
Oh... That has always been a problem, hasn't it, Tony?
You do exactly what you feel like when you feel like it.
And me, I always find out when it's too late.
[to himself] Hey... Sorry about this morning
because... I wanted to tell you about it, but we weren't speaking,
and I felt that another woman... [imitating Lulu] You felt?
You felt? It's always about you, Tony.
You do exactly what you, when you want...
[as himself] Yeah, well I thought that you’d be pleased to see me go...
I thought you hated me...
[imitating Lulu] Oh... no baby, I don’t hate you.
Come, let’s make love.
Lulu!
I changed the locks, Tony.
Lulu, I am tired. I am not in the mood for games.
You don’t live here anymore, Tony. You broke our deal.
I didn’t break any deal!
Look, I had a thought.
Oh... OK. How about I give you something else to think about?
This crazy arrangement is over.
I get to keep the house, and you... get a life. How's that?
Look, I have a life, OK?
And it’s not out here. Open this door, damn it!
Jesus...
All right. OK, I'm sorry but...
I wasn’t going to move her in without telling you first.
Really?
Just like you told me about your new job on the day of your appointment?
Or when you decided to have dinner with your ex-girlfriend
and only told me when I walked in on you?
Oh, wait. Here's a very good one.
You remember when you decided for the both of us
it was time to have a baby?
You perfectly timed my ovulation
and proceeded to blast everything inside of you into me.
It’s all about Tony’s perfect timing.
It’s all about you, Tony.
-OK, all right. So, I have my flaws. -[Lulu] Mm.
But what about you? Eh? You are so... like...
So what? Mm. I'm so what?
-Cat got your tongue? -So uptight!
Like I have to think of every little detail of every conversation
that I want to have with you before I have it.
And then when I finally do, you put big holes in my little ideas
and bury me with it.
And you wonder why I don’t tell you anything anymore.
Good night, Tony.
Lulu, Lulu, you better come and open this door.
I swear, I will break this door down. I will break this door down!
I will tear this whole house down. Lulu!
Tony...
Tony...
You can come in now...
Tony...
OK.
I am not playing any of your games. I am going in now...
Tony...
This isn’t over yet...
Aren’t you going to say anything?
-What the hell? -Shut your mouth!
All right, guys, this will be over before you know it
so can we kindly all act as grown-ups?
Hm? Thank you. Gabby...
-Yeah. -Tell them why we are here.
Yeah. You see... when you people hired us,
eh... gave us all that money
and then you got gifts for us--
This is a robbery!
Sh! Could you be any louder?
Could you be any slower?
-Sh! -What? OK, this bullshit has gone too far now.
-Did I ask you to speak? -And I didn’t invite you into my house,
but you're here now, so let's talk, shall we? What do you want?
Well, I want money.
-[clears throat] -What?
Excuse me. We... we want money.
Don't forget whose idea this was in the first place.
Your idea? [scoffs] Please, nigga, I am the one who brought us here in the first place.
nigga, I am the one who brought us here in the first place.
I am the one who went upstairs and got kissed--
-[Marian and Tony] What! -[Tony] You kissed him?
[Lulu] No. He kissed me. Wait, you kissed me.
You kissed her? I thought you said she kissed you.
[stammers] What does it matter?
It matters, damn it! Who kissed who?
Look, girl, if it’s money you want,
I don’t have any. I don’t keep money at home.
OK, what about jewelry? Diamonds and the bits.
[laughs] You actually think I have diamonds?
Well, he told me he bought you diamonds.
I did.
Oh, you did?
Yes, you returned it to the jewelers.
Apparently, the stone was too small or something.
Is that what your little girlfriend told you?
She’s not my girlfriend.
Hm. Well, the jury is still out on that one.
But I know what I saw, and it didn’t look like it was nothing.
[scoffs] You saw us?
-Yes, I did. -[scoffs]
About two days before the diamond ring arrived,
I saw you guys having dinner at Labadi Beach Hotel.
Now that stupid ring was... was a way to compensate
for whatever you did that night with her.
I am not some stupid girl that gets appeased with diamonds.
-[Tony] Oh, really? -[Lulu] Yes.
I had dinner with Thelma that night
because she had waited all day to pick up your ring
from the manufacturers. She had to be with her family,
but I kept her there so I could pick it up.
And so when it came at 9:30,
the least I could do was to buy dinner for her
as a way of saying thank you for your ring.
[grunts] So, where is the diamond ring?
God, Gabby. Gabby, did you not hear them? He said he's returned it!
Yeah, so let’s go and pick it up.
[patronizingly] Oh, of course we can go and pick it up, Gabby.
You know what? I have an idea.
Why don’t we call Thelma
and ask her to come to the shop and open it for us, hm?
OK, uh... so there’s no diamond.
What about gold? Guys, I am not picky.
Help me out here. Anything?
Oh! Tony, darling,
why don’t you give them your gold watch and put us out of this misery?
Where is the watch your wife bought you? I am beginning to lose my patience.
I gave it away.
You gave the watch away?
I gave it to Cecil.
Oh! You gave it to your brother? Wow, now I feel so much better.
Oh, don’t play that guilt card with me, Lulu.
You always knew I didn’t like yellow gold.
I said this much when we had dinner with Fred and Bertha on their wedding anniversary.
with Fred and Bertha on their wedding anniversary. Five weeks later, you buy me a yellow gold watch
Five weeks later, you buy me a yellow gold watch as a birthday gift?
My God, it was a $5,000 TAG Heuer watch.
It was yellow gold.
You never listen... just this... little voices in your head.
Wait-- Wait a minute...
-[laughs] -OK, so what’s funny?
[Lulu] I wasn’t even there.
That night at dinner, I had a phone call,
and I excused myself for a while. I was gone for a very long time.
When I came back, I asked you guys what I had missed,
and Fred said you were talking about some precious minerals.
You made a joke, and we laughed.
You punish me for trying?
I wasn’t even there, and guess who doesn’t remember?
Because all you think about is the fact that Lulu is insensitive,
Lulu doesn’t care...
You never really gave me a chance, Tony.
Don’t cry.
He doesn’t deserve you.
What was that?
I said he doesn’t deserve her.
Shut up, Gabby. It’s not like she’s perfect.
Yeah. What kind of man gives away a $5,000 watch
just because he doesn’t like the color yellow?
And what kind of woman gives back a...
A 10,000...
10,000 diamond ring
just because she thinks her husband is cheating on her?
Who does that?
If you had asked me, I think they deserve each other.
OK, we are going to search ourselves. Hm?
Yeah.
So you take his room, Tony, and I’ll take Lulu’s.
Why do I get Tony’s room?
Because you are a man, and you know where men hide stuff.
You know where to look.
I don’t want any cuff links or any ties. I really want good valuable stuff, OK?
-OK? -Yeah.
Good.
Go on.
Lulu, my mobile phone is in my pocket.
Just come closer so you can try and reach it in my back pocket.
Uh. I don’t know, Tony...
Are you saying we should stay here till they come back?
I don’t think they will harm us.
And when they come back with nothing?
They’ll find something...
My wedding ring.
I didn’t know you still had that.
Look, Lulu...
I am sorry...
for the wristwatch, for...
for everything.
I know we are better people than this.
And I-- And I think so because we agreed to get married.
I just-- I just think that we--
[Marian] What was that?
-[groaning] I think I shot my ass. -What!
Oh my God!
-Is it really bad? -This is not good.
I can feel my legs giving way. I am going to be a cripple.
-Oh, sorry, sorry... what happened? -[groans]
I sat on the gun. [groans]
-Where is the gun? -[Gabby grunts]
[Marian] OK, I'm gonna go get it.
What? And abandon me?
Here? Really?
OK, you know what? Just let me do this. -[groans in pain] -Just hold it there.
-[whimpers] -You need to get to the hospital as soon as possible.
Does anyone know how to take a bullet out of an ass?
Look, I need to get to a hospital right now.
No, Gabby. This gun is not registered. They're going to call the police.
[whimpers] I am going to die.
Stop crying! I am trying to think!
I have a doctor friend who can take care of this.
On one condition...
You untie us, you leave this place and never come back.
Done... Done. Deal. Untie them!
No.
No?
No! What if they attack us or call the police?
Marian...
We want this ordeal to be over as much he does.
As long as you stay away, we have a deal.
I swear on every advice that my mother gave me on women,
I will shoot you where you stand if you don’t untie them right now!
God, Gabby. You are such an ass. You are such an ass!
I don’t have an ass. I need a hospital!
What did you tell my wife?
What?
My ex-wife...
you said something to her on the day I found you in bed with him.
You spoke to her on your way out. What did you tell her?
Nothing.
What do you mean nothing?
Exactly that. Nothing.
-[scoffs] -Why? What did she say I told her?
I just didn’t say anything.
-Oh, how conveniently, Lulu. -[melancholic music playing]
And yet you acted like I committed the most hideous of crimes?
-Well, I thought you-- -[shouts] You thought what?
I will not talk to you like this.
Oh, you will talk to me right now.
You don’t get to pull an act like that,
shed some fake tears in front of your mother,
act hurt, and then just not want to talk about it.
Well, I thought you instigated it. You thought I instiga... Oh... [chuckles]
You thought I got Marian to sleep with your boyfriend?
He’s not my boyfriend.
No. What can I say? You two kissed.
He kissed me!
And I’m sure there was a lot of encouragement with that.
No! You do not get to slap me.
Look, those two would have found themselves as they should have.
But for you to accuse me of instigating so... I can’t--
You brought her into our house, Tony. And it got your attention, didn’t it?
So that's it? All you wanted was my attention?
Yes, damn it. I wanted your attention. I wanted it.
We have been married for two years,
but you treat me like I am a stranger in my own house.
Oh, please, don’t you dare accuse me of raising barriers.
You wouldn't even look at me when I came down to say hi to Fred.
Yeah, well, you were on your way out to go be eaten by some maniac--
I am not going to let you go. You are not going to try and slap me
-and then think it’s... that it's fine. -[grunts]
What are we going to do?
I don’t know.
We can’t... continue like this.
I know.
Do you still love me?
Because I still do.
♪ Feels like I'm walking in circles ♪ ♪ Not going nowhere ♪
[Lulu] I’m thinking white everywhere.
Are you sure about this?
OK, maybe grey. Grey around it won’t be too bad.
I’m talking about Tony.
Is this what you really want?
He says he still loves you.
Mum, it won’t change anything.
-Lulu... -Mum.
He said he loved me before we got married.
He loved me whilst we were married,
and he still loves me even after the divorce.
What difference would that make? It doesn’t change who we are,
what we want, and how we got here in the first place.
You haven’t learned anything.
I have. Oh, I have. I've learned that Tony
I have. Oh, I have. I've learned that Tony is a selfish, egotistic, competitive man
who would never change.
I'm sure he has a tall list for me too.
And yet he still says he loves you.
Do you know how difficult that must be for him?
Mum, why are you telling me all this now?
Because nobody is perfect.
That's the lesson I hoped you would have learned.
[scoffs] I have been married to your father for 33 years and some.
And the only thing that stops me ramming his teeth down his throat
every time he snores loudly beside me...
is-- is that lesson.
None of us is perfect.
And that's what makes the ride fun.
Do you still love him?
That makes it easier then.
Nobody is born wise.
Figure something out... please.
Where is he now?
He's at the house. The agent said he hasn’t moved out yet.
Maybe we should put the decorating
on hold for a few more days
whilst you get creative.
[sighs] Let me get you something to drink.
Um... More reds than whites.
You need to be a bit more frisky.
Hey.
You are too uptight, Lulu.
Honey, I could only find disposable--
-Hi... -Hi.
[Tony] Clarissa, you were saying...
Hi, Tony.
Hi.
I found her here.
It’s OK.
You want something?
Lulu...
Well, I... [clear throat] I came by to get something from my room...
I used my key.
I didn’t realize you still had stuff here.
Well, no... Yeah... a few bits here and there.
You know what? I'll just go get it.
Wait...
I might be here for a while, until my place is ready. I hope you don’t mind.
until my place is ready. I hope you don’t mind.
No. Um...
Until we find someone to...
rent this place, of course.
Thanks.
OK, I'll just, um...
She used to live here. We lived here together.
I thought that was when you were still married.
No, even after marriage.
Why?
She wouldn’t move, I wouldn’t move.
She won't leave; I won’t leave... It was just what it was.
I see. You two are definitely a strange pair. [chuckles]
So they keep telling me.
So what now?
I'm not sure I follow.
Is it really over between you two?
What?
Are you... Are you trying to open a night club?
Why? What’s with all the red stuff?
[scoffs] So apparently, I am too uptight,
so here is my lousy attempt to be frisky.
-[chuckles] OK. Got it. -[laughs]
Where are the beds?
Please don't by a red bed.
Mm... I don’t know. I can’t promise you that.
-No red bed. -[laughs]
So... what did she look like?
Oh... yeah...
hm... the usual Tony type.
Tall, slim, you know, pageant-looking almost.
I see. I am still confused as to why he married you.
Well, hopefully this divorce is gonna help the confusion.
What? You think I am going to break into some uncontrollable tears right now?
Well, that would be normal.
No, it wouldn't. What is wrong with you people?
I’m abnormal. I'm uptight. What else?
Be careful what you wish for.
What? You are going to turn into Kim Kardashian now?
Well, I just might. I've got the backside for it.
-All I need is my Russell Crowe. -[laughs]
Sweetie, it’s Kanye West.
Shut up, no.
Yes.
I thought it was Russell... Oh, well, I prefer Russell.
And I prefer Justin Bieber, but here we are.
I did not know you like small boys, you cougar.
And I didn’t know you were into old and flabby men.
First of all,
Russell is not old, and he's definitely not flabby.
And Justin is not little.
See my point? Potato, potahto.
-[both laugh] -Just on and off.
So... this is it?
Well, I’ll actually miss you guys together.
Yeah, I'm serious. You guys actually looked...
cute together.
Well too bad the cuteness couldn’t sustain the ugliness.
Come on, man.
You are not the worst couple in the world, trust me.
Says the happily married man.
I had an affair.
Yeah. Surprise, surprise.
Wait, what?
When?
Why? How?
Last Christmas...
we met at the mall.
She had too much to carry, and I offered to help her to her car.
And?
We exchanged numbers and...
started spending time together.
She didn’t have a boyfriend?
Married...
-three kids. -[groans]
She was the most exciting woman I had ever met.
Son of a...
So, what? She was bored? You were unhappy?
I didn’t even know I was unhappy
until she came along.
Suddenly, I didn’t look forward to coming home anymore.
And Bertha didn’t even know how gone I was.
The thing is...
we had gotten used to each other, so used to each other.
We... We didn’t argue, we didn’t fight,
we just... got along...
Yeah, and it made me angry. Really angry.
[scoffs] Wait...
You were angry because you weren't fighting?
I was angry because there was no reaction.
I just wanted some form of reaction,
some attention, her attention, any attention.
And... I came home one day and blurted it out.
I was having an affair.
She cried... too much.
I knew I had hurt her.
I ended it...
six months after it started.
The affair was done, but I got my reaction.
But you know what? Till today, that's the only source of our argument,
and I am grateful for it.
Yeah. Listen, I am not proud of what I did,
but it woke my marriage up.
It was dying, man.
One day, I would have just upped and left.
So why didn’t you tell me about the affair?
I didn’t want to give you the wrong reason to leave.
And now you think I have the right reasons?
You guys argued to the very end though,
and I think you gave it your best shot.
I sure did,
and up to the point that I told her that I still loved her.
-You what? -[sentimental music playing]
Yeah, I told you that--
No, wait. You told her you still loved her?
And what did she say?
Don’t answer. She still moved out.
So... this is me.
OK.
So... you're sure I can’t come in?
Well, I have an early morning tomorrow. Maybe next time.
Did... did you just puke in my mouth?
I think so... [coughs]
I'm sorry. I have to go.
What is it with these old women?
-Ah! -You've met my daughter before.
-Oh yes. Lulu, right? -Yes, ma’am.
I was at your wedding.
Yes, you were!
-Yes. -[both laugh]
How is your handsome husband?
He is great. Everyone is fine.
Any children yet?
No, not yet. But sometime soon.
-You know how these modern couples are. -Yes.
Anyway, it’s been good seeing you again.
-I should be leaving now. Thank you. -OK.
Mum, say something.
I’m sorry. I had no idea you were seeing anybody.
I mean, you only moved out a couple of weeks ago.
It’s Tony’s.
Sorry?
We... we slept together...
-twice... after the divorce. -[melancholic music playing]
I...
I-- I don’t know what to say.
Perhaps you should say I messed up this time.
It’s your child too, Lulu.
And it's not such a bad thing.
Really?
Tony has already moved on, and I'm going to become his baby mama?
I don’t think so. I'm getting rid of it.
Are you crazy?
And at your age?
I don’t care how you want to spin this.
You are not getting rid of anything!
Plus, he has a right to know. He is the father after all.
Please! On which planet does Tony deserve to know anything?
He’s already dating.
If I remember rightly, you moved out.
So what? I'm easily replaceable?
We don’t always get what we want,
and right now, I really don’t think you know what that is.
Well, I know I don’t want a child right now.
Why did you really come here, Lu? It seems you’ve already made up your mind.
I could do with your support.
What kind of mother would that make me?
Mine.
Look, I have to go. My appointment is in an hour.
Lu... please. Don’t do this.
[sighs] I love you.
[Mrs. Wilson] I am not happy about this.
Well, like you said, we don’t always get what we want.
Hi.
Hi.
I, uh...
came to make sure that everything is in its place
before the new tenants move in.
Yeah, me too.
I’ll just go check the kitchen.
Sure.
Tony.
Well, there is something I have to tell you.
What?
I'm pregnant.
OK.
OK?
What did you expect me to say?
I don’t know. But I wasn’t expecting an OK considering you put it there.
It’s mine?
Yes.
[scoffs] I don’t believe this.
Imagine my surprise.
So what does this mean?
I don’t know. I wanted to get rid of it.
And why would you even think that? Why not?
Wait, are you upset?
Shouldn’t I be?
-Lulu... -Don’t touch me.
I'm going to be saddled with a kid whilst you go out there and have all the fun.
whilst you go out there and have all the fun.
What fun?
You move a woman in. No wait, you move a girl in... the moment I moved out.
What kind of a man are you?
One that feels rejected.
Wait, look. You don’t want me, Lulu. [scoffs]
I do.
That’s what I came back to...
Well, I came back to...
Tell you...
You came back to tell me what?
[sighs] Stop it.
-You came back to tell me what? -[smirks]
You are going to make me say it, aren’t you? You bet.
Well... [clears throat]
I came back to tell you that, um...
I love you.
-Tony. -What?
Lights. You didn’t change the lights.
Oh, shut up.
♪ My love ♪ So do we know what we're having?
No. But I hope it’s a boy.
-Really? -Mm-hm.
I think girls are adorable. I was actually aiming for a girl.
You didn’t aim... Wait.
What did you just say?
That I wanted a girl?
No, you said you "aimed" for a girl.
You’ve always known my cycle better than I... do.
Did you get me pregnant on purpose?
[scoffs] Are you really being serious right now?
You’ve done it before.
-So what? -I won’t put it past you.
You know what your problem is?
I'm sure you're about to tell me that right now.
You think the worst of everybody.
No, no. Not everybody...
how do you go about writing a life story?
Because… [sighs] …the true things rarely get into circulation.
It's usually the false things.
If you ever get any of those things you want to ask, I'll tell you.
All of those things come from the truth, you know?
Because otherwise, it's hard to know where to start
if you don't start with the truth.
-[switch clicks] -[man] The truth
and Marilyn, it's like going into the lion's den.
I got into the case when I was contacted out of the blue
by a senior British newspaper editor,
who said that the District Attorney in Los Angeles
had reopened the case of her death.
After 20 years, it's time to clear up this case.
[reporter 1] Monroe died from an overdose of sleeping pills.
Speculation surrounding Monroe's death continues to this day.
Was it a matter of taking too many pills? Was it a suicide?
[reporter 1] The charge is Marilyn Monroe was murdered.
[Anthony] And crazy conspiracy theories.
[reporter 1] Someone in the CIA killed Monroe.
There's a mystery about the story.
Sex and politics.
The Kennedy brothers.
The Cuban Revolution.
Question mark. Question mark. Question mark.
And that's where I came in.
I'm trying to get a handle on what kind of creature she was.
[man 1] She was very frightened.
[Anthony] I interviewed a thousand people.
[woman] There's a great myth around her.
[Anthony] I wound up with 650 tape-recorded interviews.
I hope I've not got obsessed.
[man 2] I hope your phone is clean.
[Anthony laughs] I hope so too, yes.
The tapes I accumulated during the writing of the book
have never been heard by the public.
[woman] Nobody ever knew everything.
[Anthony] What I learned was information that changed completely
what we thought we knew about her mysterious death,
and it suggests that the circumstances of her dying was covered up.
[Anthony] I worked in investigative journalism all over the world.
My initial idea was to spend two or three weeks working on the case,
and it turned into more than three years.
Marilyn Monroe had been a part of my growing up.
But I had a very peripheral knowledge of her life.
[announcer 1] Marilyn Monroe, the Golden Girl of Hollywood.
[announcer 2] The dazzling fame of Marilyn Monroe
delights the critics and attracts the public in swarms.
[Anthony] I knew that there was an absolute national
and international fascination with Marilyn.
[announcer 3] Marilyn Monroe was this era's sex symbol.
[announcer 4] Marilyn Monroe trod the summit of her profession.
[announcer 5] Something remarkable happened when she stepped before a camera.
[Anthony] She was also a remarkable actress.
[Anthony] A global figure of show business.
[announcer 6] A queen in her own realm of entertainment.
She was adored by millions.
[Anthony] Marilyn became the most famous woman in the world.
She still is.
[announcer 6] A self-illuminating body, a star.
[Anthony] I started work.
Finding people, knocking on doors.
Dig, dig, dig in that chatterbox of a place called Hollywood.
[Anthony] Glued to the phone…
…to get to people with information about the night Marilyn died.
[man 1] Tony, I have often said that I could put together
a scenario that would absolutely blow the minds of anybody who read it,
but it would be terribly costly to government agencies,
friends of mine, to people I know.
-[Anthony] Yeah. -I don't think I want to do that.
[Anthony] It was difficult.
[man 2] But I never talk to the press ever, ever, ever.
But I can't say anything, and I knew it all.
[Anthony] It was like banging on a brick wall.
-[man 3] Except it's a waste of your time. -[Anthony] Why?
And I wonder if you could--
I don't want to be the one who sets the record straight.
-But, I mean, I don't know you. -[Anthony] Fine.
Let it be.
[Anthony] I was getting nowhere.
So instead,
I did what you always have to do if you meet a dead end.
I went back to the beginning.
[announcer 7] Hollywood,
brilliant tinsel city of lights and fantasy.
Hollywood,
glorified, glittering, fascinating, fabulous mythical kingdom.
Hollywood, the glamour capital of the world.
[Marilyn] When I was a kid, and I remember at the movies on Saturday afternoon…
[actor 1] Let's take a spin down the Boulevard and see what we can find!
[Marilyn] …I'd never come out of the movie. They'd have to come get me.
[announcer 7] Ah, Garbo!
[Marilyn] Bad, good, didn't matter.
[announcer 7] Hollywood's playground!
[Marilyn] Anything that would move on the screen.
[announcer 7] And here inside the gates,
there's more stars than the Milky Way!
If you don't believe it, just follow us!
[Marilyn] My favorite was Jean Harlow.
-She had white hair. -[crowd cheering]
[announcer 7] The one and only Marlene Dietrich!
Cary Grant arrives with his best grin.
As usual, Cary has a genial greeting for everybody!
[Marilyn] And Clark Gable.
[announcer 7] Clark walked into the forecourt…
The crowd is still shouting for their favorite!
[Marilyn] Although I was a kid and I didn't know anything about acting,
I… [hesitates]
I wanted to know.
[Anthony] Could I speak to Al Rosen, please?
[Al] Talking.
[Anthony] Hello, Mr. Rosen.
[Al] Yup.
-Marilyn Monroe. I knew her very well. -[Anthony] You did?
-[Al] I'm talking about in the beginning. -[Anthony] Yes.
-[Al] When she was a kid. -[Anthony] At that time--
[Al] Well, I was… Al Rosen Agency was one of the top agencies in the business.
-[Anthony] Right. -We handled Cary Grant, Fredric March.
-Jack Oakie, Judy Garland, you know. -[Anthony] Right.
[Al] But, you see, the history of this business is
you got one thing, I'll guarantee it, which you didn't know about.
-In this business, in the golden years… -[Anthony] Yeah.
…every casting director, every studio used to have a black book,
you know what I mean?
So, every girl, you know, I'm talking about kids that were breaking in,
like Marilyn Monroe, you know, when they get started,
all the casting directors,
they would write in their black book who could be laid.
[Anthony] Hmm. Yeah.
[Al] You see, the business has changed since then.
Today, it's the buck.
[Anthony] Right.
It used to be sex. Remember that.
[announcer 1] Calling all girls! Calling all girls!
And now, all those lovely hopefuls have their chance.
The process of selecting just the right girls is a careful one.
[announcer 2] My, my, what a smart looking crowd.
Isn't she a honey?
Isn't she sweet?
Neck, 12 and a half.
Bust, 34 and a half.
[announcer 3] Pride. Adventure. Ambition.
From the ends of the Earth they come, waiting for the magic call.
-[phone line rings] -[Anthony] Hello?
[woman] Hello?
How can I help you?
[Anthony] You knew Monroe, um, at the beginning.
[Gloria] Well, my husband knew her first, early '40s.
[Anthony] Oh, as early as that?
[Gloria] Oh, yes.
You know, a generous girl, warm girl, really rather lovable.
She was very much on the restaurant scene and the club scene.
-[Anthony] But at Romanoff's. -[Gloria] Yeah. Enormous fun.
And it was quite exotic.
It had a real mélange of people,
and it was sort of the mecca for agents.
It had all of the film VIPs.
-All the pretty girls hung out there. -[Anthony] Right.
[Gloria] And Marilyn was among them, of course.
[announcer 3] So young is Hollywood
that many of its earliest pioneers are still active in the industry.
Men like Joseph Schenck, chairman of the board of 20th Century Fox.
Mr. Schenck brought about an era of epic, dramatic screen stories.
[Anthony] You know the stories about Schenck and her?
They were true, were they?
Oh, sure. Schenck was a human being.
-You know what I mean. -[Anthony] Yeah.
-You know what I mean. -[Anthony] Yeah. [Al] She had a bunch of 'em. He wasn't the only one.
[Al] She had a bunch of 'em. He wasn't the only one.
[Gloria] There were a group who gathered at Schenck's.
-She was always very much at his house. -[Anthony] Yeah.
[Gloria] And she was beginning to make a few strides.
[Anthony] So where are we now?
[Gloria] In 1948.
[Anthony] With Ladies of the Chorus. Hmm.
[Anthony] Male-dominated, women in movies exploited.
But it soon became clear that Marilyn was no pushover.
She wanted to be taken seriously.
She wanted to be an actress.
She worked the system to her own advantage.
Johnny Hyde was one of the most influential agents in the country.
Johnny Hyde loved her.
He left his wife on her account.
He was 53, 30 years older than she was, and very wealthy.
Hyde had access to the most powerful people in Hollywood.
He was also seriously ill and had less than 18 months to live.
Hyde devoted those months totally to Marilyn.
Her sugar daddy.
[Anthony] By night, he escorted her to the top people in town. ♪ Da-da-daddy But where's the one for me? ♪
[Anthony] By day, he praised Marilyn's talents.
Having Hyde's patronage could make her a star.
[John Huston] Johnny Hyde, who was a dear little man, wonderful little man…
-You know about him? -[Anthony] Yes.
-[Huston] Johnny was in love with her. -[Anthony] Yeah.
[Huston] Johnny Hyde spoke to me about her first and then brought her over to Metro.
Just, uh, very fresh.
Very attractive.
Rather timid.
Shy.
And, um we talked to her and gave her a script.
She went away and came back a day or two later,
and, well, Marilyn read her lines,
and she read them very beautifully, very well.
And there was no question.
She was ideal for the part.
-[Anthony] In The Asphalt Jungle? -Yes, indeed.
That was that.
[announcer] Only once in a decade does the screen come up with such absorbing characters.
such absorbing characters. Marilyn Monroe as Angela, the easy-living, green-eyed blonde.
Marilyn Monroe as Angela, the easy-living, green-eyed blonde.
[Huston] Marilyn went right down into her own personal experience.
For everything.
She would reach down and pull something out of herself
that was unique and extraordinary.
She found things about womankind in herself.
She had no technique.
It was all the truth.
It was only Marilyn, but she was Marilyn plus.
[presenter 1] An award to the popular new star.
And as best young box office personality, Miss Marilyn Monroe.
Thank you, Mr. Nichols.
[announcer] It's Marilyn Monroe, skyrocketing to new dramatic heights.
[presenter 2] Marilyn Monroe, all the moviegoers of America voted you
the most popular actress of the year. My congratulations.
Thank you, Mr. Sammis.
-Congratulations! -Thank you, Lauren.
And my thanks to Look magazine.
[announcer] A Hollywood incident that marks another salute to Marilyn Monroe.
Thank you. I thank you very much.
[host] And now here comes a young lady who has
created a real sensation in the picture business,
having won all kinds of awards as the number one newcomer of the year.
And believe me, a swell gal with a…
Take it from me, I've known her a long time, Miss Marilyn Monroe!
Let's hear it! Come on out here, Marilyn!
[narrator] With Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell.
[Anthony] Hello, Jane Russell?
[Jane Russell] Yes.
She was very bright, and she wanted to learn
and was interested in everything to help her control her career.
and was interested in everything to help her control her career. [Anthony] Right.
[Russell] And every night after work, she would go to the coach.
-[Anthony] Yes. -[Russell] We were going home exhausted.
She'd go to the coach.
But she wanted to be good.
Then when…
…the camera went on, it was like a whole electric light went on in the, you know…
[Anthony] Yeah.
[Russell] They just came to life.
[Marilyn] I just felt like I was on the outside of the world,
and suddenly everything opened up.
[Marilyn] The world became friendly. It opened up to me.
[Marilyn] I said, "Gee, what happened?"
[Marilyn] If I am a star, the people made me a star.
But I do want to be wonderful, you know.
[Marilyn] I want to do the best that I can do in that moment.
When the camera starts until it stops.
[Marilyn] That moment I want to be… perfect.
[Marilyn] I'll tell you,
I'm terribly grateful
because I remember when…
things weren't like this at all.
[Huston] I saw her a time or two.
-Years had gone by. -[Anthony] Yeah.
So she by now presumably looked different.
By now she was dressed to the T's, and she'd become the…
the sex symbol of this country.
And it wasn't… It wasn't just a sex thing at all.
Women felt just the same as men.
There was something deeply moving about Marilyn, always.
We were close during the picture,
and then we were… we, you know, considered ourselves friends,
but Marilyn kind of went from one group to another.
She would take off, and it would be another.
That would become the shell for a time.
She didn't go back and seek out any of the people
that had become close to her.
[Huston] There was something so vulnerable, so…
Something you felt
could be easily destroyed.
[Anthony] When you tackle so-called mysteries,
it's difficult.
What happened? Was it suicide? Was it accident?
Was it something more sinister?
[Anthony] So, it was like tapping cement with your finger.
And then I came across
the family of
the last psychiatrist.
It was a breakthrough.
Dr. Ralph Greenson,
the Hollywood psychiatrist
who treated and befriended Marilyn in her final years,
just before her death in 1962.
Ralph was dead.
He had left a widow, Hildi,
and his daughter, Joan,
and his son, Danny.
They were really helpful interviews that gave me a real insight.
-[man] Hello? -[Anthony] Hi.
I know that your father took over the West Coast work with Marilyn in 1960,
just short of two years that he was involved with her till she died.
[Danny] Well, I hated Hollywood. My family knew enough Hollywood people.
You know, I had, at times, met movie stars at parties
and found the whole thing to be obnoxious.
My notion was these people were… were phoneys and narcissistic characters.
I hated 'em.
So when I heard that Dad was seeing Marilyn,
I was not jumping up and down and cheering.
He couldn't see her at the office. She was too goddamn famous.
He was seeing her at home. I thought, "What a bunch of bullshit."
[woman] I mean, here's the sex symbol of the world.
Here is, you know, what womanhood should be in a nutshell.
[Joan] I mean, there was something about Marilyn
that put her apart from everybody else.
But there were times, you know, that I would pick her up in my Hillman Minx.
-You know, and… -[Anthony] Yeah.
Marilyn without makeup and a scarf over her hair and just sitting there,
you know, you wouldn't think would attract any kind of attention,
and yet, you know, I would suddenly have five people washing my windows.
-But there was just something. -[Anthony] Yeah.
It happened to me too.
[Anthony] Because they knew she was Marilyn--
No! No!
[Joan] There was an at-homeness with her body
that very… I have never seen anybody else have.
To be sort of almost animal-like
in their feel and their movement and…
You know, beautiful and very, in a sense, poetic.
Hildi allowed me access to many of Dr. Greenson's papers, his letters,
which were gold dust.
He thought that Marilyn had a tendency to paranoid reactions.
However, she wasn't schizophrenic,
and her paranoid-like reactions are more masochistic.
Greenson thought that the tendency towards
acting out of the orphan girl rejections
seemed to him central.
She was a waif.
Marilyn's troubled childhood
was a time that the grown woman was never going to forget.
She spent time in ten foster homes,
two years in an orphanage,
another foster home,
four years with a guardian,
when her mother was packed off to a mental asylum.
[Marilyn] And I'm not calling myself an orphan.
I was brought up a waif.
Yeah, I was never used to being happy.
So that wasn't something I was sort of counting on.
[Anthony] In Marilyn, Greenson saw a woman who was deprived of childhood,
and he thought that what she needed was a family.
[Danny] In all the years he'd been doing that,
my father had never had a patient commit suicide.
He never treated anybody as unorthodoxly as he was treating her.
His feeling was that because of who she was, she could never be hospitalized.
So given that he couldn't do that,
his feeling was the best shot he had
was to try to treat her in this highly unusual,
unorthodox kind of way that he did.
She starts hanging out with the family.
That's how a sort of more of a friendliness then came about.
Before dinner, they would have cocktails.
And that would be where the sort of pre-dinner conversation would go on.
She had a… a mind that searched
and an honest mind that tried to find whatever her truths were.
[Danny] It must have been somewhere along the line that I began to talk to her.
And it was in that particular setting that I slowly but surely got to know her,
because I certainly know that my opinion changes.
Within that family, I was the new arrived left-winger.
So, but we'd get into these conversations,
and lo and behold, you know, Marilyn would end up on my side.
-[Anthony] Right. -[Danny] So a friendship developed.
I began to like her and to recognize that there was more to this person
than, uh… than met the eye.
[Joan] Well, Marilyn told me that there was a new man in her life.
[Anthony] And what did she have to say?
No, that he was just, you know… you know, really terrific.
No, that he was just, you know… you know, really terrific. -Neat. [laughs] -And he was really neat.
And, you know, cute and…
I mean, it was that kind of… I mean, I remember--
-It was girly talk. -[Joan] It was girly talk.
I mean, the… She said that this person was so important that she wouldn't tell me who it was.
Calling him "the general."
[Joan] She was calling him "the general."
-The general. -[tape clicks]
"The general."
The general was the way insiders at the Justice Department
referred to Attorney General Robert Kennedy.
[Joan] And I remember feeling that it was real…
You know, it was real peculiar that here I'm sitting with Marilyn Monroe.
We're talking about boyfriends, and I'm meeting some schlub at art school.
I know that she's talking about somebody that's very big in the government.
And… and it sort of struck me as… -[laughs] Somehow this is bizarre. -[Anthony] You mean, you knew already--
[Joan] So I didn't know whether it was Bobby or the president.
-[Anthony] Yeah. -[Hildi] It was simply titillating.
[Joan] I mean, I don't even remember the guy I had a crush on back then,
but it was certainly somebody that wasn't gonna hold a candle to that.
[Anthony] '61, in her last year and months.
Yeah.
[Anthony] The rumors about John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe are, of course, legion.
Robert Kennedy was another matter.
That was beginning to interest me more.
[Danny] There was more to this person than met the eye.
[Hildi] Family.
[Anthony] "Orphan girl rejections."
[Joan] The general.
This person was so important.
[Anthony] Question marks.
Mysteries.
Robert F. Kennedy maybe would fit into the pattern of the end of Marilyn's life.
After all,
from her mid-twenties, her romantic involvements
were with famous men.
[commentator] Joe DiMaggio! Smacked one out of the park!
What a hit! Into the upper deck in left center field!
[Marilyn] He was a wonderful athlete.
[commentator] DiMaggio connects.
[Marilyn] I met him… he had already retired.
[Marilyn] I had very few friends.
It's just that
I like people,
but for friends, I like few people.
But I think she was quite taken with DiMaggio.
[Marilyn] I saw him for around a year and a half, two years, and we married.
[announcer] Romance that thrills the world!
The marriage of Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio.
The girl who starred in How to Marry a Millionaire,
giving another starring performance in How to Marry a Baseball Hero,
and now the pair are off for their happy honeymoon.
[Marilyn] He understood some things about me, and…
I understood some things about him.
[Marilyn] We based our marriage on it.
And I say some things.
[reporter] How have you and Mrs. DiMaggio enjoyed your trip to Japan?
Everything has been fine. We've enjoyed our trip.
The only thing that I have to complain about is I haven't seen much of Marilyn.
She is making a trip to Korea,
touring through the camps and so,
maybe after that we'll be able to spend a little time together.
[Gloria] I mean, I really don't think they had a lot in common.
I think she was very touched by his genuine concern for her.
But then quite soon bored…
with his over-possessiveness.
[Marilyn] Well, we're here to make The Seven Year Itch.
-[reporter] That's your latest picture? -Yes.
I'm looking forward to working in it very much.
I hear that you're getting to be quite a cook too.
Joe says you can really broil a mean steak.
Well, I'm learning.
A little slow, but… [chuckles]
Okay.
[Anthony] Joe DiMaggio couldn't deal with being married to the nation's pin-up.
[Billy Wilder] We were shooting Seven Year Itch with Marilyn Monroe.
And do you remember that famous shot?
Do you remember the wind that is lifting her skirt?
Do you feel the breeze from the subway?
Isn't it delicious?
[Marilyn] Oh! Here comes another one!
[Wilder] Well, we were all set up to shoot that scene, you know.
There were five and ultimately 10,000 people.
They were like, uh… and look up Marilyn's skirt.
And…
people were heckling from the sidelines,
and people were running up for autographs.
[Anthony] You did Marilyn's hair on several of her films.
[woman] I did Seven Year Itch.
[Anthony] So you were around during that business
that caused the fuss with the skirt blowing up--
[Gladys] Yeah. Joe got very upset about it.
-[Anthony] Did he really or was that-- -[Gladys] Really!
[Wilder] Joe DiMaggio, you know, he was watching it, and he didn't like it very much,
his wife making a spectacle of herself.
[Gladys] They had a suite in a real old, beautiful hotel.
-And he… beat her up a little bit. -[Anthony] Huh.
[Gladys] Marilyn said that she screamed and yelled for us.
But we couldn't hear her through those thick walls, you know.
[Anthony] She emerged a bit bruised and black eyes and things?
-[Gladys] It was more on her shoulders. -[Anthony] Yeah.
But with a little makeup and everything, she went ahead and worked.
[Marilyn] Our marriage wasn't a happy one. It ended in,
uh, nine months,
unfortunately.
I don't know what else to say.
All I can say as her attorney is that
this is what we would say was a conflict of careers.
Has Joe moved out finally?
-[reporter] Okay, Jerry! -I'm sorry. I have to go.
[Danny] My dad had told me…
that she got depressed at times.
About how terrible she felt about herself.
[Anthony] Right.
"Nothing would ever turn out right."
"Nothing would go my way."
[Anthony] Right.
[reporter 1] How do you feel about coming back to Hollywood? A happy time for you--
Yes, it is. It's a very happy time. I'm happy to be back.
-In my hometown. -[reporter 1] Yes.
[reporter 2] Well, you're a happy girl now?
And she talked about this whole litany of depressive thought.
"Nobody likes me."
"Everything I do turns to shit."
"I don't have anybody."
"I'm a waif."
[reporter 2] Marilyn, all we know in New York
is that you and Joe DiMaggio are friends at a distance.
How great a distance?
Well, we haven't seen each other.
[reporter 2] Do you hear from each other? Do you write or talk?
-Um, I'd rather not answer. -[reporter 2] All right, fine.
[Marilyn] Well, when I was put in the orphans' home,
they pulled me, and I kept crying and screaming, "I'm not an orphan."
I called every woman I would see, I'd say, "There's a mama."
If I would see a man, I'd say, "There's a daddy."
[woman] I don't think I have really too much to say about it except
I… I liked her, and…
and we'd talk a lot.
[Anthony] Right.
[Feury] I was at the Strasbergs' parties with her a lot.
[Anthony] Did you see her in the time of her deterioration,
which was the last year or so. Did you--
[Feury] She… she seemed a little bit, um…
She seemed concerned about, uh,
you know, like childhood memories of…
of being molested as a child, things like that.
[Anthony] Talked about it as late as that?
[Feury] She talked about that, I remember.
She felt that she had avoided…
That she knew people who were psychotic from such episodes,
and she felt that at least she'd survived that.
Marilyn said, "It did happen."
"I knew it was wrong."
"But to tell you the truth, I think I was more curious than anything else."
"Nobody ever told me about sex."
"And frankly, I never did think it was all that important."
-[tape clicks] -[man] I was a very, very close friend.
And was friends to the end.
[Henry] She wanted to know her father so badly.
I remember a party and this game we'd play.
Everybody said what they'd want most in the world.
[Anthony] Yes.
[Henry] And she said she'd want to put on a black wig,
pick up her father at a bar,
have him make love to her,
and then she'd say, "Well, how does it feel now to have a daughter
that you've made love to?"
[Anthony] Yes.
[Danny] We all need to get out of childhood in one piece,
but if nowhere along the line do you get that sort of reinforcement
that you are worth love, you're lovable, that there's something in you,
that we're a good person,
what you end up with is a sort of emptiness.
[Anthony] Men, eminent men,
again,
powerful and important,
again and again,
if there's any mystery about Monroe's death,
seemed to me to be central.
[Anthony] Before jumping in at the deep end, I wanted to know,
did you see her just after the DiMaggio marriage?
We were friends prior to the marriage.
[Anthony] Yes.
Many years before that.
[Arthur] See, my father owned half of Republic Studios at one time.
-So I grew up with these people. -[Anthony] Uh-huh.
But, uh, I think the greatest effect of all was Arthur Miller.
[Anthony] Yes.
[Arthur] The Arthur Miller situation.
[Anthony] Arthur Miller was the nation's most famous playwright.
He was distinguished for his plays, like All My Sons and Death of a Salesman.
[reporter 1] How long have you known Miss Monroe, Mr. Miller?
I met her a long time ago, but I hadn't seen her in years.
But I think I've got the woman who is going to be my wife.
-[reporter 1] You mean Marilyn Monroe? -That's correct.
[reporter 2] When are you planning to have children?
Well, I'm not married yet, dear.
[reporter 3] This is a personal question.
Is there anything in particular about Mr. Miller that attracted you?
-Have you seen him? -[reporter 3] Yes.
-Yes! -[all laugh]
[Anthony] In 1955, Marilyn was 29,
and he was 40.
Their romance really took off.
I think she was quite intrigued by people she thought to be bright.
[Anthony] She was bright and trying to further herself in that sense all the time. Is that right?
in that sense all the time. Is that right?
[Feury] That would have been my impression.
[Anthony] Marilyn had come to crave artistic credibility and independence.
[Marilyn] What I'd like to accomplish, I would like to be a good actress.
A true actress. An artist, with integrity.
[Anthony] She'd moved to the East Coast,
studied at the famed Actors Studio and started her own production company,
Marilyn Monroe Productions.
[Feury] She had very strong goals for herself.
She was so bright about acting.
[Anthony] You saw her doing things out in the Studio?
[Feury] She'd come over, sit with me at the Studio and things like that.
She'd figure out what she wanted to do with the scene.
[Anthony] She really seems to have worked at things.
[Feury] She really… she really cared.
[Marilyn] I think love and work are the only things that really happen to us.
[Arthur] Arthur Miller thought she was intelligent
and had a brain that was never cultivated.
And that's where he courted her.
[Anthony hesitates] You mean that it was a Svengali situation?
-[Arthur] That's correct. -[Anthony inhales]
[Anthony] It was the coming celebrity wedding of the year, and it got enormous attention.
It all amounted to a new beginning.
[reporter] Ms. Monroe, could you tell us what kind of a wedding you're gonna have?
Very quiet, I hope.
[Anthony] The couple married in a quiet ceremony.
He gave her a ring inscribed,
"Now is forever."
Marilyn wrote on the back of one of the wedding photographs…
"Hope, hope, hope."
[Anthony] The couple traveled to London to make a film for Marilyn Monroe Productions,
The Prince and the Showgirl.
After a party,
she happened upon some notes that Arthur Miller had left lying around.
Marilyn told her acting coach,
"It was something about how disappointed he was in me."
"How he thought I was some kind of angel
but now he guessed he was wrong."
"He'd married a woman as flawed as his previous wife had been."
Miller also wrote in the note that she was a whore.
An incident that Marilyn would refer to time and again.
What does it mean?
She thought he wanted to love her, but…
how could she be protected against love's tenderness or brutality?
[man] Studio.
-[Anthony] Can I speak to Milton Greene? -[Milton] Speaking.
Good morning. It's Tony Summers.
The business with you,
I had gathered that you were her close friend and associate.
Close friend and associate. We loved each other, period.
[Anthony] Was it your impression that when she was actually married,
that she was pretty much of a good, faithful wife?
[Milton] She was. She really was. She wanted a baby.
In fact, during Prince and the Showgirl,
she said, when it's over, she's gonna go home and have a baby.
And I said, "Well, great."
"Get the white picket fence, and I think it's a good idea."
[Anthony] Yes.
Did she ever talk to you about her desire for children?
[Milton] If you gave her a choice between children and stardom,
it would have been children…
without question.
[Danny] There were some photographs,
I think it was a picture of her and Miller's father.
And she said to me,
"This is my happiest period."
And I asked her why.
She showed me the picture and said, "I was pregnant then."
[Henry] Yes, she was pregnant by Miller during Some Like It Hot.
♪ Running wild, lost control ♪ ♪ Running wild, mighty bold ♪
[man] If you watched her
in the picture that I worked with her on called Some Like It Hot…
-[Anthony] Right. One of my favorites. -[man] She was so wonderful.
[Anthony] How much of her career did you know her through?
All the way through.
-[Anthony] From the start? Gosh. -Yes.
[Sydney] She had a very naive quality about her, very soft, gentle quality.
-[Anthony] Yeah. -♪ Boop boop be doo ♪
[Sydney] That's the way she could be, you see.
[Sydney] That's the way she was, not could be. She was evanescent.
-♪ To anything higher… ♪ -And I…
Well, uh, she wasn't happy many times, Mr. Summers.
I… I remember…
[Anthony] I wonder if you're about to tell me about her problems with childbearing,
and she did lose the baby.
Uh, it seemed to me that the crises that are supposed to have occurred,
seem to have occurred because of her miscarriages.
Am I on the wrong track with that?
Everything connects in a person's life, particularly hers, you know?
And it's sad.
[Wilder] She was slightly discombobulated at all times.
But by God, when you suffered through that scene,
through the 30, 40, 50 takes sometimes,
you had something there, you know.
Something absolutely unique that cannot be duplicated.
I had no problem with Monroe. Monroe had problems with Monroe.
She had problems with herself.
[Sydney] I can give you the reason for that one.
But I can't say anything. And I knew it all.
I'm awfully sorry.
You sound very nice, but I really… It makes me unhappy to talk about it.
It really does.
-[Anthony] You know you-- -[Sydney] She's been gone 20 years…
-[Anthony] Oh yes. -…Mr. Summers.
[Anthony] I know.
[Sydney] I can't bring myself to talk about it.
[Marilyn] Just being able to be
another human being,
to be someplace…
Having certain kinds of secrets for yourself.
There is a need for aloneness, you know?
[Anthony] Presumably you were very abruptly aware of the decline
when you started The Misfits.
I was aware from the-- Yes, I was aware from the beginning.
And I saw there was something that she was…
She was not the fresh little girl that I'd known originally.
Very soon we were aware that she was a problem.
She'd be late on the set always.
Sometimes the whole morning would go by.
Sometimes she'd be all right.
Occasionally, she'd be practically non compos mentis.
[Anthony] Obviously the cause was the pills.
[Huston] The narcotics were the problem.
[Anthony] Many people abuse prescription drugs in Hollywood.
And Marilyn was no exception.
She used uppers, amphetamines, and downers, barbiturates for years.
And most dangerously, sleeping pills.
Did you account for it because her marriage was breaking up?
Was this upsetting her so deeply or…
[Huston hesitates] I discovered this in the course of the picture.
I remember saying to Miller one day…
I said, you know, that if she went on at the rate that she was going,
why, she'd be in an institution in two or three years, or dead!
And I said anyone who allows her to take a drug ought to be shot.
It was almost an accusation against him.
An indictment against Miller.
[Anthony] When did you last see her alive?
[Huston] At the end of the shooting of Misfits.
[Marilyn] Happiness…
Does one ever know that?
[Anthony] 1961…
That looks like any movie star being mobbed by reporters.
In fact, Marilyn spent four days at Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic
for treatment of her abuse of sleeping pills,
but the press had got wind of it.
[reporter] Marilyn!
[Anthony] And she came out of there through the mob of newsmen
and switches herself on
and looks fairly composed.
[reporter] Marilyn!
[Anthony] Marilyn was quoted as saying she felt wonderful.
I feel wonderful. Thank you.
[Anthony] The truth, though, this was a woman who'd been deeply emotionally distressed.
Just months later, she'd be dead.
Why?
[Anthony] She got divorced from Miller in January '61,
on the same day that the president was inaugurated.
[Hildi] Here she was now, again divorced and terribly lonely.
[Arthur] That's when the Kennedys came back in there.
[Anthony] After the collapse of her marriage to Miller?
-[Arthur] Right. -[applause]
-[Anthony] Were you aware of that? -[Arthur] Oh, yes.
But Jack, that started in the early and mid '50s.
[Anthony] It started way back in the '50s?
-Yes! -[Anthony] Uh-huh.
[Arthur] Oh, of course it did.
[Anthony] How early do you think you started hearing
any information at all about Marilyn and the Kennedys?
He'd been out here on and off all through the '50s.
'Cause he had lots of friends here, you know,
spending lots of time, you know.
-[Arthur] He used the Malibu Inn. -[Anthony] Yes.
-[Arthur] And drank at the Malibu Cottage. -[Anthony] Uh-huh.
The raunchiest looking thing you've ever seen in your life.
[Anthony] They actually got away with staying out there together and walking on the pier?
-Oh yeah, because Jack wasn't known… -[Anthony] Yeah.
…here at all.
He was a senator. He was totally unknown here.
I, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, do solemnly swear…
[Arthur] No one ever expected Jack to become the president or the nominee.
…and I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States.
[judge] And will to the best of your ability…
[Arthur] He's just some smart-ass rich kid's son that became senator.
Preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
So help you God.
So help me God.
[Anthony] So, when did the Bobby thing start?
[Arthur] After Jack.
[Anthony] But you did have the impression there had been,
in phase, relationships with both of them, did you?
Ah, yes.
[Anthony] Right.
[Arthur] Yes.
♪ Whose broad stripes And bright stars… ♪ [Arthur] But, in '61,
the meeting headquarters was at Pete Lawford's house.
In Malibu.
[Anthony] The palatial home of Peter Lawford and his wife Pat,
one of JFK's many sisters.
Peter Lawford was a member of Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack.
In 1961, Marilyn stayed the night here,
on occasion, with the Lawfords as their friend,
but also they threw famous parties here.
[Anthony] And at various points, the Kennedy brothers both came here.
[woman] Just the things that were going on in that beach house.
Not discreet at all.
Of course, there was nothing discreet about any of the Kennedys either.
[Anthony] Was Marilyn there when you were there with either of them? [Jeanne Martin] Mm-hmm. I mean, it was just mind-boggling.
[Jeanne Martin] Mm-hmm. I mean, it was just mind-boggling.
Peter would obviously be, you know, sort of pimping for both Kennedys.
They would do it just as soon in front of anybody.
Yeah, their wives could be in the other room,
and many times were, you know.
[Anthony] While jumping about with a lady in another room?
Yeah. I mean, I found a hand up my breast.
The president owned it. [scoffs]
[Anthony] Was Bobby a grabber?
Yeah.
Not in the terms that Jack was.
They were tacky, they were corny, they were… you know, the father was.
[Anthony] Oh yeah.
[Martin] They were chips off the old block.
[Anthony] And live up to Dad?
Ol' Joe Kennedy is well known for telling the boys,
"Get laid as often as you can with as many women as you want."
He actually told his boys that.
[Al] You know, his father was a bigger wolf than he was!
[Anthony] Oh, Joe. Yes.
He came out here, and he had an office here,
which later became RKO.
See, before, any con artist could come into the motion picture industry
and make a buck. [Anthony] Right.
And he used to fuck up in his office.
I used to have to wait outside the door, for chrissakes,
while he was getting laid.
I mean, I'm talking about Joe.
[Anthony laughs] Right.
So he still had power in Hollywood for years afterwards, did he? [Al] Yeah.
Remember that.
[Anthony] But was it your impression there was a Bobby thing then
or that there was a Jack thing then?
Both.
[Anthony] I mean, you would think the brothers sharing a lady…
I do.
[Danny] It was in the dining room one day,
and she was talking about going over to Lawford's house.
"I want something to talk to him about."
-[Anthony] Robert Kennedy? -Right.
-[Anthony] Robert Kennedy? -Right. We talked about some political questions. She actually ended up writing them down
We talked about some political questions. She actually ended up writing them down and putting them in her purse, and then she went there.
and putting them in her purse, and then she went there.
[Gloria] She was seated with Bobby
and had made some little notes,
feeling that she really wasn't quite bright enough for the crowd.
And, um, at one point,
he got up and called his father long-distance
to say that he was seated with Marilyn Monroe,
and would his father like to say hello to Marilyn.
-[Anthony] Who? -This is Bobby.
And I think he asked her to dance.
They did that.
[Anthony] And Bobby lasts well into the presidency, right?
[Arthur] Yes, that's what she said on numerous occasions.
Again, she just didn't lie. She just spoke quite openly.
[Anthony] What picture did she paint of the state of the Kennedy thing at that point?
[Arthur] Oh, nothing but love.
Nothing but admiration.
[Anthony] Yeah.
Whatever the exact nature of the Kennedy brothers' relationship with Marilyn,
they were playing with fire.
There were bitter enemies.
Those who wanted to get the dirt on Jack and Bobby Kennedy.
[interviewer] Tonight, we go after the story of a private detective,
who helps Confidential magazine pry into the lives of Hollywood stars.
An ex-cop, now one of the highest-paid private detectives in the United States.
He's Fred Otash.
Now then, Fred Otash, you take any case that pays you money, is that not so?
-Correct? -That's correct.
Any case at all?
I won't take a case for a member of the Communist Party or a communist.
I sort of draw the line there.
[interviewer] How do you justify invading people's privacy like that?
Well, I feel this way, if you can see it or hear it,
you're not invading any privacy.
Being a private detective is a dirty job. There's no two ways about it.
But I do a certain job,
and I try to determine if the facts and the items are true.
-[interviewer] You just want the facts? -That's right. The true facts.
-[Anthony] Fred Otash? -[Fred] Yeah.
It's Tony Summers here.
[Fred] I worked for and against the Mafia. I worked for and against law enforcement.
I worked for and against the White House.
And I worked for Hoffa.
[Anthony] Jimmy Hoffa.
Jimmy Hoffa was the leader of the Teamsters Union.
It's a truckers' union of the United States.
Famously corrupt, enormously powerful.
Very much connected with the Mafia.
[Fred] You can't be head of the Teamsters unless you're approved by the Mob.
Hoffa was the Mob.
[Anthony] Hoffa had been targeted by Robert Kennedy.
-[Robert] Where'd you get the money? -[Hoffa] What'd you say?
[Robert] Do you have any evidence of the $20,000 in cash?
-[Hoffa] No. -Did you receive any of this money?
I don't believe that I did.
[Robert] Suggest anything to you?
[lawyer] It doesn't suggest anything except the fact that you're trying again
[lawyer] It doesn't suggest anything except the fact that you're trying again to embarrass Hoffa. That's all.
[Fred] Hoffa, he had a vendetta for Bobby. Kennedy had a vendetta for Hoffa.
Mr. Hoffa, did you say, "That SOB. I'll break his back."
Figure of speech. I don't know who I was talking about. I don't know what you're talking about.
[Fred] Hoffa wanted to neutralize Kennedy.
[Anthony] They wanted to get Bobby.
He was the hated target because he was the attorney general.
What Hoffa wanted
was for me to develop a derogatory profile on Jack and Bobby Kennedy
and their relationships with Marilyn Monroe.
And the strategy that was agreed upon was to use electronic devices,
and the most logical place to set those devices was Peter Lawford's home in Malibu.
That was the Kennedy playground.
And wire up Marilyn's home…
in Brentwood.
[Joan] The house on the Helenas was the first piece of property that she
ever had owned in her whole life.
And my father encouraged the whole idea that
she alone as a person could own and put down roots and have her own place.
It was something that hadn't occurred to her.
And she was, you know, very excited about establishing her own sort of family.
What Pop wanted to do was to have her stand on her own two feet.
[Marilyn] But there is something in people, they want solitude for a while.
That I'm quiet and to myself more.
[Danny] Somewhere in there, my dad went away.
-[Anthony] Yeah. -[Danny] To Europe.
And he left with her in fairly decent shape.
But I think she was starting that movie.
[Anthony] That's right.
[Joan] In a sense, the less important we became in her life, the better off.
That meant that she had her own life.
-[man 1] All right, camera! -[man 2] It's 11.
It takes me two seconds. It's taken…
You've… you've had two days. Sorry, George, but we can do it.
[George Cukor] Good, good, good.
All right, cameras!
-[footsteps fading] -[Cukor indistinct]
Yeah, one more. That was good though, right?
[man] He thought very highly of her, George Cukor did.
And she would become even more of a star.
[Robin] I'd have to look into my journal and see what he said.
-If I wrote it down as a quote. -[Anthony] I'd be interested in that.
[Robin] This is a quote. "Marilyn will turn out to be
the most popular actress of her generation, probably of this century."
[man 1] 502. Speed.
[Marilyn] Mr. Cukor, on this film, has been
very wonderful to me.
Trying to be happy is almost as difficult as trying to be a good actress.
You have to work at both of them. [laughs]
[Robin] "Her best films would have come late in her career."
"She had a great untapped dramatic talent."
But anyway, she was making that movie, and… my dad, when he left said,
"You guys should try to pitch in."
He wanted to make sure that she wasn't running into some trouble.
There was always great danger that she might…
get involved with somebody or something.
[Anthony] Yes.
[Fred] The bugs were installed in the bedrooms and on the phones.
And there were four bugs altogether installed out there.
They were placed under carpets,
in the chandeliers, and in ceiling fixtures.
You could wire a telephone five miles from the location.
I had sent Danoff out there.
John Danoff.
[Anthony] 1961 being the year John Danoff was listening to Marilyn Monroe with JFK.
[Fred] Yes.
[Anthony] Testing, testing. Danoff, Danoff, Danoff.
[John Danoff] The conversation that came across the receiver,
it would fade in and fade out.
[John Danoff] Music, people talking,
and I'm then beginning to recognize the voices,
the Bostonian accent and Marilyn Monroe.
I heard the president call Marilyn "Marilyn,"
or Marilyn calling the president "Prez."
Any conversations on the phone,
some with Jack Kennedy, some with Bobby Kennedy, some with Monroe, some with other people.
Arrangements for meetings, there were gonna be rendezvous with Jack Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, and Monroe.
with Jack Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, and Monroe.
So there were numerous tapes made on Marilyn and Jack at the beach house
in the act of lovemaking.
[John Danoff] They went into the bedroom where there was another transmitter,
which picked up cuddly talk and taking off her clothes,
the sex act in the bed.
[Fred] And someone wired up Marilyn's house
on behalf of Hoffa.
Bobby Kennedy was there many times.
There were more tapes made out of Robert Kennedy and Monroe,
as opposed to Jack Kennedy and Monroe.
[Anthony] I managed to get to Bobby Kennedy's
personal secretary at the Justice Department.
[woman] This is in '62, shortly before her death.
It must have been that summer.
Whenever she called,
and I would always answer the attorney general's personal calls,
she would talk to me.
It was as though she were reaching out.
[Anthony] Right.
[Angie] And Bob would call her back, and they'd talk.
[Anthony] Oh, yes. Here it is.
An FBI file on Marilyn
that dealt with security matters,
national intelligence,
and the subject line, Marilyn Monroe SM-C,
for security matter, communist.
The FBI had long watched Marilyn,
especially at the time she was married to Arthur Miller,
who was supposed to be a communist and had joined up for a little while.
It was the middle of the Cold War.
[newscaster] The entire globe, yesterday, the site of a momentous conflict.
The conflict which has become known as the Cold War.
The long, dangerous standoff between the United States
and the communist Soviet Union.
[reporter 1] The Communist Bloc would like to see the world under communist domination.
[reporter 2] Recently, we've seen it extend into turbulent Cuba.
Does that disturb you? It should.
[Anthony] Nuclear war was a constant threat.
[reporter 3] You are in the crosshairs of the bombsight.
[host] A massive nuclear intercontinental capability.
The communist plan for world domination.
It is a contest unlike any we have ever faced in our history as a nation.
[Anthony] A March 1962 document,
during a trip to Mexico,
Marilyn spent time with friends,
known American communists and left-wingers.
They'd been kicked out of America.
She told one of them, Fred Vanderbilt Field,
of a talk she'd had with Bobby Kennedy about politics.
She'd mingled with communist American expats.
And FBI agents had been watching.
To the intelligence agencies,
the Kennedys' celebrity plaything,
a volatile creature running to her psychiatrist every day,
chattering on the telephone to all and sundry,
was absolutely the wrong woman
to be on intimate terms with the president and the attorney general.
[man] I remember when she sang for the president.
[Anthony] This was only a month or two before she died, of course.
[Henry] And she was so excited about it.
'Cause, "Why, the president of the United States," you know.
You know, it was one of the most exciting things of her life.
President is winding up his New York day here at Madison Square Garden
in a sort of pre-birthday celebration.
Mr. Kennedy has the best seat in the house at the function,
and it will be starting just about now, the finale for this affair.
Mr. President,
on this occasion of your birthday, this lovely lady, Marilyn Monroe.
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday, Mr. President ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ We thank you so much ♪
Everybody! Happy birthday!
[Henry] Just being the one to sing.
She was picked.
-[whirs, distorted voice] -[Henry] She was picked.
The one.
[Anthony] Two documents that make extraordinary reading.
On July the 13th, 1962,
an unnamed informant quoted Marilyn as saying she'd just days earlier
lunched with President Kennedy at Peter Lawford's house on the beach.
They had, she said, discussed the morality of atomic testing,
and Marilyn was described as positively and concisely leftist.
And they especially get in a state when Marilyn had spent time with Robert Kennedy
at the home of the Peter Lawfords in Hollywood.
He had been in California, had seen her there,
and then headed to Nevada
to witness a nuclear weapons test.
Now remember,
at that very time,
Cuba's Fidel Castro
was making urgent appeals to the Soviet Union for military help.
Khrushchev shipped ballistic missiles to Cuba,
dozens of miles from Florida.
Nuclear matters were the dominating international issue…
and they were just loose-lipped.
They were bloody idiots, weren't they?
Because she was in touch with people who were regarded as communist,
all of whom were talking to Fidel Castro's people.
The political risk was extreme.
This is very possibly the thing to which the Kennedys said,
"Shit."
"She can make public that we've been discussing nuclear matters
at this critical time."
"We've got to stop all this."
"We can't deal with Marilyn Monroe anymore."
[Arthur] We met in Laguna.
[Arthur] A month before she died.
[Anthony] Was that just for supper or something?
She came down for the weekend.
And… she told us the…
What had really taken place with the Kennedys.
[Arthur] I can… You know, I can go into the dirt, or I can go into lots of other things, but she… She was…
but she… She was… She was, uh, hurt.
Terribly hurt when… [hesitates] …she was told directly
never to call or contact again.
[Anthony] Not to talk to Robert anymore?
-Robert or John. -[Anthony] Right.
They had both said, "That's it. No more"?
[Arthur] Well, no, that was an order.
[Anthony] But both of them had said to her, "That's the end of it"?
-[Arthur] No, Jack didn't contact her. -[Anthony] Yeah.
[Arthur] Bob did.
[Anthony] I see.
[Arthur] And that's what killed her.
[Arthur] I don't care what anyone else says.
It was the beginning of the last day, if you will.
[Anthony] How did she seem?
[Gloria] Prior to her death?
-[Anthony] Yeah. -[Gloria] Uh…
She had been mixing drink and sleeping pills.
[Anthony] I find varying accounts. She was really on the downward path.
I thought she very definitely was on the downward path.
And I just never could quite understand whether
she understood there was help to be had
and people did care about her.
And whether she was just…
letting go.
[Marilyn] I like to stay here and now.
Fame is fickle.
It had its compensation.
But… it also has its drawbacks.
And I know it.
I've had you, fame.
So long!
[announcer 1] One of the most famous stars in Hollywood history is dead at 36.
[reporter] Her housekeeper, Eunice Murray,
found the actress dead in bed,
holding in one hand a telephone, which was off its hook.
Bottle of sleeping pills near her bed.
[announcer 2] No notes were found.
[announcer 3] The coroner ruled the cause of death an overdose of drugs.
It is our opinion, probable suicide.
Well, the official finding will never tell the story
of her life and end.
[Anthony] Marilyn Monroe's death was just a huge event,
pages and pages and pages.
Question marks.
Dig, dig, dig.
Over two years.
Hollywood,
Los Angeles,
the bugging, the eavesdropping.
Had she been murdered?
John F. Kennedy,
Robert Kennedy,
Jimmy Hoffa.
Rumor.
White House files, FBI files.
Honesty.
Assembling the facts.
And…
Marilyn's death.
Focus, focus, focus.
The public version of the story,
the accepted version in 1962,
turns on the word of Mrs. Murray,
Marilyn's housekeeper, and of Dr. Greenson.
On Saturday, August 4th, her final day alive,
at about 8:00 p.m., according to Mrs. Murray,
Marilyn went into her bedroom and closed the door.
Then perhaps sometime after 3:00 a.m.,
she woke to find the light still on.
The door, Mrs. Murray said, was locked.
Worried, she phoned psychiatrist Greenson.
He got up and drove the mile and a half to Marilyn's house.
According to him, he then managed to peer through a window
to see Marilyn lying facedown on the bed.
Having broken a window and climbed in, Greenson said, he had told Mrs. Murray,
"We've lost her."
They called the police, according to police records, at 4:25 a.m.
4:25.
The original timeline has been a fixed point of the official story,
but I had significant breakthroughs on that front.
The biggest breakthrough I had was when I got to the widow of Arthur Jacobs,
the man who ran Marilyn Monroe's public relations.
Natalie Jacobs told me that that evening,
she and her husband had been at the Hollywood Bowl
listening to a Henry Mancini concert.
[Natalie] I will never forget that night
because we were at the Hollywood Bowl,
and someone, I don't know who it was, that came to us,
and all I remember is that we were no longer
at the Hollywood Bowl, if you know what I mean.
[Anthony] Yes. So when would you think you heard the news and had to leave the Bowl?
About half past ten.
[Anthony] And you then left and went home, and he went to Marilyn's place?
-Exactly. -[Anthony] Right.
An attendant had come and called her husband from the auditorium
and brought him to the telephone
because something was terribly wrong at Marilyn Monroe's house.
Now, how does one account for the fact that
the housekeeper is supposed to have called Dr. Greenson,
and he is supposed to have got in at 3:30 in the morning
and found Marilyn lying dead on the bed,
nobody else in the house except the housekeeper?
That's not true because my husband was there.
[Anthony] Yes, and had been there for some hours by that time.
That's correct.
-[Anthony] Remember, the official story-- -My husband fudged everything off.
-[Anthony] Remember, the official story-- -My husband fudged everything off. [Anthony] Ah.
I cannot tell you why because he's no longer with us, as you know.
-[Anthony] He didn't tell you why-- -Don't forget, that was his business.
To keep the press at bay. He kept everyone in abeyance.
The important thing is that she stresses that this was well before midnight.
I found corroboration for what Natalie Jacobs had told me.
A member of Arthur Jacobs' staff, Juliet Roswell.
And I find my original handwritten note,
um, in which she says that Jacobs did say,
"I went out to Monroe's house at eleven o'clock at night."
You couldn't have Mrs. Murray, the housekeeper, finding Marilyn dead
at three o'clock in the morning
and also Arthur Jacobs being called away from the concert as early as eleven o'clock.
What was going on at the house between 11:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m.?
Clearly a key question. And in the end, we got answers to it.
I found the DA had been contacted by a former ambulance man.
And he said that he'd been aboard an ambulance
that had gone to Marilyn Monroe's house that night.
-[DA] What happened? -[man] What do you mean?
[DA] Did you go into the house?
-[Ken] Yeah. -[DA] Did you see Monroe's body?
[Ken] Yeah, she was on the bed.
[DA] Do you recall whether she was on her back or stomach?
[Ken] Side.
-[DA] She was on her side. -[Ken] Yes.
[Anthony] His allegation stood all by itself.
So I made my way to the offices of Schaefer Ambulance
and talked to Mr. Schaefer himself, Walt Schaefer.
[Anthony] Forgive me troubling you. I talked to Ken Hunter, who used to drive for you.
[Walt] Yeah?
[Anthony] And Ken Hunter said one of your ambulances was called, what, during the night?
-[Walt] Yeah. -[Anthony] Do you know where it took her?
[Walt] Took her to Santa Monica emergency.
[Anthony] Now the reason that puzzled me
was that according to all the public reports,
in the end she was dead at home.
[Walt] No, she wasn't.
[Anthony] Your impression is she was alive but presumably somewhat comatose.
[Walt] Yes, that's right.
[Anthony] I mean, you're quite certain? You'd put money on it?
[Walt] Yeah.
[Anthony] She was picked up and taken,
-comatose, to the hospital… -[Walt] Right.
…and that was the end so far as Schaefer's were concerned?
[Walt] It's the truth.
And what's more, I found no less than seven members of Schaefer Ambulance,
who corroborated the notion that she had been carried that night.
And this is a huge development in the story.
But then, it would have been between the two drivers and--
-[Walt] The other people involved. -[Anthony] Involved.
[Walt] I don't know who was involved.
[Anthony] Could you just summarize for me what Greenson told you
[Anthony] Could you just summarize for me what Greenson told you and when it probably was that he told you it?
Greenson and I were both at a… at a lunch.
I was sitting next to him at the table.
-[Anthony] Yes. -[Sherlock] And…
This is after she died. '64, somewhere like that.
Quite closely related to her death.
[Anthony] The question was whether she died in the ambulance
[Anthony] The question was whether she died in the ambulance or whether she got to the hospital,
and as I remember, Greenson told you that, yes, she'd been taken away by ambulance
and that she got to a hospital. Isn't that right?
They took her to St. John's.
[Anthony] St. John's Hospital. Just recap on it for me.
And that she died in the ambulance.
Then they took her back to the house. That was what he told me.
[Anthony] She died on the way, and the ambulance brought her body back.
[Sherlock] Right…
[Anthony] Greenson didn't say he was with the ambulance, did he?
[Sherlock] Yeah, he did! He told me that he was in the ambulance.
[Anthony] But he never reflected any of that to you?
Um…
Yeah, I just don't feel comfortable telling you what he told me.
[Anthony] I mean, about, for instance, that weekend when it had happened.
She died.
This sort of thing was not talked about.
-People of that magnitude. -[Hildi] Yeah.
Also, he wouldn't want to burden me with
a knowledge that I would then have to hide.
[Anthony] Who was actually at the house?
And what were they doing? Why were they there?
[man] Hello?
Hello, Bill Woodfield?
[Bill] Yes.
[Anthony] Hi, evening. Um…
[Bill] I don't want to go through it with Marilyn again because, uh…
[Anthony] I respect that the journalism that you did in two or three days,
and which it appears to me, nobody else tried seriously to do
or has done since--
Listen, I don't know really anything else that I feel that I ought to do.
[Anthony] I would like you--
-Tony! -[Anthony] Yeah?
This has not had any interest for me in a long time.
I went in, did my number, took my money and got out of the business!
[Anthony] I would frankly like you on board in some way.
Find out where Bobby Kennedy was that weekend.
[Anthony inhales] Yeah.
It's January the 24th, 1984,
in the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles with Harry Hall.
[Harry] Do you wanna ask me something or--
[Anthony] Yes, I thought maybe I'd kick you off.
You said yesterday that you knew something about the events.
Did you learn anything about Bobby's movements the weekend Marilyn died?
Yeah, I had heard,
on good authority, that the Saturday that this happened,
Bobby had come into town.
Bobby was in town and supposedly left.
And when I say I heard it, I heard it from a federal agent.
[Anthony] Can you tell me which agency?
[Harry] Yes. It was definitely from the FBI.
[Anthony] Were you aware that Bobby was in town?
I think he was at Peter's house at the beach.
[Anthony] Yes.
Yeah, that's what I…
In fact, I… [hesitates] I must say, yes, I… I do remember that.
-He was. -[Anthony] Right.
-He was at Peter's house at the beach. -[Anthony] Right.
Somebody said the guy you certainly need to speak to is a guy called Reed Wilson.
The only thing is that he won't talk to you.
Wilson was renowned in government and business circles
as one of the most effective, discreet eavesdropping operatives
in the United States.
He was working directly for Fred Otash.
Last week, I did go to see him, Fred Otash.
And no sooner had I sat down at his table
than he said, "Have you been talking to Reed Wilson?"
[Reed] Well, I hope your phone is clean.
[Anthony laughs] I hope so too. Yes.
-[Reed] Which is a good question. -[Anthony] Yes.
Did Freddy, uh, cooperate? And if you don't wanna tell me, okay.
But I can call Fred. He'll tell me.
[Anthony] He said that Reed, in my experience, had never been known to be a liar.
Well, you're talking to a lot of people, and, you know,
you're obviously really intent on getting into this thing.
[Anthony] It was difficult to get to him.
I had to meet him at various locations
at points when he didn't show up, but I knew that I was being watched.
And eventually came close to getting his full confidence.
So I'm not at all of the mind of the loony people
who write books saying she was murdered.
[Reed] That Marilyn was murdered is baloney.
[Anthony] Straighten me out a bit.
-[Reed] I'll put you straight on it. -[Anthony] Yeah.
[Reed] First of all, what did Freddy tell you?
[Anthony] He said…
There were tapes recorded the day of her death.
[Anthony] Right.
Bobby Kennedy called her the night of her death from Lawford's house.
And she said, you know, "Don't bother me. Leave me alone. Stay out of my life."
A very violent argument, that, you know, "I feel passed around, I feel used,
I feel like a piece of meat."
[Anthony] He said he thought shenanigans
got Monroe in a terrible state of mind before she died.
[Reed] Now, that's true.
-What you just said is true. -[Anthony] Right.
She was raising a stink,
calling the broth… Calling John and the White House
and complaining about the situation.
-[Anthony] Because of the brother. -[Reed] Yes. The picture that I remember
is that she'd been hot and heavy for… for Bob.
-[Anthony] Yes. -[Reed] At first.
And then, she'd gotten the cold shoulder, or somehow or other, it had turned.
-Now the details of that, I don't know. -[Anthony] Right.
[Reed] But she had come to the point where she felt like
-she was just being used. -[Anthony] Yes.
[Reed] And that's where it was at about the time the end came.
-[Anthony] Right. -[Reed] She was upset and heartbro…
I don't know whether-- I don't think she was heartbroken.
I don't think that it was a thing of being heartbroken.
It was a thing of feeling taken advantage of and feeling
a lot of lies and feeling that she was just being…
Had come to where she said, you know, "I don't even want to see you."
You know, and, "Why did you come here?"
You know, "If you want to see me, you come to see me."
-You know, "I'm not coming down there." -[Anthony] Right.
The call to the White House thing,
I understood it to mean that, like she was calling to say, you know,
"Get your brother away from me. I hate all of you."
-That type of thing. -[Anthony] Right.
[Reed] There was a turning point in her feelings.
[Anthony] Right.
Like a piece of meat, used, passed around.
[Anthony] Eminent men… again.
[Reed] I don't think she was heartbroken.
Feeling used.
[Anthony] Again and again.
-[Reed] "I hate all of you." -[tape clicks]
[woman] I appreciate very much your calling. I think about you once in a while.
[Eunice] The Kennedys were a very important part of Marilyn's life.
I wasn't included in this information, but I was a witness to what was happening.
[Anthony] And he was here that day?
-[Eunice] Oh, sure. -[Anthony] That afternoon?
[Eunice] Yes.
And it became so sticky
that the protectors of Robert Kennedy, you know,
had to step in there and protect him.
[Anthony] Was it your impression there was any kind of FBI investigation of her death?
Not an investigation, but rather a "hush-hush."
Because the man that really was involved was the boss.
He was the attorney general, so he could have the FBI do anything.
People that knew,
they knew that they didn't want Bobby Kennedy's name brought into this,
again, because his brother was president.
They had done everything to hush this up.
[Anthony] Billy Woodfield,
one of the reporters working on the case, in the days following her death, got lucky.
[Bill] We sort of started to piece together what happened.
Press accounts were coming out, and they didn't make a lot of sense to us.
And so we started playing detective.
I pieced together the notion that a helicopter was used
and went out to see a helicopter pilot.
And I said, "Can I look at your log? Have you got a log?"
And he said, "Sure!" And he produced his log, and I started thumbing through it.
And I saw an entry that said
that he took Kennedy to meet a flight en route to San Francisco.
[Anthony] And the time roughly is--
Two or three in the morning. [Anthony] And apart from seeing the log, you mentioned it to him,
and he said, "Yes, I did that."
-[Bill] Yeah. -[Anthony] Yeah.
And he confirmed that he'd done that one that night. Yeah.
You called in to The Herald Tribune, and they called back and said, no--
Well, also a call was made to Bobby Kennedy's people.
[Anthony] You were trying to confirm that he had been in town.
That's right, and that he had been at the beach house and that he had flown out.
That that was one reason for the delay.
The message we got back was that Kennedy
would appreciate it if we didn't do the story.
We decided that we would not go with the story.
[Reed] Uh… What did Freddy tell you about that?
[Anthony] He talked to me about the middle of the night tale, you know?
[Reed] But I mean, the only people that would know about that
would be the people at the meeting.
[Anthony] That's right.
In the early dawn hours after Marilyn was found dead,
ironically, Wilson had been hired with Otash by Lawford
to clear her house of information that might compromise the Kennedys.
Lawford showed up completely disorientated and in a state of shock, saying that Marilyn Monroe was dead,
and in a state of shock, saying that Marilyn Monroe was dead,
that Bobby Kennedy was there,
that they had gotten in a big fight,
that he was spirited out of town back up north,
and that he'd like to have me make arrangements
to have someone go out to the house
and pick up any and all information
that was possible regarding any involvement
between Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedys.
He was convinced there was diaries around and maybe a note.
[Anthony] There's only one surviving photograph of Marilyn with the Kennedy brothers.
It was taken at a party
following the star-studded extravaganza for JFK at Madison Square Garden.
Other photos would be seized from at least one picture agency
shortly after Marilyn's death
by men claiming to be FBI.
And also the covert recordings of Marilyn and each of the Kennedy brothers
may have been seized by law enforcement.
Can I speak to Jim Doyle, please?
-[woman] One moment, please. -Doyle.
[Anthony] As far as the actual records being removed,
you were aware of that from your colleagues?
-[Jim] Yes. -[Anthony] This had occurred?
-[Jim] Oh yeah. It did happen. -[Anthony] Right.
[Jim] I was there at the time when she died.
There were some people there that normally wouldn't have been there.
-[Anthony] Bureau people? -[Jim] Yes.
[Anthony] Are you aware how long afterwards they came on the scene?
[Jim] Immediately. Before anybody even realized what had happened.
It had to be instructions from someone high up, higher than Hoover.
[Anthony] Schoolboy question, who's higher than Hoover?
-[Jim] The general or the president. -[Anthony] Yes.
[Jim] The only two.
[Anthony] Yes.
There have been several conspiracy stories.
There are people, on very thin evidence,
I think largely made-up evidence, who suggest that
people wanted to hide the precise circumstances of her death
because Marilyn was murdered.
Although I made a lot of progress in the work
Although I made a lot of progress in the work and indeed found out things to do with her dying
and indeed found out things to do with her dying and the circumstances of her dying, which had not been found out before,
and the circumstances of her dying, which had not been found out before,
I did not find out anything that
convinced me that she had been deliberately killed.
She died committing suicide
or taking a huge accidental overdose of drugs.
But I did find evidence the circumstances of her death
had been deliberately covered up.
If you then say to me, why were those circumstances covered up?
I would say that the evidence suggests it was covered up
I would say that the evidence suggests it was covered up because of her connection with the Kennedy brothers.
because of her connection with the Kennedy brothers.
[Reed] She was raising a stink.
She was…
She…
[Anthony] In 1982,
following a district attorney's review of the case,
the original finding remained unchanged.
[man] Well, as far as the Los Angeles District Attorney is concerned,
she killed herself, either on purpose or accidentally.
The Marilyn Monroe case is closed.
[Marilyn] The true things rarely get into circulation.
It's usually the false things.
It's hard to know where to start if you don't start with the truth.
[Anthony] The Kennedys' brother-in-law, actor Peter Lawford,
that key character in the cover-up,
he agreed to talk to me.
Just a shadow of the man that he had once been.
Lost.
[Lawford] I checked the operator for…
-Out of order. -[Anthony] Hmm.
[Lawford] The operator said the phone's off the hook.
Hey, it's all right. Forget it. Let's have a drink.
[Lawford] She was dead…
I've had to live with it…
I should have got in my car and gone up there.
[voice breaks] I should have known better.
[Marilyn] When I was a kid,
sitting in the front row…
at the movies on Saturday afternoon…
and I'd think how wonderful it would be to be an actress.
Everything that I would see.
And…
I…
[woman] A chance to slip away from waking life
to a world with no consequence.
-But that's not true. -[haunting choral music playing]
[woman] Your dreams don't just happen.
We make them happen.
And we design them with care just for you.
We have our reasons, and we have our rules.
We make your dreams to help you on your journey.
And where this one's going, she's gonna need all the help she can get.
[exhales] Good morning, Pig.
-Morning, Bugsy. -[Bugsy squawks]
-[Dad grunting] -[girl] Hey, Dad. What'd you get?
[sighs] Many leagues have I traveled across the sea to bring you breakfast.
Oh. Thank you. Here. Here, let me help you with that.
-Is that better? -Thank you. -Yeah. -[Dad grunts]
-Hey, Bugsy! -[Bugsy squawks]
[Dad] All right.
Batter up.
And… batter up.
-[breeze blowing] -[Dad] We on course, kiddo?
[girl] The wind's come around.
So what're you gonna do?
Bow up.
-[tiller squeaks] -Bow up.
-[wrench straining] -A little more. Little more.
[Dad] Here ya go, kiddo.
His name is Fred.
Oh, hi, Fred.
And I've got Seymour.
Dad, why do I have to learn math
if I'm gonna take care of the lighthouse, like you?
I already know everything there is to know about the lighthouse anyway.
Answer me this question.
What is a lighthouse for?
To keep ships safe.
[Dad] No. That's not what it's for.
But when you can answer that question…
I'll give you the key to the lighthouse, and that's a promise.
-[girl gasps softly] -[Dad] Now, bed.
You don't want Pig?
[clicks tongue] I am 11.
Well, sorry, Pig. It's a rite of passage.
Hmm?
What's that?
Oh, no. No, you don't have to worry. I'll still be here for you.
All right. Well, good night.
Wait!
-[Dad] Hmm? -One story?
-Flip story? -[girl gasps excitedly]
All right.
I got one you never heard before.
As you know, Flip and I, we lived the outlaw life. Hmm?
Hunting treasure every night, and… eh, what have you.
Now, one day ol' Flippy comes up to me, and he says, "Guess what I've heard."
[quietly] He's heard about these Pearls. Magic Pearls.
You get one of these Pearls, and you can wish for whatever you want.
The trouble was that these Pearls can only be found
in the most dangerous waters known to mankind.
-[eerie music playing] -The Sea of Nightmares.
Well, soon as I heard that, I was all, "Count me out. I don't want anything to do with it."
Then, of course, Flip, you know him, he goes and he does… the Double-Knock.
And when your partner does the Double-Knock--
-You can't refuse. -[Dad] That's right.
[both] Outlaw Code.
Set sail, we did.
Well, I tell you what, it was cold. It was mighty cold.
But I was thinking, well, in that kind of climate, Flip might not smell so bad.
Then the storm came.
[softly] And the waves.
-Suddenly there was this rumbling sound. -[thunder rumbles]
-It was all around us. -[floorboards creak]
-[Dad] And it grew louder by the second. -[wind picks up]
[Dad] It was the biggest, deadliest whirlpool I'd ever seen.
That boom swung around, hit me on the backside,
and tossed me into that water.
And down I went, like a lead weight.
Down… and down,
until I noticed there was a hole right there in the bottom of the sea.
So I swam in.
What's on the other side?
It's a dead place.
No life of any kind,
just littered with bones of ancient sea creatures.
That's when it came for me.
The monster.
-It rose up out of the darkness. -[low growling]
[Dad] Black as night, and bigger than any creature I had ever seen.
With long, smoky, inky tentacles.
I was frozen in fear.
And it just, kind of slowly…
-[distorted] …slowly… -[monster snarls]
…reached out and grabbed me and shook me for all I was worth! And I take-- -[alarm beeping] -[man speaking on radio]
Stand by.
-[radio chatter continues] -Wait, you can't stop now.
What? You mean during the scary part?
-It wasn't scary. -[Dad] Mm-hmm.
It was a potentially interesting start to a story.
-[Dad] Go for Peter. -Potentially… interesting start.
[Peter] Copy.
-[indistinct radio chatter] -[Peter] Nemo, listen to me. There's a fishing boat off Lopez that's in trouble.
It's gonna get bad out there tonight.
Listen, you know what to do if the power goes out, right?
Fire up the backup generator, clear the sump pump, radio Carla if there's a problem.
clear the sump pump, radio Carla if there's a problem.
[giggling] I got it, Dad.
Sweet dreams.
Hey… I got you.
[inhales sharply] Stop.
Good night.
[Peter] Good night. I'll be back soon.
[echoing] Dad?
Help! Help!
Help!
[frantically] Help!
Help!
Carla?
[Nemo] Carla, where's my dad?
Nemo,
he's gone, honey.
He's gone.
[shakily] I'm sorry.
-[Nemo crying] -[Carla] Those were his wishes. Did he talk with you about any of this?
Her mother died when she was a baby, so she's used to a single-parent household.
She doesn't have anybody else.
It's you, or she becomes a ward of the state.
They'll stick her in a group home or in foster…
Nemo, do you remember your uncle?
No. I've never met him before.
Your dad left instructions.
If anything ever happened to him…
he wanted you to go and stay with your uncle in the city.
But I have to take care of the lighthouse.
Nemo, you can't live alone.
But I can do it. I know how. He's taught me everything.
-[Carla] I'm sorry, honey. -[Nemo breathing shakily]
[man] "For tho' from out our bourne Of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far"
"I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crost the bar"
[softly] That's him.
[quietly] Hello?
No, it's not a good time.
My uh… My brother was lost at sea.
Mm. No, lost lost. Like, I'm at his funeral.
We were estranged, actually.
Estranged.
I'm… I'm happy with my plan.
-Carla. -Hello.
Hello.
[sighs] I'm so sorry for your loss.
Our loss, obviously.
Um, we can…
We better hit the road if we're gonna catch the ferry.
-[horn honks] -Uh, no shoes on the carpet.
-Oh, I'm sorry. -No…
It's a great building.
You never have to leave. [chuckles]
Which I basically never do 'cause I work from home.
Sorry.
There's a dry cleaner's, a coffee shop.
They even have a, um… a spinning studio downstairs.
Are you into spinning?
Like spinning around?
I don't know. I… I've never tried it.
Hey… [spluttering]
Do you like doorknobs?
These are my babies.
You're a doorknob salesman?
[scoffs] I'm not… I'm not a doorknob salesman.
I own a company that sells doorknobs.
We sell latches. We sell escutcheons.
Here's where we differ.
A lot of the glamour boys in the industry, they chase the latest trends, not us.
No, thank you. We'll stick with the classics.
'Cause it's security. It's not fashion.
-Don't touch that. -Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That's not a toy.
This is an antique.
Came from a prison cell in Alcatraz.
In case I need to lock you in your room. [chuckles]
I-- I-- I'm not gonna lock you in your room.
That was… humor.
[splutters] Do you need a hug or whatever?
No.
Well, good night.
[Nemo, softly] I know, Pig. I wish we could be with him again too.
Pig.
-What? -[Pig oinks]
Wait!
-[Pig grunts, squeals] -No.
[Nemo] Don't! Stop, stop! Wait!
Stop! Pause. Pause. Pause. Pause.
No! No, no, no! No! [gasps]
Stop! Stop! No, no, no, no, no! No! No!
[Nemo] Red light. Stop!
-[tapping] Red light! -[Pig oinks]
-Come on, Pig. -[Pig squealing]
-[taps] Thanks. -[Pig grunts]
-[Nemo] Hi, Bugsy. -[Bugsy caws]
Dad?
-[loud thumping upstairs] -Dad?
Dad?
Who are you?
Nobody? [laughs nervously]
I'm just one of those weird things that happens in dreams.
Ignore me. I'm leaving now. [high-pitched] Aww!
[man, high-pitched] Come back later. We're doin' dishes.
[gruffly] 'Kay, so that didn't work.
So, you're the kid.
What are you doing here?
And where's my dad?
[scoffs] Nobody told you?
I know what happened.
[sighs, grunts] Well, your dad and I were partners a long time ago,
before he went straight and had a kid.
Big mistake, in my opinion. [chuckles slightly, sighs deeply]
[snarling] Mad, bad, and dangerous to know.
Named Flip.
-You're Flip? -[grunts softly] Yeah.
I thought you were something my dad made up,
and you're different than I imagined.
Handsomer?
More "gorgeous-er," if you will?
Hairier.
-And… [sniffs] …smellier. -[Flip] Hmm.
I mean, I know you're not real,
but I always pictured, like, a normal human being.
Okay, you just said like four insulting things on top of each other.
Rude.
-Listen, I just came to pay my respects. -[fly buzzes, splats]
[chewing] Sorry for your loss. Hi-yah!
By ripping my dad's room apart?
Oh, that reminds me…
[chuckling] …your dad, he had a map.
About this big. Weird shapes and lines all over it.
Picture with an oyster with a pearl on the back of it.
It's one-of-a-kind, kid. We risked our lives stealing it.
-I never saw any map like that. -[Flip] Don't lie to me, kid!
Your dad would want me to have it.
I'm not lying.
Never mind, I'll find it myself. [blows a raspberry]
Hey, you can't just bust in here like some kind of thief.
-You say thief like it's a bad thing. -[glass shatters]
A thief just takes things that don't belong to them.
You can't take things from other people's dreams.
[scoffs] Sure you can. Ya just gotta know how to get in and get out.
I'm in your dream.
You're just a figment of my imagination.
You wish you could dream up somethin' this good. Look at that.
Mm! I look good.
Please! I don't want you here.
I just want my dad.
[smacks lips] Okay.
What if there is a way you can see your dad again?
What do you mean?
I'm goin' on a little treasure hunt, and this treasure… is magic.
Lets you wish for whatever you want here in Slumberland.
I could see my dad again.
Oh, yeah, you can see your dad again. Right here, every night.
But I'm gonna need that map, kid.
-[tense music playing] -I don't know what you're talking about.
[sucks teeth] Yeah, I believe you.
Hey, wait! I can try to find the map. I can still come with you.
Oh, that sounds super fun.
Except you got no gear, no skills,
and without the map… oh, you're useless to me.
-[Nemo gasps] -Time to wake up, kid.
A map.
Oh, you're up already. Good.
What are you doin'?
What's the weirdest dream you've ever had?
I don't remember my dreams.
Don't actually think I have any.
I brought you some milk, right?
Are you, uh, excited for your first day of school?
School?
[Uncle] This place should be amazing. It costs a fortune.
My dad said schools are basically prisons.
They keep kids locked up physically and mentally,
prepare them for jobs that are also basically prisons,
until they retire and go to a nursing home.
Their final prison.
School is not a prison.
Can I leave whenever I want to?
It's a little like a prison.
Bell doesn't help.
Nemo, hi. Welcome to Westbrook.
-I am Ms. Arya, lower school counselor. -Hey. Hi.
Well, I know what a… a difficult time this is but, um…
Hey, do you know what the most resilient thing on earth is?
It's not titanium.
Is it tungsten? It has a higher tensile strength--
The human spirit.
Oh, you mean metaphorically.
What you're going through, it's hard. But you know what?
You are stronger than you know.
Hey, can we talk for a sec?
-Oh, yeah. -Just one sec. Uh…
I, uh, just wanted to prepare you.
[quietly] Nemo's dad kinda raised her like a hermit.
Not in a bad way, just… you have your work cut out for you.
She… She's gonna need a lot of emotional support.
Yeah. I mean, I'm hoping that you guys can help with all that.
Oh. Well, we can't do that all by ourselves. -No. -[both chuckle]
-Right? -Right. Obviously.
Is that not something you do?
Look, I don't know how to take care of a little kid or talk about feelings.
Now, I think that she would be better off literally anywhere else.
[softly] Okay.
Oh, you have my hands.
You are capable of more than you think.
-[chuckles] Truly. You just gotta… -[chuckles lightly]
You just gotta connect with a part of yourself that you're not used to accessing.
Right.
You just gotta connect with her.
-Just try. -Okay.
-[door opens] -Hi, everyone. Hi. [quietly] Thanks, Ms. Young.
Hi, guys. How's everybody doing?
This is Nemo. She's gonna be joining your class.
So if you could all just make her feel right at home,
I would be so grateful.
Sorry.
Okay, everyone. Listen up.
In a victory for planet Earth,
we got compostable utensils in the cafeteria.
We won!
Hmm. Uh, Nemo, Jamal. -Jamal, Nemo. -[Jamal] It's a seven-day cycle.
-Jamal, Nemo. -[Jamal] It's a seven-day cycle.
You're late, you get a blue dot.
Three blues, and you get a red dot, and your parents get a notification.
And you can get the app for your phone.
I don't have a phone.
That is refreshing.
You're gonna need the app, though.
Any clubs you're into?
I'm on recycling team, Model UN, ceramics club, Pop-Tarts, that's our improv group,
lawn bowling, Slavic chorus, orchestra, woodworking, ultimate Frisbee…
Where'd you go to school before this?
I didn't. I was homeschooled.
Um, my dad and I lived in a lighthouse.
A lighthouse? That sounds awesome.
Why'd you move here?
My…
My dad's on a trip. That's why I'm here.
I'm staying with my uncle, just temporarily.
Oh. Cool.
Those are my Undeadheads.
We dress up as zombies and watch zombie movies.
It's cooler than it sounds… I think.
Uh, come sit with us.
Um, I… I need to do my math.
[Jamal] Okay.
I have a great activity we can do together.
Lockpicks. Probably from some master thief.
Or maybe just a retiring locksmith.
That cool?
I first learned to do this when I was about your age.
I was the first kid in school interested in door hardware.
[Uncle] Now, the trick… is to move both slowly.
Feel for the catch.
Before you know it…
Houdini who? Houdini me. That's Houdini who.
That's a little… mantra. You don't have to say that.
Wanna have a go?
I'm a little doorknobbed out.
That's fine. We can, um… [clicks tongue] We'll do something else. We'll, uh…
play soccer.
We could play soccer. Wanna… uh, build a pillow fort?
Are you reading a list off your phone?
-Yes. Yes, I am. -[phone locks]
I'm gonna just…
Oh, sure. Totally.
Pig?
Pig, what are you doing?
[Nemo] Oh my gosh, Pig.
You found it.
Come on, Pig. Let's go find Dad.
Boring book, boring book, boring…
See ya.
Um, I have to check my schedule. Can I see your phone?
Uh, yeah.
[Uncle] Look at you, using apps. See what happens when you try?
[Nemo] Yup, just learnin' new stuff all the time.
[Nemo] Oh, Flip.
Come on, Pig.
[echoing] Flip?
Flip?
-[Pig grunting] -[Nemo] Flip? -[metal clanging] -[Flip laughing]
-[Nemo] Flip! -[tool clatters]
[Flip] You.
I found the map.
I knew I liked you. [chuckles]
-You tried to kill me. -I was trying to wake you up.
-You tried to kill me. -I was trying to wake you up. Everybody knows you can't die in your dreams.
You told me about this in my dream, and then I find it in the Waking World.
How is that possible?
[clicks tongue] Maybe the real world's bigger than you thought.
[Nemo] Hey! It's my map. You can't just take it.
Yeah, well, I hate to break it to you, kid.
Taking people's stuff's kind of my thing.
-[Flip gasps] -You said I could see my dad again. I'm coming with you.
Listen, that's real sweet and all, and I miss your dad too, but you're not comin'! Go away.
but you're not comin'! Go away.
What was that?
Double-Knock.
He told you about the Double-Knock?
You have to take me. Outlaw Code.
Oh, don't tell me about the Outlaw Code.
I'm one of the cocreators of the Outlaw Code.
Before me, it was just one knock.
This isn't some Girl Scout trip to Lollipop Land, okay?
We're gonna have to travel through people's dreams to get to that treasure.
So you get killed, it's on you.
You said you can't die in a dream.
I said you can't die in your dream. You die in your dream, you wake up.
You die in someone else's dream, you don't wake up. Ever.
I don't care. I'm coming.
Fine.
You slow me down, you screw things up, this map is mine, and you're on your own.
-Deal. -Let me see your gear.
[under breath] Double-Knock.
What is this? Extraordinary Knobs.
It's my Uncle Philip's. He's a doorknob salesman.
He has no friends, no life, and he makes me go to school.
What a monster.
Well, this'll put you to sleep faster than any sleeping pill.
Okay, here. You hold on to this when you fall asleep.
That way, you can find me when we're on the road. Okay?
-[Pig burps] -What the heck is that?
[Nemo] He's a pig, and his name is Pig.
Super creative. Fine. Bring him. I love bacon.
All right. Look at this.
The World of Dreams.
This is a map of every dream in the world. Slumberland.
Your dad and I used this map to go on all our adventures back in the day,
jumpin' from dream to dream, to wherever we wanted to go.
We swiped this map from a dream cop at the Bureau.
She's been chasing me ever since.
The Bureau?
Bureau of Subconscious Activities, BOSA.
Unfortunately for us, they're the bozos that decide what you get to dream.
Unless you end up here.
-The Sea of Nightmares. -[thunder crashing]
Sea of Nightmares. My dad told me about that.
That's where the Pearls are.
[Flip] Greatest treasure in the world.
The sticky part is those dream cops at the Bureau
don't want us to know they even exist.
Because you get your hands on one of those bad boys,
and you can wish for whatever you want here in Slumberland.
And it's out of their control.
I could see my dad again?
If you don't die. Which you probably will.
Oh my God. Your dad would kill me if he knew I was doing this.
All right, listen, we're looking for reoccurring dreams.
That way, we can get out the same way that we got in.
Where's the door?
What door?
[sighs] The Bureau puts in secret doors to connect the dreams.
Civilians aren't supposed to know, unless you're a genius like myself.
[martial arts shout] Look out!
Okay, that was definitely not here before.
All right, we go through this door, everything changes.
You slip up, you're dead. You'll never see the Waking World again.
Okay. [takes a deep breath]
What are we waiting for?
That's the spirit.
All right. Welcome to my world, kid.
Brand-new dream, still under construction.
Elegante. Spanish for "I look good."
I'm a flippin' outlaw, so I don't play by the rules.
But here's the rules.
Rule number one, keep a low profile.
We don't wanna get caught messin' around in other people's dreams, trust me.
-If the dream pigs catch you, they will-- -[Pig grunts]
Oh. My bad, buddy.
If the dream cops catch you, they will lock you up and throw away the key.
Doomed to rot in a dingy Bureau prison cell
for all of eternity till you cease to exist entirely.
So blend in.
Yeah, 'cause you totally blend in.
Rule number two, stay focused.
[whistles] We're not here to have fun, okay?
We get in, we find the next door, then we get out.
Onto the next dream. Our one and only mission is finding those Pearls.
Rule number three. We're not friends. We're not partners.
I am the boss. El Jefe, 'kay? We do as I say, you got it?
So rule number three's just a bunch of aggressive statements?
Nobody likes a smart aleck, kid.
-[in Spanish] Excuse me. -[Flip] Hey, buddy. What's up?
Are you sure you're in the right dream? [Flip] Ooh.
I don't see you on my list. [Flip] Mmm.
The girl represents long-lost childhood.
I'm a troubling mix of a father figure
and raw, masculine power. [manager clears throat, clicks tongue] Uh…
And… what is this?
Brother…
[in English, with Spanish accent] …sometimes a pig is just a pig.
Silly puerco.
Yes.
[in Spanish] Library.
[clears throat] Perdón.
Do you party?
No, I don't.
You party. I party.
[mutters] Okay.
-Gracias. -Okay.
[in English] What was that?
I don't know Spanish. That's the only word I know.
Leave it to the pros. That's me. That's professional.
Ooh, it's all about the Miss D, misdirection. Did you know that? Boop!
I don't even know if this is real. Oh, that's real.
Now we're talkin'. [laughs]
Who wants the Waking World when you got all this, huh?
[Green] Oi! Agent Green. Bureau of Subconscious Activities. This the thieving punk you rang about?
Bureau of Subconscious Activities. This the thieving punk you rang about?
[Green] Cheers, mate.
Our next door
is behind the stage, yeah. [chuckles]
[band leader, in Spanish] And now, the Salsa Queen of Old Havana!
[in English] There's our dreamer.
-[laughs] Classic repression dream. -[Nemo] What's that?
Well, you never heard of Freud? [in singsong] Repression.
All those feelings get bottled up, and they go busting out in Slumberland.
I guarantee she's nothin' like that in the Waking World. Believe me.
[in Spanish accent] You see me? Yes.
[in Spanish] Mm! What is that scent?
[in English] It's au naturel. By Flip.
[sighs, in Spanish] Such raw, masculine power.
Gracias.
But at the same time… a deep sadness.
Like a lost little boy, far from home.
[sighs] Dance with me.
[in English] Hey! You said we weren't here to have fun.
I said you're not here to have fun. I'm an outlaw.
If I'm not havin' fun, I'm doin' my job wrong. -Know what I'm sayin'? -Hmm.
[in Spanish] Who's she?
Go away, Nemo. You'll ruin the nice lady's dream. -Buh-bye. -[Nemo grunts]
-[wings flapping loudly] -Flip!
-[music grows sinister] -[Nemo] What about the Pearls?
[Nemo, whimpering] Flip!
[panting] Flip? Please!
[Flip] What the Flip?
That's no bueno.
Adiós. Let's get to that door, fast.
Hello, Flip. Where's that map?
[snarls] Green.
I've been waiting for this for a long time.
The dream cop.
You're under a--
[shakily] What… the…?
"What the…?" [chuckles]
[Flip] Nightmare!
Look out!
[grunting and straining] Oh my God!
Ew, yucky!
-[music fades] -[Flip] Holy moly.
It took years for me to shake that cop off my tuchus.
First dream out with you, I get her and a nightmare?
You're like a bad luck charm.
And I don't get it. That nightmare flew right past the dreamer.
[sighs] Why the heck was it coming after us?
I've seen it before.
The night my dad died.
It's yours. It's your nightmare.
What?
You brought the nightmare. Nightmares smell fear.
It's tracking you, and nightmares won't stop until they get you.
[panting] Do you ruin every party you go to?
I've never even been to a party.
I never should've brought you. Give me the map back.
No. I did the Double-Knock.
Give it to me!
[Flip] What is that?
No, no, no. Don't-- Don't wake up! Don't wake up!
No, give me… give me the map!
-Hey. -Uh, what are you doing here?
Checking my mushrooms.
Mushroom club. It's a… one-person club.
Are you hiding out down here?
No.
'Cause I mean, you weren't in class, and this looks a little bit like a secret hideout, so…
and this looks a little bit like a secret hideout, so…
School thinks I'm on a trip, and my uncle thinks I'm at school.
Hardcore.
Uh, you won't tell anybody I'm here, though, right?
Omertà, the vow of silence.
You can try some of my mushrooms. Just brush 'em off first. It's manure.
Just brush 'em off first. It's manure. It's not my poop, so it isn't weird or anything.
Bye.
See ya. [sighs]
Hey… [sighs]
…squirt. [chuckles]
Can I take the… I wanna show you something really cool.
You ready?
And… surprise.
I arranged with Carla to get it here,
and I figured maybe this Saturday we could go sailing.
I mean, you could go sailing.
I'm strictly a dry-land guy due to my sensitive bowels.
You should sell it or something.
I don't think I wanna sail anymore.
[Philip] Nemo, I know this is hard.
And different and scary.
But I think it would be a mistake if you shut yourself off from the world,
like your dad did.
What are you talking about?
Your dad was… different before.
And then, when your mom died--
My dad wasn't shut off.
[scoffs] Nemo, he moved to an island.
Do you ever go anywhere or do anything?
Do you have any actual friends? Doorknobs don't count.
[scoffs] I'm just saying, don't be afraid to… I don't know, have fun again.
I'm not afraid of anything.
-I'm gonna go to bed. -[mouthing] What?
It's like 5:30.
I know you wanna sleep all the time because you're sad.
I know that feeling.
But life is what happens when you're awake.
Not mine!
[whining] Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep.
-Damn it. This is interesting! -[book thuds]
You okay?
I just wanna sleep.
Maybe if you tried putting on some pajamas.
This is what I wear to bed.
Okay, well, what did your dad do to help you get to sleep?
Sometimes… he'd tell me stories.
Aren't you a little old for that?
-Never mind. -[Philip] No, it's fine.
I can try to make up a story.
Okay. Sorry, I didn't realize you were gonna be watching me. That's… That's fine.
This is a story based on a true story
about a man…
on Christmas Eve…
I think.
Who took delivery of 30,000 porcelain doorknobs from a supplier in France,
but instead of being three inches in diameter,
these knobs were three centimeters. [chuckles]
Try fitting a metric doorknob onto a standard escutcheon.
-What to do? -[gentle music playing]
You would need a Christmas miracle.
But then our hero realized
that these little knobs were the perfect size
for standard cabinet drawer pulls.
You must be exhausted. That was the exciting part.
[kisses] Good night, Nemo.
Flip.
Well.
You came back.
[grunts] I'm impressed.
-I'm proud of you. -Really?
Nah. Go away. Go home.
I don't have a home. Without that Pearl, I don't have anything.
You don't get it, kid.
Nightmares smell fear. And you, you're scared.
I'm not scared.
I mean it. [growls]
Just take your feelings, crumple 'em up in a little ball, and shove 'em down deep.
'Cause I'm not doin' this for you. I'm doin' it for your dad.
Same.
Yeah? Yeah, double same.
-[Nemo] Pig! -[Pig oinks]
[Flip] No. No pigs. Get outta here.
-[Nemo] Come on, Pig. -[Pig snorting]
So, who are you in the Waking World? Or… what are you?
Don't remember, don't care. [sighs]
Haven't woken up for a long time.
Well, I mean, you kinda have to wake up.
Everybody wakes up.
Not me. After your dad quit the game before he had you,
I just kept goin', y'know?
Door after door, dream after dream.
Then I realized… [laughing] …I don't have to wake up.
You know, after a while, you sort of forget about the small details, like, uh,
y'know, who I am.
Anyhoo, when I get that Pearl, I'll have everything that I want.
What are you gonna wish for?
[Flip] No more Agent Green would be nice.
All I want is my dad.
If I could see him, I don't really care what happens in the Waking World.
-Yeah, I miss your dad too. -[Pig sighs]
So, he told you all about me, huh?
-Every night. -Yeah, man.
We were a heck of a team.
Goin' wherever we wanted, takin' whatever we wanted.
We were tippy-top of the Bureau's most wanted list.
[chuckles] Oh, man.
Now I think I'm down to 13, but… I'm bouncin' back.
I can feel it. [sniffs]
Anyways… [sighs, groans]
…I just can't get a bead on this next door. It keeps movin'.
Oh man.
The door is in the truck. Shh.
-[Flip] Cool. Cool. -[Nemo] Cool. Cool. Cool.
-[sighs] Yeah, right? -[Nemo] Mm-hmm.
You party?
-Yeah, you party. -[Nemo] Yeah, I party so hard.
-Clear. -[high-pitched] Aww!
-Yeah! -[Pig screams]
Shred the gnar!
Who dreams of driving a garbage truck?
Don't judge. At least it's original.
It's not like, "Oh my God, I didn't study for the test. Where's my pants?"
Or, uh, "Hey, I'm ridin' a giant goose, eh?"
I've never heard of the giant goose one before.
Most popular dream in Canada, kid. Look it up.
Green. [snarls]
-[gasps] Flip! -[bells ringing]
-[Flip groans] -[Nemo] Flip! -[groans] Oh! [grunts] -[lever clicks]
Flip, help! Flip, help!
Green.
[echoing] Look!
Look at how strong I am.
[Flip] Hurry, the door's in the cab.
You gotta be kidding me.
She does not give up.
Yeah, she wants her map back.
Oh, no.
This is awesome.
What kind of maniac is drivin' this thing?
-Go! Go! Go! Go! -[Nemo screams]
-[music swells, fades] -Oh, hello.
I'm driving my truck.
That explains the poor cornering skills.
Killer tats. Drive your truck faster, sir.
Oh, boy!
Where's the door? Uh…
Oh, here it is. Here, hold on to that. Hold on. [grunting]
It's locked. Of course it is. -Awesome. -[Green's engine revving]
[Flip] That's not ideal.
[Flip] Oh, great.
Again, not ideal.
Keep it together, kid.
-[panting] I can do this. -Oh, man.
You're a nightmare magnet.
Yeah!
Yeah! Ah!
Yeah.
That's what I call a getaway.
I thought you were gonna lose an arm. -I thought it was gonna get gross. -What are you doing?
-I thought it was gonna get gross. -What are you doing?
Normally I drip-dry,
but I learned this little ditty from a real gangster's dream.
Pretty rebellious, you know? Now put your hands up, ready? Here.
♪ Don't touch my horns 'Cause they hold up my halo ♪
Come here.
Shoot 'em off.
♪ 'Cause we're outlaws Get off me, get off me! ♪
-[Nemo giggles] -[sighs] I'm proud of you.
We're gonna make an outlaw outta you yet.
-[gun beeps] -Run!
You made me work for it, I'll give you that.
Finally, I can retire, get some sun.
Thirty years.
Thirty years chasing your sorry butt for mucking up people's dreams.
I'm 160. I should have retired ages ago, but no.
I couldn't clear your flippin' name off my board.
Well, I got you now.
All-inclusive. One of the top-rated dreams in Slumberland.
I'll be sure to send you a postcard. In jail, of course.
Not like there's any glory in it. Whoop-de-do!
Not like there's any glory in it. Whoop-de-do! I caught Slumberland's 28th most wanted.
-[watch beeps] -[Flip groans] Twenty-eight? Try 13.
You're slippin', mate.
-Right. You're under arrest. -[high-pitched] Aww!
You got nothin'.
You brought a squid to a salsa party. Do you think that's funny?
[Flip chuckles] Put it that way, it's kinda funny. Right?
Oh, okay.
With popcorn, they're delicious.
[whispering] Pick those up.
You just put those in there. I know I didn't do that.
I stole that fair and square.
-[Green] Where's my map? -[Flip scoffs] Your map?
-[Green] Where's my map? -[Flip scoffs] Your map? It's ancient history. I have no idea where that map is.
And who's this? Your bodyguard?
Who, her? Yeah, I dragged her along. Got nothing to do with it. It was all me.
You've done a lot of crime, Flip. -You're gonna do a lot of time. -[faucets squeak]
[Green] As in forever.
[Green] All right, let's get you locked up and find that map, why don't we?
I'm actually gonna miss hunting you down. Oi! [whistles] Here.
If it makes you feel any better, you could just let me go.
Nah, it's gonna make me feel really good to lock you up.
[chuckles] You make that sound kinda fun. -[doors and ceiling whirring] -Whee! [sniffs]
That was inappropriate. I'm… I'm sorry.
-[elevator dings] -You think you're this big man.
-But you're just a pathetic little-- -Hey, Cindy.
Oh! Hey, Frank.
Cindy? 160-year-old Cindy.
[mockingly] Sassy Cindy.
-[grunts, softly] Sorry, Cindy. [sniffles] -[display panel beeping]
So, uh, still over in Oedipal dreams?
Uh, no. They moved me to 6200.
Oh. That's exhausting.
Hey, at least I get my steps in, right?
Waffle?
You're just a pathetic little man-boy.
-Thank you. -[Green] Mm.
We run a finely tuned machine here.
We can't have losers like you botching up the works.
And I've met punks like you before.
"Slumberland, just one nonstop party!" "I'm never gonna leave!"
And then one day, you realize… you're all alone.
You've got no friends, no family.
No one gives a damn about you, all because you didn't want to wake up.
What do you think I'm tryin' to do?
[Green] Well, now you'll just be a vague memory.
-Flip, you had a good run. Mm. -[elevator bell dings]
But now, you're done.
No! No! No! No!
Please! Stop! Stop! No!
[Flip] Forget it, kid. We're in here for good.
[Nemo] What do we do now?
[sighs] There's nothing we can do.
I thought you didn't wanna wake up.
I can't.
When you stay in Slumberland too long, you forget everything.
I just thought if I got that Pearl, I could remember who I am.
I just wanna wake up.
She's right.
Nobody gives a damn about me.
I do.
Bodyguard, come with me.
What about him?
[Green] Oh, he's checked in for good.
But he can't help it.
-He doesn't remember who he is. -Chop-chop. Well, now he can remember.
He's got loads of time.
-Sorry it didn't work out, kid. -[cell door squeaks, clangs]
Not many people get to peek behind the curtain.
-Want to see where the magic happens? -[phones ringing]
Welcome to the Bureau of Subconscious Activities.
Clearly, management hasn't updated our wardrobe
or the facilities since the early '70s,
'cause the Bureau blows its budgets on the dreams, and we get the leftovers.
So, two ways this can go.
You can end up like Flip, alone, in a cell forever.
Or I can cut you loose,
but I'm only going to do that if you've learnt your lesson.
Otherwise, you can go straight to rot in a cell in juvie. [exhales]
So, looks like you're going through some stuff.
We gave you the lighthouse dream.
That's your safe place. The nightmares can't get you there.
But my dad's not there.
I wanna see my dad.
Yeah, we don't give you what you want. We give you what you need.
Everything in Slumberland happens for a reason.
You're messing with a finely tuned machine here, love.
Then give me a dream with my dad.
-And I'll never leave. -Yeah. No dream lasts forever. All right?
Sooner or later, they all fade.
You're gonna visit the lighthouse for a little while,
and then it's gonna be gone, then you'll have other dreams.
You'll move on.
I don't wanna move on.
[sighs] If you don't move on, the nightmares will find you, and they will destroy you.
Then how do I make them go away?
By being brave.
And when you're brave enough, then they can't hurt you.
I'm not afraid of anything.
Being brave isn't about not being scared.
It's about doing what you have to do, even when you are.
And I know you're not afraid of car chases or jumping off cliffs.
I'm talking about what you're really scared of. Being alone.
Someday, you're gonna find something new.
Something so important
that you're going to stop trying to hold on to what's already gone.
And when that happens, that big scary squid that's been chasing you around?
It'll vanish into thin air.
No more nightmares.
Until puberty.
Yeah, that whole thing's a frickin' nightmare.
You think some magic Pearl's gonna solve all your problems?
Let me let you in on a little secret.
[whispering] There are no Pearls. It's a myth.
Stay where you belong.
Nemo, you have the dream you're meant to have.
We make sure of that.
Time to wake up.
Hey. Can't sleep?
Me neither.
You know, things get darkest right before the dawn.
The world's stupid that way. [chuckles]
[crying] I'm never gonna see him again.
I wanna show you something.
Sit down.
I haven't looked through this stuff in years.
Where is…? Ah.
[softly] Come on.
That's your dad.
That's my dad?
[Philip] I worshipped him back then.
Your dad and I, all we really had was each other.
He told me stories too… every night.
Wild adventures we were gonna go on.
Long-lost treasure we were gonna find.
We lived in a fantasy world.
Probably 'cause it was better than the real world.
Red string?
Right, that was our special trick
for finding each other in our dreams. [chuckles]
Your dad and I were convinced we'd figured out how to meet up in our dreams and go on those adventures.
how to meet up in our dreams and go on those adventures.
Flip?
How'd you know about that?
You're dressed like Flip. I don't understand.
Flip was my outlaw name.
I was pretty shy. When I was with other kids, I barely spoke.
But when I was with your dad in our dreams,
I could be whoever I wanted to be.
And for me, that was Flip.
And then your dad met your mom, and she was so great.
Looked just like you.
And um… they decided to have a real adventure.
I begged him not to go.
But off they went, sailed around the world.
And then I was alone, and I shut down, even worse than before.
You said you don't remember your dreams.
-That's when it started, right? -[clicks tongue] Yeah, I guess.
I was pretty broken up about it. I didn't sleep for three nights.
And after that, no more Flip.
I was just Philip.
Your dad would call from time to time to check in,
and he'd tell me about all his crazy adventures.
And he'd ask me what I was doin', and…
I'd have to tell him all about my boring life.
[shakily] So after a while, I just…
let him go to voice mail.
Anyway… ancient history now.
I moved on. I'm sure he did too.
I have to go back.
I mean, I have to get ready for school.
Uh, ready? What? It's like 5:00 a.m.
I've got a lot to do.
Can I borrow your lockpicks… for school?
Go ahead. Take 'em.
My dad didn't move on.
He told stories about you every night.
Nemo. Hey.
I gotta go.
I heard Davenport and Arya talking about her.
You know why she moved here, right? Her dad died.
-[wings fluttering] -Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry.
-[truck door slams] -[Nemo panting] Hey, kid.
-I'm driving my truck. -[Pig oinks]
-I know. -[hatch squeaks]
You, out.
-Long-lost childhood. -[Pig snorts]
[in adult's voice] Babies.
Obviously.
-[elevator rattles, bell dings] -Oh, well. [chuckles]
Time to make the doughnuts.
-[baby] Have a nice day. -[Pig snorts]
[quietly] You came back for me.
You gotta come for your partner, even if he's a pain in the--
You gotta come for your partner, even if he's a pain in the-- -Applesauce! -Tie this while I get you outta here.
-Applesauce! -Tie this while I get you outta here.
Oh, I know. [laughs]
Pickin' locks?
-I knew you were an outlaw. -[lock clangs]
Houdini who? Houdini me. That's Houdini who. [giggles]
-Whoa, check this out. -What do we got here?
-[Red] Hey. -[Pig oinks]
[in Brooklyn accent] Say, uh, I'm from juvie, and this guy was stealin' from us.
[scoffs] Toys, candies, puppy dogs.
Yeah, you got nothin' on me, kid. [growls]
-You like wreckin' kids' dreams, scumbag? -[Flip whimpering]
You like tearin' the heads off of teddy bears, huh? Huh? Huh?
-[Flip groans] -How 'bout I tear your head off?
[crying] Guys, take me away. She's so mean.
Juvie, man. They do not mess around.
Yo, I gotta bail.
-Right. -Okay, see you after lunch.
[Flip] Is this really necessary?
-[Flip] Well, that's awkward. -[sighs] You must be having a laugh, mate.
Let's see how tough you are without that thingamabobber.
Okay. Want some of this, do ya?
-Yeah? Ready for it? -[Flip] Yeah!
Oh, man. [whines, panting]
You're so tough for a 160-year-old lady.
You're under a--
It's all about misdirection.
You're gonna make me really regret being so nice to you. [gasps]
Yes. Excuse me, Cindy.
-[Nemo] Excuse me. Excuse me. -Pardon me. Uh…
How's this gonna work? Oh, boy.
-There ya go. Ah, okay. -[Nemo] Ow.
Here we go.
-And you. -[elevator bell dings]
-Hey, here. -[Nemo] Oh.
-Get a "momento." -[Nemo] Ah.
-Yeah, right. -[Nemo] Say cheese.
Fromage!
-Perfect. -[Flip gasps]
-[elevator bell dings] -Sorry. Sorry.
-[Flip] Sorry, not sorry. -[Nemo laughs]
All right. Okay, hey, look.
Yeah.
This elevator's gonna take us right where we wanna go.
The last stop before the Sea of Nightmares.
[laughing] We're gonna get our Pearls.
Yeah, about that. I have to tell you something.
Okay, well, just wait a second.
[snickers] Classic, right?
[chuckles] Yeah. There are no Pearls.
[sighs, chuckling slightly] What're you talking about?
It's a myth. Agent Green told me.
And you believed her? [scoffs]
She was just tryin' to keep you in your place.
It ain't no myth, believe me.
-How do you know? -'Cause your dad saw them.
We were there. Sea of Nightmares?
Yeah, he went all the way down the whirlpool. All the way to the bottom.
And then he saw the Pearls, thousands of 'em.
Your dad had the greatest imagination… but he would never lie.
We can't go back.
We're not goin' back. [chuckles]
[Flip] C'mon, kid.
-[both panting] -Ooh, it's bright.
-[Pig squealing] -Much better.
Okay, here we go.
Pig!
Come on, kid!
The final door's gotta be out here somewhere.
Keep goin'! Go! Go!
-[both panting] -[Flip] Hey.
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey. Whoa.
[Nemo] So, what do we do now?
[in Canadian accent] Whoa! Oh, hey there! How about this view, eh?
-Canada? -Like I said, number-one dream.
Go away! [grunts]
Eat this, Green!
-Come on, Flip! -What're you doin'?
-[Nemo] The geese! -[Flip] Oh, but you're crazy!
[Canadian] Whoa, hey!
[laughs] You think that's a thing of beaut?
Well, let me tell ya, there's a Timmies.
That's a Tim Horton's for ya. Pert near 20 clicks that way--
-Hey, buddy. -[Canadian] Oh, yeah, eh?
I wanna swipe your gooser here, eh?
Uh, yeah. Sure, bud. Scooch my goose.
[laughing] Keep your stick on the ice!
-Ooh. Right down there. -[goose honks]
Oh, man.
-Hey, Bob? -[giant goose honks] -[Flip] That was awesome. -[loud honk]
-[Flip imitates honk, sighs] -Bye, Bob.
I think you and I should be partners. What do you think?
Look, there's something I need to tell you.
There it is! I found it before you!
-[laughing] -[Nemo] Race ya! Last one there is a rotten dream!
-[energetic orchestral music playing] -Wait, wait, wait. -Be cool. Be cool. Be cool. -[Pig snorts]
[quietly] It's the final door.
And it's open.
-Which is a first. -[whispering] Why are you being quiet?
-[Flip] 'Cause it's scary. -[Nemo] And dark.
-[Flip] Yeah, and dark. -[Nemo] And creepy.
[Flip] Yeah.
-[music swells] -[shouts] Hey!
I was just makin' sure no one's in there.
Well, you know, it's the gateway to the Sea of Nightmares, so… [chuckles]
Pearls are in here somewhere. All right.
Okay.
Ready?
-[Nemo takes a deep breath] -Here we go, partner.
-I don't wanna go first. -It's okay.
-But I'm scared. -[Flip] It's an initiation, so…
-[Nemo] Okay. -[Flip] All right.
It's cold.
[Flip] That's a whole lot of water.
Okay. [clears throat]
Gonna go for a little swim. No big deal.
I know who you are.
I found out in the Waking World.
Why the hell didn't you tell me?
Wait. Do I still have my hair?
Yeah. Just not as much.
Let me guess.
I'm a famous outlaw, yeah?
Men fear me? Ladies love me?
You're a doorknob salesman.
What'd you call me?
You're my dad's brother, Philip.
You and my dad came to Slumberland every night when you were kids.
And then, he left.
Oh, wow.
After that, Philip stopped dreaming, and you couldn't wake up.
I remember.
But when you get your Pearl,
you can wake up, and you can be one person again.
This is a buzzkill.
I'm gonna get us both killed for that guy?
We're so close, and he needs you.
Well, I don't need him, all right? I got everything that I want right here.
Wine, women, waffles. The three dubs.
Not necessarily in that order.
I'm not a knob seller. I'm a flippin' outlaw!
But I thought that when we get our Pearls,
I could be with my dad at night, and during the day, I could be with you.
You could be like my part-time dad.
I am nobody's dad, kid.
So you're just giving up?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go find a dream with a bar in it,
and then I'm gonna drink until I forget who I am again.
Then I'm gonna go find someone's ex. 'Cause there's a lot of them around here.
But I… I did the Double-Knock.
So did I, kid.
The night your dad left, I begged him to stay.
I'll go without you.
I'll see my dad again, and I don't care if I never wake up.
Hey, no. You can't.
It's too dangerous to go in alone.
You can't tell me what to do… 'cause you're not my dad.
I never shoulda brought you.
Just go back to where you belong. Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me.
Nemo.
[in a woman's voice] Nemo. Wake up.
Wake up!
-[Nemo gasps, shudders] -[Arya] Nemo?
Get your things.
We're calling your uncle.
[Arya] It's not just the lying, Nemo. It's sneaking off like that. No one knew where you were.
It's sneaking off like that. No one knew where you were.
For all we knew, you could've been in terrible danger.
Yeah.
Why would you do that?
You wouldn't understand.
Why don't you try me?
Okay.
Well, m-- Maybe it would help if, uh… if you went first.
Philip?
Would you like to tell Nemo how you're feeling?
I don't know what you want me to say. I don't do feelings.
Everyone does feelings, whether you like it or not.
You two are in the same boat. You just don't realize it.
Guys, come on. You're both struggling with powerful emotions,
and you just… you just need to deal with them.
Do we, though?
Um, everybody always says that, but… I'm not convinced.
I-- I-- I've [scoffs] I've never dealt with my feelings, and I'm fine.
I was fine.
Should've just had them send me to foster care.
You'd probably be better off.
At least foster parents know how to be parents.
Nemo, we should probably talk.
I don't wanna talk. You wanna get rid of me, so get rid of me.
[sighs] I'm not trying to get rid of you, Nemo. I'm… I'm trying to help you.
You're as bad as he is.
What? Who?
You only care about yourself.
Are you kidding? I have done nothing but take care of you.
I-- I-- I cook. I-- I entertain.
I try.
And what do I get in return? You just lie to my face.
I think we're bonding, and I let you borrow my precious lockpicks so--
Nobody cares about door stuff, okay? Why do you think you have no friends?
Why do you think you live alone?
You should go to your room!
Where do you think I'm going? You're not my dad!
Hey, I'm not trying to be!
I live alone because I like it that way!
I didn't ask for any of this to happen. I didn't ask you to come live here!
But I'm glad you did.
Pig, we're goin' home.
[Philip] Nemo?
No, I don't know. I don't--
Carla, I don't know. I just woke up, and she wasn't here.
Well, I have no idea where she would go.
Right.
Pig!
-Oh, yeah. [laughs] -[air-raid sirens wailing]
[Flip] Oh! The End of the Line!
-It's party time! -[neon sign buzzing]
Yeah, baby! Oh!
Number one! Top of Slumberland, baby!
You see that?
Hope they catch the bastard.
[Flip] Oh, yeah. Guy seems like a real bad egg. You know? Pee-yew.
He took a little girl to the Sea of Nightmares,
and then he ditched her, and she went in alone.
-What? -Yeah.
Hey, you're…
A shiny pink diamond?
-Yeah. Pretty, isn't it? Hi-yah! -That's nice.
[Nemo, echoing] Come on, Pig. Grab one, and let's go.
[exclaims] Yeah!
Flip?
[Nemo] Flip!
[Flip] I got ya. Oh!
Get in the cab!
You came back for me!
Yeah. Outlaw Code. Never leave your partner behind.
-Even if she is a pain in the… -Applesauce.
Applesauce! [laughs]
Oh! I got a Pearl.
Oh! Aces!
So long, suckers!
Oh, hey! Hey, guys!
-[Pig squeals] -[screaming] Nightmare!
[laughing] Whoo!
We have to get to the lighthouse! Green said it's my safe place!
I know!
Don't look down!
-Pull up! -I am!
-[Nemo screaming] -Oh my! Oh my!
-[grunting] -[Nemo whimpers] No! Drive the plane!
-Flip, come on. Flip! -[Pig oinks]
[Canadian] Aw, jeez. What a gong show.
Okay, one minute, you think you're going out for a rip…
Oh. Hey, sorry, guy.
And the next thing you know, you're goin' for a dip.
There he is.
-[Canadian whimpering] -Get in here!
Come on. Hey, Emmett, you party?
I party.
Come here! Get in here!
[in Southern accent] Hey, Emmett, take a right.
Here we go.
-I can't. I can't. What's that? -Come here, buddy.
Hit it, Emmett!
[Flip] Yeah!
Help! Oh, my hair! My hair!
[in Spanish] I knew you'd return!
I smelled your musk.
Uh, sí, sí, sí. Pero no.
Pero no.
-[Canadian gasps] -[announcer on TV] Now, McRoy to center. There's O'Reilly… Great pass to Johnson, and a goal!
-He scores! -Yes! Let's go! Let's go!
-[motor whirring] -[wind whipping] -[wistful piano music playing] -[thunder rumbling]
[sighs] We're gonna make it, kid.
Come on. I see the lighthouse.
Come on, kid. We're almost there. You can finally make your wish.
[gasps] What's wrong?
[weakly] Oh… I don't feel so good.
[Flip] Nemo!
[Carla] Hey, slow down! Slow down!
Pig.
[Flip] What's wrong?
[weakly] Something's not right.
I'm gonna get you home.
You'll be safe at home.
There!
There!
Wait, the Pearl.
I dropped the Pearl. We have to go back.
You get to the lighthouse. I'll get the Pearl, okay? Go.
Wait. No, not without you!
-[Flip grunting] -[Nemo] Flip! -Yes! -[Flip groans]
Flip!
-[Flip yelling and grunting] -[Nemo] Flip!
[Flip groaning] Nemo!
[Flip, echoing] Nemo, go! Get to the lighthouse!
Say hi to your dad for me.
Flip? Wake up.
[Carla] Philip!
What are you doing?
[Carla] No! Get down! Philip! Philip!
[Carla] No!
Let's go home.
Well, this is gonna be a buttload of paperwork.
So Nemo, how do you feel? Different?
Big journey, all by yourself.
I see you've found yourself a Pearl.
Guess it's not a myth after all.
I didn't get my dad back.
You had to give up your dream.
I guess you found something more important.
Right, better get to work, then.
-[Pig snorting] -[Green] Oh, uh… [sighs]
You've got a good pig there.
Give it a squeeze for me.
-[Pig grunts] -[Green] Told you.
You have the dream you're meant to have.
We make sure of that.
What you do next…?
Well, that's up to you.
Ugh! Seriously? Look at this mess!
Can I get a cleaning crew in here pronto? Come on!
[crying] I missed you so much.
I miss you.
Race you to the top?
Help!
-Nemo! She's not breathing. -[Carla] Okay.
We got her! We got her. It's okay. Okay.
Did you ever figure it out? What the lighthouse is for?
-[Pig oinking] -It's not to keep ships safe.
No. If we wanted to do that, we'd never let 'em leave harbor, would we?
[Carla] Nothing. Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six.
-Come on, Nemo! -[Carla] Seven, eight, nine.
-[Philip] Breathe! -[Carla] Come on. Oh.
To guide you on your journey.
That's right.
So you can see things that the lighthouse keeper can only dream of.
I didn't teach you all those things so you could live on an island.
I did it so that you could know…
you can do anything.
[Carla] Okay, come on, Nemo.
One, two, three…
I didn't think I could go on without you.
You traveled to the Sea of Nightmares and came back home safe again.
After that, I don't think the Waking World's gonna be too difficult.
But that's up to you.
Life is waiting for you, Nemo.
It would be a shame to miss that.
[crying] I have to go back.
That's my girl.
[takes a deep breath] And you never forget…
how very proud I am of you.
And keep an eye on that brother of mine.
He seems normal, but he's not.
Deep down, he's a wild man.
Bye, Dad.
[Carla] Okay, let's go!
Come on, get her over!
There we go! Good girl, Nemo! -[laughing] Good girl! -[Philip sobbing]
[Carla] Good girl.
You're okay. You're okay.
I got you. And I'm not gonna let go of you ever, okay?
Flip?
[softly] Yeah. [mimics Flip] It's Flip.
And Philip. Philip and Flip.
Flilip? [high-pitched snicker]
-[Undeadheads groan] -[Nemo] Bye, Jamal. See you tomorrow. [Jamal] See ya.
You know, not a lot of people know this, but I'm actually a master pickpocket.
Oh, come on. No, you're not. [chuckles]
-Oh my G-- -You have very smooth wrists.
[Arya] Wait. What? How did you…?
I'm gonna take you sailing.
Maybe next time you can come with us.
Yeah, I'd love to. [chuckles]
Aces.
Oh. Oh, wait. I need my watch back.
[Philip and Arya laugh] Yeah.
No. No, seriously. Can I get my watch back?
[quietly] Call me.
Oh, great. You're already dressed for bed.
[Nemo] Well, I don't like to be late.
So, what's the plan tonight?
I don't know. I think I might just wander and see what happens.
Sounds good.
-Night-night, kiddo. I love you. -I love you too.
You sitting comfortably? All settled in? Okay, good.
Now, listen.
I'm gonna tell you a story.
It's all about the time we escaped from a chicken farm.
[Rocky] There was this farmer, see?
-And she absolutely hated chickens. -[hens gasp]
[Rocky] Kept them locked up like prisoners.
I guess you could say she had a real axe to grind.
Got herself a machine that turned chickens into pies.
We mustn't panic!
[Rocky] But what she didn't plan on was going toe to toe
with a certain freedom-fighting chick.
She was fierce, fearless, and wanted one thing and one thing only.
-Freedom. -[hens gasp]
[Rocky] She pulled us all together…
…and gave us the wings to fly right outta that hen-hole.
-She got every chicken out of there. -[chickens cheer]
[Rocky] And got rid of that wicked farmer to boot.
-Bye-bye. -[scream echoes]
[Rocky] And you know who that freedom-fighting chicken was?
-Your very own mom. -[music ends]
Rocky, don't you think bedtime stories might be a bit premature?
Well… I mean, you're never too young to learn where you came from.
But those days are over, thank goodness.
We've got our happy ending.
We're living in it.
Your way, Mac.
More fruit coming, Bunty.
Oh! Oh, thanks, Mac, 'cause I'm working up a thirst here.
-[panting and grunting] -[Fowler] Good work, Bunty. Keep it up.
[Ginger] You know what?
I think it's time to put the past behind us.
-[Babs] Turned out nice again. -Ooh, yeah. Lovely.
[Rocky] Past?
What past?
That past, behind us.
[Rocky] But these, these are our glory days.
That's who we are.
It's who we were.
We went through all that so our baby doesn't have to.
[sighs] Y'know, you are right.
From now on, our only mission is to keep our baby safe.
Don't you worry. Ol' Rocky here is on the case.
-[whimsical music playing] -[screams] What do I do? What do I do?
-[chick] Whoo-hoo! -It's hopping!
-Just grab it! -[grunts] -[chick] Whee! -[Ginger gasps]
-[chick grunts, exclaims] -Oh no!
Egg's up!
Good grief. A live shell.
-Clear the area! -[chick grunts]
-[chick strains] Whoo-hoo! [giggles] -[Rocky] Oh! Get it! -[Ginger] Watch out! -[chick] Huh?
-[Ginger gasps] -[Rocky] No!
Would you look at that. -[yawns, smacks lips] -[Ginger gasps]
[Rocky] We've got ourselves a family. Huh?
[softly] Oh, look at her, Rocky.
-[gasps] She's perfect. -[chick cheeps]
Welcome to the world.
-[Ginger] Molly. -[Molly] Mm.
Ah, what a bonny wee hen.
Oh, she's got her father's spindly little legs.
We need to build them up, what, what.
When I was in the RAF, we did 50 squats before breakfast. -[grunts, groans] -[Bunty] Ah. Oh.
[Fowler] That's gone.
-I made her a bicycle. -Really?
[Ginger] Oh. You knitted one.
What a lovely… thought.
Thank you, Babs.
Y'know, I'd say our little island paradise just got a little more
"paradisier."
-Cock-a-doodle-doo! -[epic orchestral music playing]
[gasps] Molly! No, no, no, no! Stop that pram!
-That's my brave little girl. -Yes! You're doing great!
-Ooh. No, no, no, no. -No, no, no!
Molly, that's a bit too brave.
[Rocky] Careful up there, sweetheart. Hold on to the sides.
-Hold on to it. -[Molly] Ah.
-Whee! -Oh no! No, no, no!
-Outrageous! -♪ Cherry pie, buttercup ♪
-Anyone for tea? -Ooh, yeah. Cuppa tea.
-Hey, boys. Welcome back. -[Molly gasps]
We have got some quality old junk for you today, Rocky, mate.
-Here you go. -Molly, hold on to this for Daddy.
-All right. Well, nice to see ya. -See you next month.
-Hiya, hen. -Huh?
Mm, bye-bye.
-[babbles vigorously] -[Ginger gasps] -[quietly] Mutt. -Ah.
-No, you cheater! Cheater! -[Rocky laughs]
-[both laugh] -See you later.
-[Molly] Hello! -Morning.
-Hello! Morning! -[hen 1] Morning!
-[Molly] Hiya! -[hen 2] Morning, pet!
[grunts] Hi, Mum.
-Oh. Hello, darling. -Hi, Dad!
Uncle Nick! Uncle Fetcher!
She just called me "uncle."
Steady, mate. Steady.
[voice breaking] But I've never had a family of me own.
Me neither. -[both crying hysterically] -[Rocky sighs]
Mum, I was thinking. Can we go over there?
Where, love?
The other side of the water.
Oh, we've spoken about this, Molly.
-There's nothing over there for us. -[bright music playing]
What about stuff Uncle Nick and Fetch bring?
Isn't that for us?
Hey. What's up, Ginge?
Rocky. [takes a deep breath]
Molly's asking about going off the island.
Oh, right.
Oh, right.
[inhales] Hey, Molly. Do you wanna see the world's coolest invention?
Okay.
-[cap sizzling] -What is it, Dad?
Only the answer to all of life's problems.
Popcorn. [sighs]
-Is that the best thing ever or what? -[tender orchestral music playing]
-Mm! It is good. -[scoffs] "Good"?
This is great! -[Rocky chuckles] -[Ginger sighs happily]
Life, my girl, doesn't get better than this.
-[Molly] Mum, what is it? -It's nothing to worry about, Molly.
Nothing at all.
Well, it was only a matter of time before the humans showed up.
[Ginger] It looks like they're taking them to some kind of chicken farm.
I haven't seen that look in a long while.
You can't right all the world's wrongs, duck.
Meeting tonight. Spread the word.
[tuts] Here we go again.
-[footsteps approach] -[Molly] What's going on, Mum?
Why can't I go up my tree anymore? What's this meeting about?
It's nothing, Molly.
It's, um, just…
There's some quite big wasps up there this year.
[sighs] Really?
Besides, I need someone to stay here and look after your dad.
Don't worry. I'm good.
[giggles] Okay.
Maybe while you're out, he can tell me a story.
Good idea.
Good night, my big, brave girl.
-[Molly giggles] -[Rocky] Good night, Ginge. Good luck.
Okay, Mollypod. What do you wanna do?
Well, I thought you could tell me about… this.
Uh, uh, uh, that… that is… not me.
Okay. Yes, it's me. But it was a long time ago.
And?
And,
actually,
it's a… it's a pretty good story.
[hen 1] It's not just eggs they want from us.
[Bunty] Ginger has that look about her.
I reckon she'll have us charging right into the fray.
I don't want to charge into any frays.
I… I'm fray-phobic.
-All right, everyone! Please, quiet! -[hen 2] Wait. She's starting.
-[Ginger] Quiet! -[hen 2] Shut your beak.
-[chatter dies down] -Now, we all know about the new road.
And the trucks taking chickens to what looks like some kind of farm.
A farm? [clucks nervously]
No, it's all right, Beryl. Listen. Listen.
We know from experience what that can mean.
It's something we just can't ignore.
We really only have one choice.
[shudders] I don't want to hear it.
We've got to do something.
We have to hide.
Hide?
Yes. Hide!
-[wing pops free] -You mean, pretend we're not here?
Exactly.
Operation Lie Low. Jolly good.
Ooh! I like lilos. Especially the stripy ones.
She's right, you know.
-It's really not our problem. -[hen 4 laughs] Oh, you!
Are you all right, hen?
It's not like you to shy away from danger.
I know, but I have Molly to think about now.
And I…
We can't risk our freedom by venturing into a world that finds chickens so…
by venturing into a world that finds chickens so…
delicious.
Lift!
[Ginger] Right.
All we have to do now is keep quiet and not draw attention to ourselves.
-[loudly] Cock-a-doodle-doo! -[group gasps]
[Ginger, hushed] Rocky!
Um, given our new situation, maybe you shouldn't crow anymore.
[gasps] Don't crow?
[chuckles] What? But that's, like, my thing.
Maybe you could do a different thing.
A quieter one?
[Molly] Wow! Look at this!
Molly! Get away from that.
-Ginge, can we talk about the whole… -[Fowler] She's right, you know.
-[yelps] -Careless squawks cost lives.
We have to lie low.
I'm running a camouflage lesson at noon.
If you can find me.
[Molly] What's it for, Mum?
[gasps] Oh! What is that?
It's got a chicken sitting in a bucket on it.
It's doing this.
[giggles] Oh, that's so funny.
Uh, let's go home.
Where are they going? [gasps] Can we go with them?
-It looks like a lot of fun. -I'm sorry, Molly.
-You're not ready to go off the island. -But I…
Uh, Rocky? Little help?
Maybe I could crow on weekends. Y'know?
Why am I not ready?
I'm a big, brave girl. -You always say so. -I know.
-You always say so. -I know. But you're still a child.
Says who?
Says me and your dad.
Right, Rocky?
Yeah, that's right. That's right. Yes. Listen to your mom, kiddo.
Oh! Oh. How about just half a crow? Like a "cock-a" or "doodle-doo"?
Something that's a little shorter.
Well, I'm going over to see those trucks because I am a Lone Free Ranger.
Like Dad was.
I've seen his poster.
He used to live over there, and you did too.
Did I say that? I don't… I don't remember.
That's it.
Molly, you are not leaving this island.
You can't make me stay here. You're not the boss of me.
Actually, I am.
Look, Molly, you've got everything you want right here.
Except for one thing.
And what's that?
Freedom.
-[Ginger sighs] -You know, she is a lot like you.
[Mrs. Tweedy, distorted] Your daughter is going to be delicious!
-[Ginger screams] -[yelps] Not the face! Not the face! -[groans, grunts] -[gasps]
-Huh? -[gasps] Molly?
-[ominous music playing] -[hens calling] Molly?
-[hen 1] Come out, Molly! -[hen 2] Molly!
-[hen 3] Molly? -[Babs] Molly?
-[Bunty] Molly! -[Fetcher] Molly!
-[Ginger] Molly? -Molly!
-[Ginger gasps] -[Fowler] Come out, Molly.
[Ginger] No!
-She's left the island. -[crowd clamoring]
[Molly] This isn't so bad.
Don't know what Mum was worried about. [chuckles nervously] I'm big and I'm brave.
[chuckles nervously] I'm big and I'm brave.
Yeah, course I am.
-And… -[low growl]
[gasps] …not very brave.
What were you doin'? Have you got a death wish?
No.
Wait, what's a death wish?
Isn't it a bit late for you to be out, baby girl?
I'm not a baby girl.
I'm a… I'm a big, brave girl.
And isn't it a bit late for you to be out too?
[chuckles] Okay, I like it.
Give as good as you get, eh?
Well, I'm Frizzle.
And you are?
Molly.
[sighs] Although, it's kind of a goofy name. So I'm thinking of changing it to…
Zip it, kidda.
-It's stoppin'. Now's our chance. -[brakes screech]
-Are you comin' or not? -Coming where?
To the happy chicken truck.
[gasps] You've seen them too?
Right.
Wherever that truck's goin',
it's gonna be cooler than a penguin's toenails.
Uh, what's a toenail?
What's a penguin?
Oh! You have got so much to learn. Come on.
[sighs] Wait for me!
I mean, so she found my poster, and I told her a story.
I don't think that's such a big deal.
Oh no. It was perfectly sensible to encourage our daughter
to be a Lone Free Ranger.
You know, if you had it your way, she'd still be in her shell.
Well, better in her shell than out on the open road.
So, do you live on an island too?
Nah. I was stuck on a boring old farm.
Then the trucks came, and they said I was too small to go.
But that's not gonna stop me.
You get to sit in a bucket.
What chicken doesn't want their own bucket?
I want a bucket.
The thing about us, Mol,
is that we wanna go where we wanna go whenever we want.
Yeah. With nobody telling us what we can and can't do.
Me and you, kidda. All the way.
Holy moly.
Hear that? It's like a party in there.
What is that?
You've never seen a human before?
We had them back at the farm.
[quietly] They're kinda stupid.
They fed us and tidied up after us. They're basically like waitin' staff.
Oi! -Oi, you! -Huh?
How did you two get out here?
-What do you say, Molly? -[Molly] Uh…
Do you want to come on the adventure of a lifetime or not?
-Oh no! -[Rocky] Oh no!
-[yelps] -Molly!
Ginger!
-[indistinct chatter] -Molly!
I know what you're thinking.
Where are the buckets?
I bet they give 'em to us when we get there.
-Are we nearly there yet? -Molly!
Hello.
[groans] There go the goujons!
-Hang on, Fowler! -What do you think I'm doing?
[gasps] Molly!
-Well, hey. That doesn't look so bad. -[Ginger scoffs]
-Oh, that looks so bad. -[group gasps]
Right. Stop here.
-[brakes screech] -Let's have a look.
-Okay, all clear. -On your way.
-[electricity crackles] -[moth squeaks, groans]
We mustn't panic.
-No. No panicking. -I don't like it.
It's a perfect time to panic. The enemy has the upper hand.
We must keep our heads!
-Where should we keep them? -[splutters] I'm trying to think here.
-No panicking. No. I said no panicking! -[Ginger sighs]
-Ginger, what do you say? -[Bunty] What did I say?
I say, last time, we broke out of a chicken farm.
Well, this time, we're breaking in.
-[hen 1] It smells funny. -[hen 2] This is not what I expected.
-This is, uh… cool, isn't it? -[tense music playing]
[man] That's it, my lovelies.
Come on down.
-[both scream] -I don't fancy that. -Come on. -Huh?
Over here.
-[both] Wow. -[hen 4 screams]
Did I promise you the adventure of a lifetime or what?
-Come on. Let's play. -[Molly giggles]
-[Molly] Yeah! -[Frizzle squeals]
Let's go in the pool.
Listen, everyone. We can do this.
-We just need a really clever plan. -Ooh. Ooh.
Okay. I've got this. I've got this.
[slowly] I'm gonna go in there, and I'm gonna bust Molly out.
And just how the bloomin' heck are you going to do that?
Well, by, uh… uh, y'know, going in there
and then… busting her out.
That's not a plan.
That's just saying what you wish would happen.
Aye, and 12 herrings and a bagpipe
are just a pile of mince if you havnae kent the rules.
You know, that sounded a little negative to me.
Mac's right. We need more details.
We only get one shot at this, so we need to make sure
that every move we make is carefully thought through.
We can't just rush in and…
-[Rocky grunting] -Uh, Rocky?
What are you doing?
Sometimes you just gotta take a leap, Ginger.
-You ready, Fowler? -Ready.
-Fire. -Rocky.
Cock-a-doodle…
Ooh, that went well.
Well, one good thing.
At least now we've got the details.
[sighs] Right. We're gonna need some backup.
No way. That place is impenetrable.
Yeah, and you can't get in neither.
It's an impossible mission.
Uh, shouldn't it be the other way around?
[sighs] Don't be a 'nana, Fetch.
I know it looks like a million-to-one shot,
but we know the layout, and Mac thinks there's a way in.
This is Fun Land Farm.
It's much smaller than I expected.
Uh, thanks, Babs.
There's a wee side door in a blind spot.
With a cheeky wee trick to open it.
So, only the small matter of this electric fence.
All these guards.
The camera-driven gun-toting moles.
And the laser-guided exploding ducks.
Please. You've got to help us. Rocky's in there.
Ah, shame. I quite liked him.
And so is Molly.
Molly? Our little niece? [gasps]
Steady, mate.
-Stay strong. -[breathing shakily]
-So you're in? -[splutters] Just tell us what you need.
-[trumpeting blow] -Anything for our little Molly!
We can do this, everyone.
Bunty, with your strength, my love, we can move mountains.
Mac, you're the brains.
Babs, you're our… wool specialist.
Nick and Fetch,
you're the sneakiest little toerags this side of the Dales.
-You're too kind. -[chuckles] Flatterer.
And, Fowler, with your wisdom and vigilance…
-[music stops] -Fowler?
Ooh. [splutters] And then the second wave of bombers approach the target,
and that's where I come in.
Actually, Fowler, we need to find something special for you.
-[whimsical music playing] -Ah, right.
How about… getaway man?
Getaway man, eh?
Hmm. [clicks tongue] Sounds important.
I like it.
Right. Let's gather what we need and hurry.
Who knows what horrors Molly is dealing with in there.
-[hen 1] Wow! -This place is fun!
-It's the most amazin' place ever. -[Molly sighs]
And my mum said that's where we live.
[scoffs] Yeah, right.
Are the streets paved with marshmallows where you live?
Can ya bounce on them?
-No! They're paved with dirt. -[upbeat music playing]
-[Molly grunts] -Can you lie around doin' nothin' all day?
Actually, my dad can.
Well, everyone can do that here. [gasps]
Wow.
I've heard of this, but I never knew it actually existed.
Cool. What is it?
All-you-can-eat buffet.
Cooler than a penguin's toenails. [giggles]
-Right? -[hen 2 gobbles]
It's just, back home, I had jobs to do.
[Molly] I helped Mac with the harvester, helped Bunty pick carrots,
made yarn with Babs.
But here, it's just play.
And then more play.
I wonder if they're missing me.
It's great, innit? We're free to do whatever we want.
Come on!
Sorry.
Uh… Frizzle!
There's actually something strange about this place.
I'll say.
Ever seen anything like this before?
[man] Oh no, what's this?
You aren't supposed to be back there, number…
[clicks tongue] Hmm. You don't have a number?
We don't want chickens making any trouble here.
-Especially not today. -[tense music swells]
Okay, everyone. It's go time.
It's all right. I went before we left.
What the… Huh?
No, you mug.
[quietly] It's upside down.
Oh right.
Go! Go! Go!
-[radio beeps] -Yup?
-[guard] All clear. -[Babs yelps]
[Ginger] Let's go.
[grunts] Perfect landin'. Right on the button.
Right on the button?
Mm. Okay.
[Nick] Let me out!
[Mac] The camera!
I've got it. [grunts]
[Fowler] "Getaway man," she said.
More like taxi driver for a couple of rats. [groans]
There. Textbook landing.
At ease, soldier.
I reckon they think I'm too old for this caper.
Some rambling old rooster who's easily distracted.
Hm. Oh, actually, there's quite an amusing story about that.
One time, I was out rambling…
Well, on maneuvers, and…
All right.
I'm inside.
[Rocky, pained] Get off of me.
Nick, uh, I don't wanna worry you, but I think your bum just spoke. -[Rocky grunts, sighs] -[both] Huh?
Guys? What are you doin' here?
[both] Rocky!
We're with Ginger. Uh, we've come to rescue ya.
[chuckles] Rescue me?
No, no. I'm doing the rescuing.
I'm not being rescued.
I am rescuing Molly.
How's that going, then?
-Well… [chuckles] -[whirring]
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but you guys are just gonna hold me back.
I tend to work alone.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, the Lone Free Ranger. [chuckles]
Right? And I am close.
I can feel it.
I'm gettin' warm, boys.
Really warm, actually.
-[door squeaks] -[sniffs] Can anyone smell roast chicken?
[Rocky] I said you'd hold me back!
[Nick] Oh dear.
[sighs] We actually planned that.
-Did we? -[Rocky groans]
Okay. I've gotta go find Molly.
[spluttering] Molly?
Hold it back, son. Hold it back.
Look at them.
-It's like they're all a bit… brainless. -[hen 2] Ah.
Erm. I don't think I like it here.
Yeah. It's not as much fun as it looked on the poster, is it?
[gasps] Hey, Frizzle.
Maybe we should try and find out what's going on in this place.
[gasps] Now, that sounds like a real adventure.
Come on. Let's investigate.
Come on, now, you naughty little thing. [laughs]
I'm just your big chicken friend who only wants you to be happy.
Frizzle! [gasps]
What was that?
Hello.
Who are you?
What? [scoffs]
It's me. Molly.
-Frizzle, what's this? -[grunting]
Come on, Frizzle.
We've got to go. [gasps]
But I've never been so happy.
[Molly] No.
[softly] I'm big…
…and I'm brave.
-[spring rider squeaks] -[Molly] Frizzle.
[quietly] Listen. I'm going to find out what's going on here.
Then I will be back.
I promise.
Dr. Fry, your guest has arrived.
[Fry gasps] Sir Eat-a-Lot.
Right.
It's showtime.
Ah, Sir Eat-a-Lot! Welcome. [chuckles]
What an honor to have a knight of the realm with us.
Actually, Sir Eat-a-Lot is just the name of the restaurant.
My name is… Oh.
[splutters] Here at Fun Land Farms,
we do everything we can to make our chickens feel right at home.
Well, I must say, I've never seen a farm like this before, Dr. Fry.
Is all this security really necessary?
[Fry] Oh yes.
Molly.
You see, behind these doors are secrets
that will change the world of poultry technology forever.
Come on.
[panting] No!
Oi, what are you lot doing?
-[all] Attack! -[guard groans]
This place is a maze.
How am I ever gonna find Molly in here?
-There she is. -[Rocky] Huh?
Molly?
Molly! Molly!
[Fry] And, um, how's the restaurant business?
[Smith] Actually, a little slow.
[chuckling] Oh well, I think we can help you with that.
Molly! [yells]
No! No!
Molly! Molly! Molly!
Ah. Ginger?
Right. I'm gone.
Well, can't we just take the lift?
All I can say, Dr. Fry, is this had better be…
good.
My, uh, partner will be joining us shortly.
In the meantime, we've prepared a little presentation. [chuckles]
Please, be seated.
[narrator] This is an ordinary chicken.
Plain, dull, and easily frightened. -[horn honks] -[panicked clucking]
[narrator] Like any simpleminded creature,
its natural instincts, when faced with processing,
is fear and panic.
[narrator] When this occurs, the muscles tense,
which cause the connective tissues to form knots.
[narrator] The result?
Meat that is tough, dry, and flavorless.
Mummy, this meat is tough, dry, and flavorless.
-I hate you, Mummy. -Oh!
Molly.
[narrator] Fear not, underappreciated mother.
For what if science could change all that?
For what if science could alter a chicken's response to fear?
[narrator] What if it could make a chicken happy to be processed?
[narrator] Then you'd say, "Well done, science."
[narrator] Because a happy chicken
is a tasty chicken.
This is the most delicious chicken in the whole wide world.
I love you, Mummy.
Thank you, science.
[whispering] Molly.
That's a clever little cartoon, Dr. Fry.
But will you be able to do it?
[woman, echoing] We already have.
-[gasps] That voice. -[footsteps approaching]
Allow me to introduce my wife.
[Fry] Melisha Tweedy.
Welcome to the future.
It's her.
Darling, this is Sir Eat-a-Lot.
The name is Reginald Smith.
Sir Eat-a-Lot is just the name of the restaurant chain.
Hello, Reginald.
I see you've met my current husband, Dr. Fry.
Was I attracted to his large inheritance and vast acres of land?
No, it was his mind.
You probably can't tell by looking at him, but he's a genius.
You flatter me, darling. [chuckles]
With degrees from Oxford and Cambridge in clinical neurology,
With degrees from Oxford and Cambridge in clinical neurology, behavioral psychology, genetic engineering…
And drama!
Now you've had the appetizer,
time for the main course.
Come.
Molly, no. Get back.
[grunting, muffled] Let me go!
Right. Try and find Molly.
-[control panel beeping] -Oh, look.
Rocky and the rats are on telly.
Looks like a real cliffhanger.
-[Bunty grunts] -Where is she?
[Fry] Oh, look.
They like the new egg cup ride.
[quietly] Frizzle.
[gasps] Mum?
Oh, Mollypod.
-Are you okay? -Yes.
Promise never to run away again.
-Did they hurt you? -I'm fine, but I think they eat…
-[Mrs. Tweedy] Come on. Get on with it. -Shh.
[Fry] Right you are, pumpkin.
Behold.
[dramatically] The remote control.
-And the other remote controls. -[Mrs. Tweedy grunts]
Why three?
-Nobody knows. -[Mrs. Tweedy grunts]
Let's go with…
that one.
-Why am I playing golf? -Where am I?
-What am I doing? -Molly? Where are you, Molly?
What's going on?
[splutters] No, no, no. Wrong one, my angel.
-That's the off button. [chuckles] -[remote beeps]
Allow me. [chuckles]
-[gasps] It's me. -[joyful fanfare playing] [collared hens] Whoa!
[hen 1] She's won the prize.
Oh wow.
[all] What a lucky ducky!
[quietly] No. Stop.
-[collared chickens] -[Ginger] Run, chicken! Run!
[collared chickens] Bye!
[collared chickens] Have a nice time!
Look at me, and do not look away.
Behold,
the dawn of the nugget.
[smacks lips] I love you, Mummy.
Um… Um, I… I… I mean, it's delicious.
Picture it.
-On every street, in every town. -[Ginger gasps]
People on the go.
Modern people in a modern world.
They want their food, and they want it fast.
And we will give it to them by the bucketful.
Fast food. I like it. This could be big.
No. It will be huge.
And Melisha Tweedy will have her revenge.
Revenge?
Revenue. That's what I meant.
I'll send a truck to collect the first batch at dawn tomorrow.
With my nuggets and your chain of restaurants,
this is going to be a beautiful partnership.
Uh, shall I see you to your car, Your Sirness?
Come on. Let's get out of here.
No, wait. We can't go without Frizzle.
Frizzle? Who's Frizzle?
She's my friend. I can't just leave her.
I promised I'd come back.
Please, Molly. You don't understand.
But you saw what happens. She'll die.
And if we don't leave here now, then we will die too.
I don't care. I'm not leaving her here.
You are just a child,
and you have no idea who you're dealing with. -[footsteps approach] -[gasps]
-[shouts] -Bye-bye.
You!
Come back here!
Well now, the little escape artist.
-[grunting] -[Mrs. Tweedy] You won't ruin this.
-Not again. -[Molly gasps]
-[feedback squeals] -Come back immediately, Doctor.
And bring a collar.
-We've an unexpected guest. -[Ginger straining]
[weakly] Stop.
You're pushin' us too hard, cuz.
I ain't been this knackered
since I took that hamster wheel for a test-drive.
-[Mrs. Tweedy] Here she is. -Shh. Listen.
[Mrs. Tweedy] The miserable, malcontented chicken that escaped Tweedy's Farm
and ruined my life.
[Bunty] What is this bloomin' place?
-[buttons beeping] -Molly, where are you? -[Mrs. Tweedy cackles on monitor] -[group gasps]
-[guard grunts] -[Babs] Ooh! He's laddered me knitting.
[Mac] Run!
[Mrs. Tweedy] I gave you all a hen could want.
A warm hut,
all the feed you could eat.
-But you still weren't happy. -[buttons beep]
-Well, I'm gonna make ya happy now. -[knob clicks]
[gasps] Mum.
I've gotta get in there.
Ah, I've got an idea.
-You're the Lone Free Ranger, right? -Yeah.
You used to get shot out of a cannon, right?
That is all… Why?
It's not working. Turn up the power.
The equipment's in good order, my love.
I've just never seen a chicken so strong-willed.
[Mrs. Tweedy] You don't know the half of it.
-Turn it up to full power. -[buttons beep]
Full power?
But we've never tested it at that. [groans]
-Must I do everything myself? -[gasps]
Husbands and chickens, the bane of my life.
-[Fetcher grunts] -Sure you can make this work?
Oh yeah. There is nothing Fetch don't know about electrics.
He could chew through wiring before he could walk.
-Ready. -Great work, boys.
I'm ready to fly.
Goodbye, cuz.
Or should I say, "au revoir."
It's more likely goodbye, to be honest.
Let's go. [grunts]
Come on, Mum.
-[collar beeps] -Mum? Who's Mum?
You are. And we have to get out of here.
[vacantly] Why? I love it here.
I'm so happy. [laughs]
No.
[exhales] Dad?
Molly.
Right.
[chuckles] He's got some moves.
♪ We can't fly, we are chickens! ♪
Get him.
-Come here, you. -[guard 1] Oi!
Hey! Get him.
-Find those chickens! -[guard 2 whines]
[Ginger, deliriously] ♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y! ♪
-♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y! ♪ -[Molly grunting]
♪ I know I am! I'm sure I am! ♪
-♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y! ♪ -[sighs]
-Come on! -Shush, Mum. We have to be quiet.
-But I want to sing! -Shh!
-[whispering] Just follow me. [grunts] -Oh, goody.
-Are we going on holiday? -[groans]
No, we have to find Frizzle and Dad and get out of here.
But why? [whines, groans]
-Because I say so. -[blows raspberry]
Well, you're not the boss of me.
-I can see my feet. -[grunts]
[guard 2] Where'd they go?
-Come on, Mum. -[guard 2] Come on!
-[guard 2] This way! -[Ginger] Cooee!
Wait up!
-[group panting] -Come on. Let's get a shimmy on.
Ginger. Oh, thank heavens you escaped.
I can't believe we're back up against that horrible woman.
What? Mrs. Tweedy's the best.
-I love her. -[Molly] Bunty.
-Mac. It's this collar. -[Ginger] She's the loveliest.
-It's making Mum act weird. -[Ginger] The bestest.
-[both] Molly! -[guard grunts]
-[Babs] Ooh! -Cooee! -[grunts] Huh? -[screaming above]
-Ha. Got him. -Uncle Nick?
Uncle Fetch.
How did you find us?
-We just fell down the air vent. -Love, Molly.
Love showed us the way.
-[whirring] -[Ginger] Going up.
-[laughs] Cooee! -[Bunty] Ginger!
-[Molly] Mum! -[Ginger exclaims]
-♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y ♪ -[group groans]
♪ I know I am ♪
-♪ I'm sure I am ♪ -It won't budge.
-♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y ♪ -Ooh. Babs, what's in your bag?
Uh, not much, I'm afraid.
[Mac] Magic.
The very dab.
[laughs] That tickles.
[echoing] It's like being inside a giant biscuit tin.
But without any biscuits.
I've lost my specs.
I cannae see a sausage.
-[gentle music playing] -Mum?
Mum!
[weakly] Molly?
[gasps] You're okay.
Oh, Molly.
What happened? Where are we?
Don't know, but there's no way out.
There's never no way out.
Where's Rocky?
I saw him back in that big room.
[sighs] He saved us.
He did?
-[all straining] -Come on. We can do it this time.
I can't hold this much longer.
Fetcher, quickly!
Find a ledge or a crack to grab hold of!
[Fetcher] Righto.
Ooh! Not that crack.
[sighs] Face the facts, duck.
We need a miracle to get out of here.
-[Rocky] Hey! Anyone down there? -[Ginger gasps]
-[Molly] Dad! -[Ginger] Rocky!
[laughs] Do not tell him he's our miracle. There'll be no living with him.
Rocky is on the case.
[group] No! Don't jump!
-[group shouting] -What? What's that?
I can't hear you! Wait. I'm comin' down!
Don't jump!
-Oh! Family hug! -[Molly gasps, grunts]
Oh, I missed you guys.
Okay. Well, let's blow this henhouse and head home.
That's the way out, isn't it?
I am so sorry.
Molly, what's wrong?
This is all my fault.
I should have listened to you and done what I was told.
Now everything is a mess.
[sighs] Hey, where's my big, brave girl?
[sighs] That girl's stupid.
You were right.
If we ever get home, I'll just stay there and never leave. Ever.
Hey, no. Molly.
This is my fault.
I should not have told you all of that ridiculous Lone Free Ranger stuff.
No, this is on me.
I used to hate being fenced in.
So why did I expect you to be any different?
I guess I was afraid you were so much like me.
What's wrong with being like you?
Nothing. -Because your mom is the best. -[sighs]
And she always has a plan.
Not this time.
[sighs] He's here.
-Are we ready to fry, Fry? -[buttons beeping]
Five minutes, pumpkin. [chuckles]
-Make it four. -[Fry, shakily] Oh.
Where is she? -[bell dings] -Hmm?
Them runaway chickens, uh, have got themselves stuck in a corn silo.
In the silo, you say?
Excellent. I'll go and greet our guest.
Production starts in three minutes.
Looks like you've just run out of cluck, little chickens.
I think there's a grinder at the bottom of this thing.
On the plus side, though, we will all probably drown
before we're ground into tiny, wee pieces.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Popcorn. [chuckles nervously]
Popcorn, everyone. Look. Look, popcorn. [laughs]
Rocky, I don't think this is the time to…
The answer to all life's problems.
Of course.
Mac, we need heat.
-Lots of it. -[Mac] Oh.
Will this work? [grunts]
[grunts] Perfect.
[grunts] Now, does anyone have a match?
Yeah, you and a raving lunatic.
-You'll blow us all to bits. -[Molly gasps]
Besides, we've used the last one.
Oh no.
[gasps] That's my girl.
Um, can I once again raise my health and safety concerns?
What is it?
All right.
Mm. That tastes nice.
Is there any more?
[Fowler] But guess what?
Just as Whizzbang Charlie thought we were back in Blighty,
enemy fire at six o'clock.
-[whimsical music playing] -Ye gods. It's raining popcorn?
Good old British weather.
Unpredictable.
You never know what's coming.
Outrageous.
-Get in there! -We made it.
-Look. -[Fetcher] Whoo-hoo!
Fowler's only gone and set up our escape route.
-[bright music playing] -Well done, you old sausage.
Firm handshake will do, thank you.
[laughs] Mission accomplished. Now let's fly this crazy coop, huh?
[Babs] Oh yes.
[Fetcher] Oh, look, Nick.
Have we got snacks for the way home?
[guard] All right. On you go.
Ginger, are you coming?
No, I'm not.
I'm going back.
For Frizzle?
For Frizzle and all the chickens.
-Yes! -[laughs, sighs]
Just because where we live is cut off from the world doesn't mean we are too.
No chicken is an island.
We are with you, Ginger.
Aye, me too.
Me four.
The rats are in.
Right. What's the plan, Mum?
Oh, well, I didn't think you…
Rocky.
Hey, Molly, um, are you sure you're ready for this?
-I was hatched ready, Dad. -[sighs]
She is a lot like me.
-[guard groans] -Dr. Fry! What was that noise up on the roof?
-[guard grunts, thuds] -Sounded like an explosion.
[gasps, yelps] Looks like one of the silos has blown its top. -[alarm blaring] -Oh.
Maybe you shouldn't have put those chickens through the grinder, my love.
Don't be ridiculous.
[Smith] Melisha, all ready for the big day?
[cheerfully] Oh yes, Reginald.
Everything is tickety-boo.
[Smith] Jolly good. My truck is ready to go.
We've got to move fast.
While Tweedy is busy with her guest outside,
we sneak back in.
Molly, you take Bunty, Babs and Mac to where all the chickens are.
Come on.
-This way. -[Babs] Ah.
[Ginger] Stay out of sight and get ready to stop the chickens going up that staircase.
Rocky, we've got to get hold of that button.
-[remote beeps] -[Ginger] And disable those collars.
[Ginger] As soon as the collars are off,
Molly's team leads the chickens out of there.
-We bust our way out. -[hens clamoring]
Steal the truck,
then we're home free.
Well, what are we waiting for?
-All right. Let's do this. -We're doing it today, are we?
[Fowler] So where was I? Ah, yes.
Whizzbang Charlie had lost his undercarriage,
and the old crate was catching fire…
Actually, Melisha, I have a little something for our big day.
[sweetly] Why, Reginald, this is all very sudden.
Ketchup?
Oh. No, no.
Something completely new.
I call it "the dip."
[swallows] It's… sweet.
And sour.
Aren't we all, Reginald?
-[Mrs. Tweedy on radio] Dr. Fry? -[gasps]
Yes, my beloved?
Say those words I am longing to hear.
Get on with it, you idiot.
It's the funky chicken and the ginger one too.
[gasps] Oh no, my wife will not be happy with this.
Come on here now, you naughty little chickens! [yelps]
[groans, muffled] Oh dear.
See you on the flip side, egghead. [laughs] You get it?
[Mrs. Tweedy on radio] Dr. Fry? What's going on up there?
Quick. Come on.
-[Mrs. Tweedy] Dr. Fry! Dr. Fry! -[Fry whimpering]
-[Fry] Hello? -Dr. Fry!
-[Fry] Anybody there? -Dr. Fry!
-[bell dings] -Dr. Fry!
Where are my nuggets?
Honestly, that man is about as much use as a headless… -[Fry shrieks] -[Mrs. Tweedy huffs]
Chicken!
Let's make some nuggets.
Oh no.
No. This is not good, Mac.
-Oh, Frizzle. Where are you? -[Frizzle] Ooh!
My turn. Bye-bye.
Frizzle!
-[Molly panting] -Lovely sunshine.
-No, wait. -Hold on to her.
Mac, hurry.
[panting] I got it. I got it.
-[Mrs. Tweedy grunts] -[groans] I don't got it!
Rocky.
Go, Ginger!
[hens singing along] ♪ We're all goin' on a summer holiday ♪
-♪ No more workin' for a week or two… ♪ -[hen cheers]
Come on, everybody. We're goin' on holiday.
No, Babs.
They're going to turn everyone into nuggets.
♪ We're going Where the sun shines brightly… ♪
-Not now, mate. -[yelps]
Please, Mac. Hurry.
Nearly done.
-Just one more bit of jiggerypokery, and… -[straining]
[grunts] What happened? What's goin' on?
Frizzle, this isn't the best place ever.
You only get your own bucket when they've chopped you up and cooked you.
And you came back for me?
Of course.
It's me and you, kidda. All the way.
-[hens] Time to go! -[both gasp]
[Mac] Try to push them back!
-[Bunty] There's too many! -[Babs] Ooh!
Is this one of the activities?
[Molly] Mum!
[gasps] Ginger!
Look. There's all the buckets!
-[music swells] -[Molly] The button!
That's it.
Frizzle, get on Bunty's shoulders.
What?
Trust me.
-[strains] Up ya get. -[Frizzle grunts]
-[heroic music playing] -Good goin', Molly.
Good job, Molly!
-[Rocky] Molly? -[gasps]
I got this, Dad. Help Mum.
Molly, watch out.
What have we here?
-A little you. -[groans] Mum, catch.
-They're going over, Mum! -[friends grunting]
Ginger, we can't hold them!
-[Mrs. Tweedy snarls] -You can't wait, Mum. Do it now!
Sometimes…
you've just got to take a leap.
No!
-[Rocky] Cock-a-doodle-doo! -[Mrs. Tweedy] Huh? [yelps]
No! No! No!
Ginger!
[Rocky] I got ya. I got ya.
-[Mrs. Tweedy] Well, now. -[Rocky gasps]
I suppose you three might make a bucketful.
Bye-bye.
Again.
Come on.
-Ugh. What's taking so long? -[guard grunts]
So much for fast food.
That's funny. Sounds like a…
-[shouts] …stampede! -[hens clamoring]
-Get your skates on. -Move your tail feathers.
-[Babs] Come on. -[Rocky] Come on!
You sure you know how this works?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Go, stop, and a spare one?
Come on! We have to go!
Full speed ahead!
Wrong way!
What gear are you in?
Oh, I call this "smart casual."
-[groans] Ah, you there! -[nugget thuds]
-What kind of crazy henhouse is this? -[nugget groaning]
[hesitates] Melisha?
Why are you dressed like a nugget?
[Ginger] There's the exit!
-Get her off! -[group strains]
I think they're gonna need a bigger bucket.
-[Fowler] Chocks away! -Huh?
T.I. Fowler, Getaway Division. Reporting for duty.
Where would we be without you, Fowler?
[panting] Darling! Darling!
-Blech. [groans] -[Fry] Darling!
The processor is dangerously overheating. [inhales, hesitates] Oh.
Pumpkin, watch out for the, uh… -[explosion blasts] -[yelps]
-[Fetcher] Oh blast! -[Nick] What?
[Fetcher] I think I left my umbrella in there.
Oh! The best thing about going on holiday is getting back home, isn't it?
[chuckles] Yes, it is. Isn't it, Babs?
-[Bunty] Oh! -All fixed.
-Just had a screw loose. -[ratcheting]
Good to have a bucket or two handy in case you're feeling peckish.
[hen] Plenty for everyone.
This makes you happy and brainless, apparently.
Oh yeah, I feel it.
[laughs, inhales] It's amazin'.
Mate, I haven't turned it on yet.
Well, it looks like we've finally got our happy ending.
Ah, let's just call this our happy beginning.
Sergeant Molly, reporting from reconnaissance.
Chicken farm, beyond the north field.
Thirty birds to a cage.
Poor little kiddas.
Right, everyone.
I don't like this one bit.
It's go time.
I've just got one question.
Is crowing back on the agenda?
Oh, definitely.
Ready, everyone?
They say it's extinct, but there have been reports of recent new sightings.
-Those reports haven't been confirmed. -Yes, sir.
There hasn't even been a decent photo taken of it.
[researcher 2] Unfortunately true.
[excavator 1] It's Mew.
Having phenomenal powers that can cause massive flooding,
or plant life to bloom in the wild,
bestowing some of these powers on humankind.
[researcher 1] Is it good or evil?
[researcher 2] Is it doing this on a whim?
No matter what, one thing is for certain. It wields great power.
[excavator 1] This is the fossil we just excavated.
-It's from the body of Mew! -[excavator 1] That's our theory.
Let's get this back to the lab immediately!
If it truly is a Mew fossil... [Dr. Fuji] Then we may be able to recreate the most powerful of all Pokémon!
[Dr. Fuji] Then we may be able to recreate the most powerful of all Pokémon!
[Mewtwo] Where am I?
Who... am I?
Who are you?
I cannot forget the world...
where a certain someone flew away from me.
Who... am I?
Why am I here?
No.
I am simply here.
That is all.
I haven't emerged into this world.
[researcher 1] It's finally awakened!
Mewtwo!
Mewtwo?
Hm. -Telepathy. -Ah.
Mewtwo. That is your name. We have given life to you,
using the rarest of Pokémon as a basis.
Yes. That is the rarest of the world's Pokémon, Mew.
Yes. That is the rarest of the world's Pokémon, Mew. Mew...
Would that be my parent? My father? My mother?
My father? My mother?
-Maybe either or maybe neither. -Huh.
[Dr. Fuji] Your existence is based on Mew, but you were created to be even stronger.
[Mewtwo] Who created me? Neither father nor mother?
Then nature?
Then, are you saying that I was created by nature?
In this world, only two things can create life,
nature and human science.
You did? You humans made me?
-It's a triumph of science! -It's proof we were right all along!
[lab tech 3] We can continue our research!
Who am I?
Where am I?
For what purpose was I created?
[Dr. Fuji] Everyone, we need to leave immediately!
[lab tech 2] Go, go, go!
Creating the most powerful Pokémon in the world,
it was our goal and ultimate dream!
[Mewtwo] Is this my power?
Am I the most powerful Pokémon in the world?
Mew... am I stronger than you?
Hm? It's true that you may be the world's most powerful Pokémon.
But the world has one other powerful life-form.
Humans.
If you were to join forces with humans, the world would belong to us.
The world would belong to us.
However, if you were to simply let your powers loose,
the world's destruction would be the only outcome.
Your powers must be controlled.
-Controlled? -Will you let them run wild
and do to the world the same thing you did to this island?
What must I do?
You place armor on me that protects me, yet holds back my power.
After all of this, what do you expect of me?
[Giovanni] It's simple. You only need to do what everyone in this world does.
And what is that?
Destruction, war and conquest.
The strong will stand victorious.
[Mewtwo] Where am I?
Who am I?
For what reason do I fight?
For what reason do I live?
You are a Pokémon.
Pokémon are used for human purposes.
They live for humans' sake.
Are you telling me to fight for you?
Is that what you mean?
Are you saying I must fight for humans?
You are a Pokémon that was created by humans.
What other value could you have?
[Mewtwo] Value?
Who am I?
For what reason do I live?
What is this?
You dare to defy humans?
I was created by humans.
But I am not human!
And as an artificial Pokémon, I am not a Pokémon either!
Who am I?
Where am I? Who wanted me to be created?
Who asked for me to be created?
I despise everything connected with my creation!
And so...
this is neither attack, nor declaration of war.
You are the ones who created me.
And I will strike back... against you!
[narrator] This young man is Ash from Pallet Town.
He's traveling with friends on a training journey,
aiming to become a Pokémon Master.
[all] Wow! -I can smell the sea! -[squeals]
The view is great here.
-Why don't we have lunch? -All right! [giggles]
-Man, am I starving. -Pikachu.
Even after extra helpings at the Pokémon Center this morning?
-That was breakfast! This is lunch! -Pika-Pika.
You can't battle on an empty stomach, right?
-Eating is part of training. -Oh yeah! You said it!
-That's our Brock! -Pikachu.
Just be sure to help with setting the table.
-Sure! I'm all over it! -Pika-Pika!
Aw, I'm out of gas!
But, Ash, you know we're not done!
I'm so hungry, I can't move another muscle.
-Oh, come on! -Misty?
You have to let it simmer slowly until it's just right.
You can't rush stew, or Pokémon, for that matter. Hm.
[pirate] Hey! You, little boy! Are you Ash from Pallet Town?
Huh? Yeah, that's right.
Okay! Does that mean we can have a Pokémon battle?
Okay! If somebody wants to battle, why not?
What happened to the guy who couldn't move a muscle?
I can have a Pokémon battle before breakfast. -Maybe two! -Pika-Pika.
You're forgetting one thing. You're battling before lunch.
-Pika-Pika! -Yeah! We did it!
He just had a weak opponent...
-Who didn't know you can't rush a Pokémon. -[Togepi squeaks]
Pikachu is getting ever more skilled by the minute!
Oh! Gorgeous!
We've got to get our paws on that Pikachu
and grab it for Team Rocket, no matter what!
[James] Mm. But there's more. Just look at that spread!
Here, Togepi. Say, ah! -Togepi! -Taste good?
-Am I hungry... -I've got a frying pan.
But without something to fry, it's little more than a round anvil made out of iron!
it's little more than a round anvil made out of iron!
[servant] That's Ash from Pallet Town.
And with him are Misty, the Cerulean City Gym Leader,
and Brock, the Pewter City Gym Leader.
Master, shall we invite these people as well?
As you wish, Master.
Hey, who are you?
Hey! Don't do that! Stop!
[laughs] Charizard never changes.
-[Togepi squeals] -Hm. Oh, well...
This is for me?
Please forgive this surprise message from a stranger.
She's so beautiful! I can't believe it!
You three have been acknowledged as up-and-coming Trainers.
As such, you are invited to a party held by my master,
the world's greatest Pokémon Trainer.
The location? Pokémon Palace, on New Island.
We ask that you RSVP, whether attending or not,
by checking the box on the return card.
The greatest Pokémon Trainer alive invites you.
We beg you to accept.
-Whoa! The pretty lady just... -What do you think?
-I think we should go! I know we should! -She called us up and coming.
-I think we should go! I know we should! -She called us up and coming. -I don't think that sounds bad at all! -Pika.
So, you're going to mark the RSVP yes?
-I sure am! -Uh-huh.
It's bad manners to rush by without even a hello!
-What's this? -Huh?
-Calm down, Raticate! -Kingler?
-And the weather was so nice before! -Seaside weather can change in an instant.
Huh? What? The ferry's grounded? -So we can't go to New Island? -[boy] After getting an invitation?
-So we can't go to New Island? -[boy] After getting an invitation?
Please, quiet, everyone! We have the harbor manager right here.
I'm Miranda. If you want to hear the will of the sea, listen to the harbor Wingull.
But there's no need. Listen to these winds.
I've never seen a hurricane like this in my life.
Is it really that bad?
I grew up near this harbor and I've never experienced a storm like this.
And not only that, the storm is directly over New Island, far out to sea.
I cannot in good conscience allow you to wander into such obvious danger.
I beg you, as one sworn to protect the harbor.
You heard her. The ferry for today is canceled.
Well, I'm going to New Island anyway!
My Pokémon are great swimmers!
-We'll make it to that palace, no problem! -No!
-I know the sea and I am telling you no! -She's right!
If one of your Pokémon is wounded,
the Pokémon Center here won't be able to help it!
-[all gasp] -What does that mean?
Nurse Joy from the Pokémon Center, she disappeared a week ago.
And with Nurse Joy missing, your Pokémon won't be treated.
Look. There's the missing-person poster.
So pretty. [sighs]
Huh? Haven't I seen her somewhere before?
No, don't! Stop, or I'll have to arrest you!
No.
-I knew we couldn't stop all of them. -Huh?
They're Pokémon Trainers. Adventurers.
They never would've come here if they'd known they'd be stopped.
Here's to their safety.
The greatest Trainer in the world is out there across the sea.
-We've just got to get over there! -Pika! Pika!
But, Ash, we don't have any Pokémon that can cross such an angry sea.
-Yeah, you're right. -Pikachu...

Is this boat really safe, bobbing in all these waves?
It's just like taking a bath.
Wet at first, but soon, you'll take to it.
Captain! Isn't it about time?
Aye-aye!
[chuckles] With one click.
I've heard of being wet behind the ears, but this is nuts!
It's you three! [mumbles]
Team Rocket!
It was about time for you guys to show up.
Why are you here?
-Prepare for trouble, what a thing to say. -And make it double...
[Misty gasps] Where's Ash and Pikachu?
Whoa. Do you see that?
-Thanks a lot, Staryu. -[Togepi squeals]
-Squirtle, you were great! -Squirtle! Squirtle!
My compliments on your arrival.
Present your invitation, if you would please.
These three are the recipients of the invitation.
-Huh. I knew it! So it was you after all. -What?
You're Nurse Joy, from the harbor poster.
[Misty] Come to think of it, they do look alike.
[servant] I don't understand.
I have been a servant here at this palace ever since the beginning.
Now, if you will follow me.
The other invited guests have already arrived.
These are the other guests I was telling you about.
Wait. Just three of them?
But there were so many more on the ferry landing.
If a Trainer couldn't make it here through the storm,
then they wouldn't have been invited.
[Brock] Are you saying that the storm was a test?
Please release your Pokémon from their Poké Balls and take a seat.
The six of you who have gathered, you are all chosen Trainers.
Okay, how do we get into the palace, eh?
Our only choice is to go in through the exit.
But I don't see one.
Down there.
[Meowth] A sewer?
-Sewers are not my habitat! -They are now!
There's no other way, so toughen up!
-[James] Uh, what's wrong? -[Jessie] Nothing. Let's go.
[all] ♪ Climbing the scary rail Live to tell the tale! ♪
♪ Climbing the scary rail... ♪
So you made it here, too?
-So did you. But how? -We simply took to the skies.
A little hurricane means nothing to Pidgeot, does it?
Everyone, say hello.
I just rode over here on Gyarados' back!
Isn't Gyarados known as the Atrocious Pokémon?
I'm here with this one and those over there.
Just lovely.
Blastoise, Dewgong, Vileplume, Ninetales,
Blastoise, Dewgong, Vileplume, Ninetales, Rapidash and your Wigglytuff, too!
Rapidash and your Wigglytuff, too!

My lady, once this storm passes, let's gaze upon the sun-drenched seas
and eat my famous jelly donuts made with love... [grunts]
Yeah, yeah, if you're going to eat, you're better off eating alone.
Thank you all.
I'd now like to present the world's strongest Pokémon Trainer,
who will now join you.
-What is that? -Pika?
-[Jessie] Meowth! -Huh? [pants]
So, my master is not only the strongest Pokémon Trainer,
but also the strongest Pokémon in existence... Mewtwo.
-Mewtwo? -Pika.
A Pokémon can't be a Pokémon Trainer! No way!
-[both] Are you sure? -What's that voice?
-It's telepathy. -[all gasp]
[both] I am the one who chooses my own rules.
If this is a bad joke, I'm going home!
[groans] Get it, Gyarados!
[gasps] Gyarados, use Hyper Beam!
Gyarados!
[both] That was trivial.
-[gasps] -[Mewtwo] I have no more use for you.
-I knew it. Nurse Joy! -Where am I?
What am I doing here?
[Mew-two] I brought you here from the Pokémon Center to look after me.
It is convenient to have an expert well versed
It is convenient to have an expert well versed in the physiology of a Pokémon's body.
You were quite useful.
-I suppose you remember nothing, correct? -What did you say?
With my power, it is easy to control something as simple as the human brain.
-That's just awful! -Pika!
[Jessie] What kind of place is this?
[James] It doesn't look like a treasure vault.
-How cute can you get? -You think that's cute?
[Dr. Fuji] Our research has produced a device that can make clones of Pokémon.
With this, we found great success.
-What's going on? [yelps] -[Jessie] Meowth! Meowth!
Wait! Stop that thing!
[whimpers] Look what you did to my precious fur!
[Jessie] Three hairs.
[Dr. Fuji] It needn't be much.
If we can study a Pokémon's tissue, we can make a clone of that Pokémon.
-[James] Who's that Pokémon? -[Jessie] It's Meowth!
Whoa! -[Jessie and James] Meowth? -[Meowth] But I'm Meowth.
-[Jessie and James] Meowth? -[Meowth] But I'm Meowth.
[Jessie] Then this is...
-[James] A Meowth clone? -[Meowth] Please!
[Dr. Fuji] However, one clone I made was different from the rest.
From the Mythical Pokémon Mew, found deep in the jungle,
we discovered the tiniest of fossils.
And from that, I was able to bring forth Mewtwo,
creating the most powerful Pokémon in the world.
That was our dream.
However...
[Jessie] Then this...
[James] Is a lab for creating Pokémon clones?
[Meowth] Wait, why isn't there anybody here?
Maybe it's their day off.
If that's true, they must need it.
Man...
[Mewtwo] At one point, I thought I'd work alongside humans.
But I was disappointed.
Humans are a dangerous species, inferior even to Pokémon.
If cruel, weak humans are allowed to govern the planet,
the world is headed for ruin.
Who will rule the world? I suppose a Pokémon like you?
Pokémon are unfit as well.
After all, they allowed humans to rule in the first place.
For some Pokémon, the purpose of their lives is to serve humans.
What's this? You say you do not serve this human?
That you are with him because you like this Trainer?
Pika! You are as pathetic as the rest.
-Pikachu? -Pika-pi!
Weak Pokémon nestle under a human's wing.
-[Misty] Ash! Are you all right? -Yeah.
How dare you do that to Pikachu! No matter the Pokémon,
there shouldn't be any Pokémon that can't be caught!
-Go! Rhyhorn, I choose you! -[Rhyhorn grunts]
-[Corey] Rhyhorn! -Wigglytuff.
A waste of time.
Since my creation, I've been far stronger than any Pokémon alive!
You sure? You never know until you try!
You want to try?
-[all gasp] -[Meowth] I'm not liking this at all.
-[James] What was that? -[Meowth] Beats me.
[Jessie] It said "mew".
[Mewtwo] Humans aspiring to become Pokémon Trainers,
first choose from three Pokémon anyone can get.
Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Charmander.
These before you are their evolved forms.
-They are my copies. -Copies? Huh?
-A battle arena! -Are we being challenged to a battle?
I choose to battle with Bruteroot the Venusaur!
And my partner? I choose Shellshocker!
Me, too! Charizard, I choose you!
-Charizard! I didn't say start. -Pika. Pika.
Your Charizard is poorly trained.
Which of you will oppose me first?
I underestimated you once, but that won't happen again!
Go, Bruteroot! Use Razor Leaf!
Use Vine Whip.
Use Energy Ball!
Yes!
Use Leaf Storm.
[gasps and pants] Bruteroot!
Are you okay?
I'm battling you now!
Go, Shellshocker! Use Skull Bash!
-Blastoise! -[Mewtwo] Use Skull Bash.
Shellshocker, use Hydro Pump!
Shellshocker!
Ash, be careful! Their moves are really strong!
Yeah, I know! But don't worry.
None of those attacks can hurt you as long as they don't hit you!
-Okay, Charizard! Win it with speed! -[Charizard growls]
-How are you going to win it with speed? -Ugh. They're too fast.
Charizard!
Use Seismic Toss.
-Charizard! [pants] -[Pikachu] Pika!
It seems you lack both speed and power.
Shellshocker!
-Bruteroot! -Are you trying to steal our Pokémon?
Steal? No.
I am only making more useful, stronger clones
from these Pokémon, of which you are so proud.
-[gasps] -Making clones? -Stop it! You can't do that! -Do not attempt to defy me!
-Stop it! You can't do that! -Do not attempt to defy me!
I make my own rules!
-Here they come! -Run, everybody!
Gyarados!
Seadra!
We've just got to get them into their Poké Balls!
A waste of time.
-Bulbasaur, Squirtle, return! -Bulbasaur.
Got 'em!
That's not possible.
Anything is possible with the Poké Balls I make!
-[Misty] Be very quiet in there. -Togepi.
Psyduck! No! Psyduck!
Psyduck...
-Vulpix! No! -[Nurse Joy gasps]
-Pikachu, run away. -Pikachu!
Don't let them get you! Pikachu!
Pikachu!
[yells] Ah! Pikachu!
[Jessie and James] Who's that Pokémon?
It's Scyther!
It's Dewgong!
It's Vileplume!
[Meowth] Sandslash. Nidoqueen. Vaporeon.
And then of course, this one's Meowth.
[both] It's the Twerp!
I don't have time for your dumb motto today!
-Wait! -Hey!
[Jessie and James] Who's that Pokémon?
It's Pikachu.
-Pika. -Pikachu.
[Jessie and James] Whoa! Look at all the copies.
-There's no stopping them. -Send in the clones.
-Those are... clones? -Pika?
Huh? The originals too?
[all] Stay out of my space!
Squirtle!
-Squirtle! -Pika! Pika!
-Bulbasaur! -Pikachu! Pika!
Humans, I have no desire to cause you harm.
Simply go home now!
That is, if you can make it home through the storm.
What was that?
[Ash] You can't do this.
I won't let you!
-It's Ash! -All right!
-It's Psyduck! -Vulpix!
You set them free?
That's right. I had to.
I'll protect all my friends!
-Ash, oh, no! -Stop it now!
What is this?
-Is that...? -A Pokémon?
Mew...
I've read about that one.
Right. It's the Mythical Pokémon.
[Mewtwo] Mew, said to be the only one of its kind
and the strongest Pokémon alive.
Mew?
-So, it does exist. -Yes.
[Mewtwo] However, I am the strongest Pokémon!
I may have been made from part of you. But now I will prove that Mewtwo is better than the original,
But now I will prove that Mewtwo is better than the original,
superior to Mew!
Mew and Mewtwo...
Then Mewtwo was made from Mew.
This world is too small for two of us!
Why do you flee from me?
Are you afraid to find out which of us is greater?
[Mewtwo] So you do have some fight in you.
But I have no time for games. Destiny is at hand!
But I have no time for games. Destiny is at hand! Who will rule? My super Pokémon?
Who will rule? My super Pokémon?
Or your pathetic group of inferior Pokémon?
We were created with powers far stronger than the originals!
-Hm, it's talking truth. -Translation?
[Meowth] Mew says you don't prove anything by showing off a lot of fancy moves.
The Pokémon's real strength comes from the heart!
A Pokémon's real strength, you say? [grunts]
Very well! My clones don't need moves to prove their worth!
Now we shall see who triumphs!
What good is this fighting?
They're either originals or copies!
But they're all alive!
This is wrong.
Even if they're copies, they're all living in the same world.
Originals and copies. They're all living creatures!
Does winning or losing really matter?
[James] We tell others to prepare for trouble, but I'm not prepared for this.
It troubles my heart to see them all this way.
It seems like they're only hurting themselves.
-It's like seeing your old self... -Battling with your present self.
A blast-off bad dream!
I'll bet these claws hurt.
You've got a lot of nerve being here, you know?
The rest are duking it out!
Eh? You're telling me I've got even more nerve?
Just 'cause I'm not duking it out?
Oh, so you think my claws would hurt a lot, too.
Well, your claws would hurt a lot more, you know.
[Meowth] You want to know if tonight's gonna be a full moon?
Yup. I think tonight is gonna be a full moon, filled to the top!
[Meowth] Wow. Thinking of the moon at a time like this...
You know, palley, you've got class.
[gasps] Pikachu!
Stop, please! Knock it off!
-[Brock] Ash! -[Misty] Ash!
[pants] I've got to stop this! You can't.
Until Mew and Mewtwo stop, the fighting goes on.
Living things won't give up their territory
to other members of their own species.
That means...
They'll battle until one is defeated... till only one remains!
That's how living things are?
But Mewtwo was created by humans.
And yet, it's a living thing.
They're alive, all right. Both Mew and Mewtwo.
And Pikachu!
And the other Pikachu too!
Will you guys stop?
Knock it off!
-What's going on? -What happened?
Foolishness! A human would actually attempt to stop our battle?
Oh, no, Ash...
Pikachu.
-[Ash laughs] -Pika-Pi! -Pikachu. -Pikachu!
It is true that both you and I are living beings... Pokémon.
I see now that the circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant.
It is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are.
Mewtwo, where will you go?
Where my heart can learn what yours knows so well.
What transpired here, I will always remember.
But perhaps for you, these events are best forgotten.
Please, quiet, everyone! No boats will leave the harbor!
This hurricane is stronger than any seen here before.
You must evacuate!
Aw, why right now?
Please remain calm and I'll do my best to help.
The Pokémon Center will function as a shelter, open to anyone!
The Pokémon Center will function as a shelter, open to anyone! Come with me, if you wish to use it.
Nurse Joy, Officer Jenny, Miranda, too!
The rainwater hardly blurs their radiant beauty!
Huh? Why are we here in the first place?
It doesn't make any sense.
Well, since we're already here, who cares? -Togepi! -[laughter]
-Yeah. Right! -Pika!
Like it never happened!
-No hurricane... -It disappeared!
-The ships can sail first thing tomorrow. -Right.
-Oh, what's that? -What's what?
-You see that? Just up there! -Pika?
I didn't see anything at all.
Nothing but clouds.
[Ash] On the day I set out and decided to become a Pokémon Master,
I saw a really rare Pokémon, just like I did now.
Well, then maybe you'll see that one again sometime.
-Huh? -That really rare Pokémon!
Mm. One day, for sure!
[narrator] The world of Pokémon, full of mysteries and legends
and the stories of those who dream of becoming Pokémon Trainers,
as well as the amazing Pokémon who live, work and battle by their sides.
As the journey continues, for a long time to come!
Beautiful! Everything clean and natural!
Pristine, untouched!
Now, that's a big change.
EVERYTHING IN THIS STORY IS FICTIONAL.

Excuse me. I think that's my seat.
Here you go.
They often make mistakes.
-I wonder if that was it? -Yeah.
Sometimes they sell the same seat twice, maybe...
It was empty, so I took it because I didn't want to go backwards.
Hello?
Gözde, I got on.
I got on. I'm on the train.
On the Blue Train.
I don't know. I guess someone stole it. It's all gone.
I guess I'll just go to the wedding nude now, Gözde.
I don't know. I'll figure it out when I get off.
I'll do it when I get off.
Gözde, do you think your clothes will fit me?
Geez, you're just like my mom. Stop the nonsense.
Gözde, sweetheart, I told you.
I don't know who stole it. All right.
I don't know who stole it. Talk to you later.
All right. Bye.
Sorry to hear what happened.
Your luggage is gone...
Were you eavesdropping?
It's hard not to.
I was just curious about something. What's your seat number?
It's three. Is that okay? Three?
Is three all right?
Don't get me wrong, but that's also my seat.
-My friend's seat actually -What the hell?
But, it's okay. No problem.
They're not coming.
I have to be in Izmir by tomorrow night and the train is full.
Is that good enough?
What?
I have to be in Izmir tomorrow and the train's full.
Is that good enough? Can we just leave it at that?
Then I should just forgive you. What do you mean?
You know how you got upset, "What the hell?" and all.
I'm just saying, I guess I should forgive you.
Well, yes... I had a bad day.
Your luggage is gone. Yep.
-And you can't go backwards. -Why are you dwelling on this?
Why do you think?
Okay, look, can I go to Izmir in here or not? That's the question.
The answer should be that clear, right?
No, I mean...
You obviously can. But am I allowed to stay or not?
That's the real question.
I don't understand.
I mean, you have this attitude...
What attitude?
Good evening.
-Good evening. -Can I have your names?
Ali Kaynar.
Kaynar...
Ali Kaynar.
Okay. And yours?
Kavak.
Kavak. I don't have anyone by that name.
I made a mistake and bought my ticket for tomorrow.
Ayhan Adalı. Type it, sir. Ayhan Adalı.
Ayhan Adalı. Yes. The lady is Mr. Ayhan Adalı?
How can she be Mr. Ayhan, sir? What's your name?
Mehmet.
Mr. Mehmet, I bought this compartment with my friends.
Four of us. Check the names.
Seyhan.
Rasim.
Ayhan. See?
It's our compartment anyway. My friends couldn't make it.
Are you married? We're engaged, sir.
Because a man and woman are not allowed to travel like this.
Sir, she didn't let us go to Izmir, man to man.
She got all uneasy.
The system wouldn't have worked with a woman's name.
What can we do, sir?
I have to issue a fine to the lady.
That's okay. How much is the fine?
It's going to be about 85 liras. Let me check.
Okay, go ahead. Write up the fine.
-89.50 liras. -Here you go.
Here you go.
Thanks.
Have a good trip.
So, what attitude do I have?
Like, "Even if I don't explain myself, people will understand..."
-Really? -That's the image so far.
What was the point of buying four tickets?
Is that the type a person you think I am?
The type of person who would buy four tickets
so he could travel alone in the train?
I don't know what to think.
-My friends were supposed to be here. -So they ditched you?
They couldn't make it.
You should've canceled then. People with emergencies couldn't get tickets!
They should take a plane. Who'd take the train?
It's a ten-hour trip.
Maybe they're afraid of flying.
They should get a bus, then.
Maybe their luggage got stolen at the terminal.
What's about getting on a train without a ticket?
I have a ticket... For tomorrow.
-What do you mean? Should I leave? -You already tried that.
-What is it that you want? -Maybe a "Thank you"?
Thank you. You're welcome.
Unfortunately, I have bad news.
I can't go backwards, either.
No problem. I'll manage.
By the way, I'm Ali.
-What? -I'm Ali. It's a pleasure.
-My stomach... -Are you okay?
PART TWO
Let me help you.
-Let's keep you out of this now. -Good thing it didn't get on your clothes.
Good evening Ms. Şebnem.
I looked at it. Actually, I left it on your desk.
Well...
Rather than the GSM operator, the guy is at fault here.
He builds a cell tower and makes it look like a water tank.
Puts it on the roof with the sign "water tank."
The pictures are in the folder.
Someone took them from the roof across the street.
You can see the cables...
It's obvious it's a cell tower.
Exactly. That's what I wrote in the petition.
Okay.
I'm on my way now.
My friend's wedding.
We'll see.
Have a good evening, Ms. Şebnem.
So, a guy puts up a cell tower and covers it up as a water tank?
Yes. The whole neighborhood's rising up.
They have tree-shaped ones too.
Don't even know if it's causing any harm or not.
Are you a lawyer? For now.
Is the smell gone?
I didn't smell it when I came back.
This is awful. Sorry.
Don't be. It's clear you shouldn't travel backwards.
"Before you embark on a journey of revenge,
also dig a second grave for yourself."
I bought it, but I didn't like it.
-Just wanted to see whose book it is. -It's mine.
-Are we still in primary school? -No.
And that's why we don't go through each other's bags, right?
"Good day, sir! I'd like to get revenge." "Here, we have a written one."
I didn't read it, though.
How about all the notes and writing?
I got it from a secondhand store.
Why did you get revenge from the poor secondhand store?
Are all these jokes from law school?
Nope. All mine.
Not getting a perverted vibe here. I might think you're hitting on me.
Still not sure. It's strange.
Just asking.
Because you're a lawyer? Just making conversation.
Well, what for? I'm curious.
Most people are not curious. But I am.
Like, I'm curious about why you're here. What's the deal?
But you don't stop there.
-What do you mean? -You ask a lot of questions.
But it's not easy. It takes listening.
Well, naturally.
People don't do that either. They don't listen.
We have so many flaws, right?
There might be less flaws if we listened.
We're in the same compartment on a 14-hour trip.
Who am I? What am I? Am I some kind of pervert?
Don't you want to know anything about me?
You're Ali. You gave me a seat. Thanks.
You're a lawyer. You friends didn't come. Going to a wedding.
-Wedding? -That's what you said on the phone.
-You totally eavesdropped. -I overheard it.
Also, it's kind of obvious. Your suit and all.
And you pretend you're not curious. Why do you hide it? Just ask.
I even wonder about someone in front of me at the bank.
-You just go up to them and ask? -Depends.
Do they drink tea or coffee?
Do they... like warm sea waters or cold?
-Do they squeeze lemon on fish? -You can't do that.
Right? You see that? Start of a conversation.
Do you have to have a conversation?
I get bored.
Which is better: a fantastic chicken döner or a mediocre beef döner?
Can we not talk about street food?
Go to Anamur with your boyfriend or Paris with your friend?
You're always like this?
I could ask something else. What did you lose in the luggage?
Don't remind me. Everything.
Everything. It wouldn't fit.
I mean, how could everything fit in a piece of luggage?
Also, not everything is gone. You have your bag.
You have your music.
If that was gone too, I'd kill myself. It's an 89-year-old violin.
Sometimes it's good to lose everything.
Like, when you move. You get rid of useless things.
What's in your bag?
The usual stuff.
What if it gets stolen here?
I would hardly miss anything.
So why do you carry it, right?
I guess you have a point.
There is no limit to curiosity, then?
-Maritime Law. -What I'm studying.
Why? You're a fish out of water?
Cemal Süreya.
-Two books! -I like reading him.
We have a drug warehouse.
Red glasses.
Prescription glasses.
Would you like one? We have ten hours. How else are we going to pass time?
That's your deal? You hop on the train, get all high on drugs and party?
-What are those? -Hüseyin.
The pills, I mean.
-It's Hüseyin. -Who's Hüseyin?
Hüseyin is the pill.
Everything's Gonna Be Great?
You know, it was in the movie. The pill. Hüseyin.
"Whose name is Hüseyin?" "The pill is named Hüseyin."
You didn't see Everything's Gonna Be Great?
What does this Hüseyin do?
-It's heart medication. -You have a broken heart?
Hüseyin is my doctor.
What if I had taken it?
There is no "Why are you taking heart medication?"
No "Get well soon."
Only "What if I had taken it?"
But I did ask. I asked if you had a broken heart.
I had a heart attack when I was 14.
A heart attack happens at that age?
You have a heart at every age.
What are you doing?
I guess I can't hear it from here. Ticktock?
-Not everyone knows that. -My grandma has it.
I don't have a pacemaker. Mine is different.
I used to hear it every time I hugged her. It's a strange feeling.
Shit.
-Fuck. -What?
What is it?
Her pills were in the luggage. They're gone, too.
Damn.
My sister brought them from the USA.
They dissolve in the intestines or something.
-Is she ill? -No.
So, why are you in a rush to get to Izmir?
I'm going to a wedding too.
-Is it a surprise wedding? -What do you mean?
You said you had to go to a wedding. Didn't you know where and when?
Just a figure of speech. You know how I got on the train last minute and all.
What if it's the same wedding? Whose is it?
It's none of your business?
You know I'm going to a wedding too. That's why.
Just a friend's wedding.
Where? Is it in Izmir?
Nope. Where's yours?
In Urla.
The bride's side?
-I'm not even invited. -Well, then...
My ex is getting married.
I wish them all the best.
-She's making a mistake. -What can she do?
-She should change her mind. -And then?
-She should come back to me. -Wow!
Because I'm the one who truly loves her. Not the prick she's about to marry.
So you're crashing the wedding?
You're exaggerating.
So you're just going to watch from a distance?
I have things to say to the bride.
Like what?
"Don't get married"?
"Be with me"? What are you going to say?
That I have two weeks to live.
She's getting married out of spite. She's making a mistake.
You're going to kidnap the bride.
There's no kidnapping.
I can't miss something like this.
Give me the address so I can come.
Ortaköy Resort.
Ortaköy Resort.
Are those really heart meds?
And I'm Leyla.
Imagine if I threw up too?
So, are you serious?
About what?
About having two weeks left?
Not really. But we can never know, right? It could happen.
PART THREE
By the request you made to our office, you asked to get married.
We have examined your documents and found no legal reason
for you not to get married.
Now I would like you
to repeat that you want to get married in the presence of the witness and guests.
Now, Ms. Müjde Ar,
with no pressure from anyone and no influence from anyone,
with your own will, do you accept marrying your fiancé, Şener Şen?
-I do. -No!
-Dad! -Wait. Stop this wedding.
What are you going to offer this time, you bastard?
No, son. This marriage cannot happen.
You can't stop us anymore.
I'm not the one stopping you, my daughter.
-It's God. -What do you mean?
You can never get married. Because...
You're brother and sister.
-You think of something like this, right? -Naturally.
What would you like?
I think we should get some Raki for my friend.
I'm afraid it's prohibited to serve alcohol on trains.
I'd like a cup of coffee.
-And Turkish coffee for me. -We only have instant coffee.
How can you not have Turkish coffee?
-The machine's broken. -Why not use a coffee pot?
We're getting one coffee for the lady too. Two cups of coffee: one black, one white.
I don't want it. None for me. I'll just have some water.
One black, then.
-Why did you assume I take milk in mine? -Just took a guess.
So, where did you meet this girl?
Are you always like this? You talk to people like you're scolding them.
Where? In Urla. At my aunt's summer house.
In Urla. At my aunt's summer house. Summer love.
No, fall.
-I had an interview for a job. -In Urla?
There are no lawyers in Urla?
Do lawyers look for jobs?
There is a Technopark in Urla.
One of the companies there was looking for a lawyer for their legal department.
You know, I had just graduated.
-I see. And then? -I applied, went to Urla...
My aunt has a house there.
Then I applied for the interview. I went there. Then...
I went there. Then, they hired me. So I started working...
How did you meet the girl?
-Should we talk about something else? -Like what?
I don't know. Isn't this weird? Why am I talking about it now?
It's a good topic. What else can we talk about?
How did your love begin?
Here you go. "How did your love begin?"
What do you mean, "How did your love begin?"
Why don't you ask how it went instead of how it began?
It seems yours didn't go anywhere, that's why.
-That's the point. -What?
People think love just happens instantly.
They think love is about the beginning. No one's...
interested in maintaining the love.
All right.
I believe love is something you can succeed at.
-And you're unsuccessful? -Maybe I am.
But it's something you can learn.
Then tell me whichever part of this romance you want to tell.
I mean, if I can't ask you how your love started,
-tell me what kind of person she is. -Why do you want to know?
It's exactly what you do. I got curious, so I started a conversation.
What's she like?
"What's she like?" She's...
Golden. She's well-educated, you know...
She was staying at the resort. I...
My aunt knew her family. I had heard about her before.
Totally arranged, then.
I totally arranged to see her by the pool...
-That's where you fell for her. -No.
That's where she caught my eye.
-Are you like that? -How?
You instantly fall for them, like bang!
You never know, maybe...
-She caught your eye. Then? -Yes. She's the type that draws attention.
-What's her name? -Burcu.
-Burcu what? -Burcu Sunay.
I mean, what's her zodiac sign?
Scorpio.
Oh, boy!
-What's your sign? -Leo.
That's my mom's sign too.
A bit headstrong, right?
-Who? -Leos.
Depends on the situation. Yes. What kind of person is Burcu?
There's something different about Burcu.
You'd understand if you met her. It's something special.
You know the type of person.
I don't. What type?
You know...
The one that...
The most popular kid in school. Everyone's favorite person.
Always on a high, always cheerful.
But not fake, all real.
Is that possible?
Always on a high, always real?
Burcu is.
Leo.
You saw her by the pool. Then?
We should just drop this completely.
You met, she's on a high, real. Then?
-Then we started dating. I checked. -Checked what?
-To see if it would work. -So you're making calculations?
Kind of like that. I never do anything on the fly.
Where's love in all this? Right in the middle.
-In everything she had me do. -Like?
-I'm not even invited and-- -Okay. What else?
I quit my job.
You got the girl. The job? So what.
When you put it that way, it sounds stupid but...
You can call it fate.
Fate? Like, destiny?
What are we even talking about?
In the final analysis, Burcu is not getting married willingly.
Your confidence is through the roof.
Are you married?
If I were, I wouldn't have the ring on my right hand.
Why did you ask?
I didn't want to be on the defense.
Where are you heading to? What's your deal? Mine is obvious now.
Mine?
I got nothing.
Is that possible?
What are your expectations, really?
That she'll decide not to marry the guy?
The wedding--
-Aren't you bored? -I'm curious about your expectations.
I guess we could take a break.
You were saying, "14-hour ride. How do we spend the time?"
Would you like something?
What are you thinking now?
Nothing.
Impossible. The world record is three seconds.
-What record? -The World Record for Thinking Nothing.
How do they measure it?
With a stopwatch.
I really wasn't thinking about anything.
-I don't have any expectations. -There. You were thinking.
I'll just go and tell her how I feel.
She will come or she won't.
Don't try to make it sound all innocent.
You're literally going there to crash the wedding, with the drama involved.
Can we not say "crash the wedding"?
Why? Is it illegal to kidnap a girl?
Look at you! You should have been a lawyer, too.
-Can I ask you something? -Yes, madam prosecutor?
Really, how will you do it? How will you trick her?
I don't need to. I will talk to her just as one should.
But how? Is there gonna be a show?
Or will you just go and talk to her directly? Head on?
-Forget about it. -I mean, the microphone stand and all?
-Let it go. -Come on. Are you being shy?
You don't have to know it all.
Who knows? Maybe you'll cut your wrists after the wedding.
You're not telling so you won't jinx it?
Okay.
Have any cigarettes?
I don't smoke.
Excuse me, can I borrow a cigarette?
Thanks.
Need anything, sir? We're closing.
No. How much do I owe you?
I need to check.
Go ahead.
PART FOUR
I'll tell you if you'll listen properly.
Yes, come in. So what is it?
That seat you're sitting in?
My friends were supposed to be here, but they didn't make it.
We were supposed to be on the way to Izmir together, with food, booze, and music.
Those guys have a band. A music band.
We were going to hold a pirate concert at the wedding.
Where and how was all decided.
Just before they say "I do," I was supposed to-- What is it?
I'm listening.
But those deserters didn't show.
Excuses like "Why are we going by train? Why can't we fly?"
They released two albums. Now they're big shots.
Burcu loves Cemal Süreya. So do I.
Poetry.
Like poetry poetry.
Not just any kind of poetry.
Let's go.
"You, liquid mirror, suffering insect.
Nutritious stain on my laundry.
The only legible part of my destiny.
Fearless happiness, solid anger. You...
Red onion who swallowed its uvula.
Big-hearted acacia.
A skirt with its thread pulled. With a little belly.
-You. Elisürencil." -"You. Elisürencil."
"If there is a word like that, that's the one.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
You just got off work. You're in Beşiktaş.
Who wouldn't want to be happy?
Are you also willing to be unhappy?"
Right there, Burcu was getting goosebumps, right, my dear Ali?
Burcu has never read any poems in her life, Ali.
She thinks Süreya is a pub! I read her his poem!
I'm the one who loves poems, Cemal Süreya, likes to eat crumpets cream in Afyon.
-What? -Dumbass Burcu
would laugh her ass off at this.
What do you think will happen?
You really think she'll dump that jerk Berke and run into your arms?
You think she has the capacity to get your love and affection?
Your poetry and all that crap?
Do you think Burcu deserves you going there to beg?
Who the hell are you?
What made you fall desperately in love with her?
Her ass like a washbowl...
or her slightly slanted eyes?
She left you for an idiotic egoist and now she's getting married to him!
Go and read your poem. Let's see what happens.
-Burcu sent you? -That's what you'd have hoped for?
Tell me the truth, did Burcu send you? Or that faggot Rasim?
Rasim? Burcu? You and I ran into each other by accident.
You're so full of yourself. So full of yourself.
Call Burcu. Tell her I'm not coming.
So you just give up?
What are you doing?
Ali.
You had me tell you everything. Like an idiot.
Ali.
Ali. Look, I'm serious.
It was really a coincidence. I have nothing to do with your stuff.
I know, I should've told you from the beginning.
You were talking about a wedding.
I just couldn't interrupt. Then we had a conversation going.
Okay, I'm sorry.
How could I know that you-- God, what are you doing getting off here?
-What are you going to do? -Get back.
I think you should go back. And why do you take me so seriously?
You got your thing going. What difference does it make if I know Burcu or not?
Ali!
-Two beers, sir. -It's past the legal time.
Sir, please, can you just give them to me?
We're going to get six, sir. And two whiskeys.
I have stuff to say as well.
Ali, the train is about to leave, come on. My bag is on it. Please.
Are you chickening out?
You run for the hills first chance you get.
Keep the change.
Is that why you didn't take the plane?
There are no stops. What are you going to do?
Jump out with a parachute? Ali!
What do you think you're doing?
Ali, don't be ridiculous. The train's about to leave.
My bag is on it.
And maybe it will end well.
What's that again?
Everything's gonna be great?
You're not gonna listen to me?
Come on.
Ali, the train's leaving.
-Ali! -You should run.
I don't want them to get married either!
Okay?
Fuck.
Damn it.
I don't want them to get married either.
I was with that jerk Berke for six years.
Do you understand now? Why I didn't say anything?
My violin's gone.
Get in.
Come on, we're catching it.
Come on, the violin is slipping away.
PART FIVE
We were together for six years.
Six years.
And do you know what he always used to tell me?
He used to say "I will never get married, girl."
He didn't see the point in getting married.
One morning, I left his place, went to my own apartment, took my shower.
Doorbell rang. A courier. He gives me a package.
I opened it and I saw a wedding invitation.
What?
"Burcu and Berke are inviting you to..."
-You guys were still together? -I told you, the morning I left his place.
He sends you a wedding invitation the same day?
Are you not listening?
Burcu sent the invitation. Otherwise, I wouldn't have known they were getting married.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have known they were getting married.
Holy crap!
You didn't get to know her well.
Is it possible that you threw a corkscrew at this dumbass's head?
It didn't hit him in the head.
Of course. The eye, right? It fell in front of him. I didn't even throw it.
It fell in front of him. I didn't even throw it.
That's not what I heard though.
So you're Violinist Leyla.
What did you hear?
Well, you had a huge fight. You almost poked his eye out.
Burcu told me.
And I guess you crashed the car into a wall once?
-I don't remember anything like that. -How come?
I just don't. If it's useless, I just erase it.
I thought people were making it up. So you really crashed the car.
I don't remember anything like that.
You're both in the car. You crash it and you forget it. How does that work?
Somehow my brain erases it if it wants to.
You have a delete button?
Hit the button and forget.
I wish I were like that.
What else do you know about me?
Why are you going to the wedding?
What do you actually expect?
I don't expect anything anymore.
I don't even have a dress. So maybe I won't.
And you should go and read your poem, and see what happens?
You still haven't told me what you expect.
Actually, I wasn't going to go.
But later, it hit me.
I want them both to know. I don't give a fuck about them.
So you're just going to make an appearance?
I want to be there for a change.
See their faces.
See what's it like to be there and see those two get married.
You still have a chance to change Berke's mind.
And you think you still have a chance with the girl.
Good for you, man!
You'll go there, read your poem, and get the girl? Really, good for you.
I'll have to think of something else. Seems she doesn't like poetry.
It's a whole new game now.
In this day and age... Bravo, brother.
My cousin kidnapped a girl from her wedding as well.
No kidnapping here, brother.
That's okay.
They'll charge you with detaining.
No, they won't.
But that's what it is.
If you detain someone, that's what you'll be charged.
If the girl isn't underage and is willing, nothing will happen.
He thinks the girl will come of her own will.
How did the cousin and the girl turn out?
Did they get married?
My cousin is still in prison.
I have no idea what happened to the girl.
They say she moved to Denizli, but who knows.
How about Turgut Uyar?
-What about him? -Do you like him?
I like him too.
But I like him, Ali.
Me.
PART SIX
Keep the change!
The violin is here. The violin.
My back is killing me.
Look! The Maritime Law is here.
You came back for The Maritime Law?
So you don't kill yourself.
For the violin.
How come we've never met before?
Why do you think?
Actually, I barely hung out with Burcu's friends.
How long were you guys together?
Approximately two years.
In that "approximately two years" how many times did you see her?
A lot. I was careful.
What does "a lot" mean?
You followed her to Istanbul?
Yeah. Then?
Then Burcu decides...
that she wants to go on a world tour
or tour Europe by train.
But you? I had to work.
I thought you quit your job for the girl.
You tell me, know-it-all.
Maybe not everything...
Unfortunately, I know quite a lot, but never mind.
Why? You didn't erase those? Just tell me.
Never mind.
Just tell me what you know.
Well, I'm getting firsthand information on this trip.
-What are you learning? -That you are a little aggressive.
She told you that?
Nope. I'm seeing it for myself.
Also, the corkscrew story.
And we have a forgotten car-crash story.
-There we go, the same story. -Then you tell me so I can find out.
You really want to know?
Let me tell you.
Where did Burcu...
stay in Milan, my dear Ali?
You do know.
Where did she stay in Milan those two months?
How were things between you?
It was good... I mean it was all right.
Where did Berke and Burcu meet, my dear Ali?
-They're old friends. -Nope.
That's what you think.
Burcu and Berke met in Milan.
Two days later, Burcu stayed at Berke's place.
At that time, we...
You were together, right?
That's what I thought.
I thought Burcu was my friend. I thought Berke was my boyfriend.
I was thinking, "How nice. Burcu won't be alone."
But Burcu...
took care of the business there,
and once back in Istanbul, they secretly kept it going.
You get it now? Neither of them told us anything.
That's why I say the girl is in love with an asshole.
She's getting married to a dick,
and following that dick, that asshole, and you're here...
Where is this button?
You know, the delete button that makes you forget?
Can I forget what you told me tonight?
Is this the button?
Easy.
Why did you tell me?
To make me give up?
You asked me to.
And I didn't want to hide anything anymore.
Invite me to your wedding, my darling
I can be your witness...
See? It's your song.
If anyone asks "Who is this guy?"
It goes well with whiskey.
You'll say "He's an old acquaintance"
Invite me to your wedding, my darling
I can be your witness if you want
If anyone asks "Who is this guy?"
You'll say...
What are you doing?
..."He's an old acquaintance"
Let's drink.
We had such dreams years ago...
Perfect timing.
Here. This is your song.
Three, four.
The ones that love, the ones that leave
I gave up everything
Thanks to you All my love is the talk of the town
So this is what they call the song of love
I will neither burn down the world Nor break the glasses
Thanks to you all I no longer believe in love
What they call love is a burnout, boy
I am not laughing nor getting mad Nor am I crying after her
Thanks to you all My heart is vexed with love
I am tired of whoring hearts
Neither deep as the ocean
Nor calm as the sky
Thanks to you all The ideas turned upside down
I am now afraid of the cogwheels turning
Come on
Oh, god
Why do I always come to you When I'm troubled?
Oh, god
Thanks to you all, I am always sighing
Oh, god
Why do I always come to you When I'm troubled?
Oh, god
Thanks to you all, I consumed love
Thanks to you all, I lost myself
Thanks to you all, I lost myself
Last time Nay-rina-nari-nirinom
Thanks to you all
"Nay, rina, nari, nirinom."
Nice words.
"Nay, rina, nari, nirinom."
Exactly.
Okay, this one's for you, then.
PART SEVEN
-Hello? What's going on, Mr. Lawyer? -Rasim?
-What's going on? You there? -One question, one answer.
What is it?
You know your junior-high buddy, the prick Berke.
Bro, he's not my buddy.
Rasim, did these two,
him and Burcu, screw me over in Milan?
Come on, Mr. Lawyer.
Did you know, Rasim?
Bro.
-Hello. -I'm here.
Did you know, Rasim?
Man, it was me who told you not to go, right?
Hang up, bro. We'll talk later.
Things are different there--
Holy cow!
I turned out to be the lonesome guy who got four tickets.
I had no idea.
Do you know why I got on this train?
I wanted something to happen.
Nothing's happened for a while. For a very long while.
Maybe since my heart attack.
Growing up, my parents always used to say,
"Don't do this, don't do that. You'll die."
So I grew up very early.
And, maybe, I died too early.
Doing the right thing, thinking about death all the time,
I feel like I'm going to implode.
And Burcu was really the only thing that happened in my life.
And everything other than her...
I made it happen, saying, "This is the right thing."
Not because I wanted it willingly...
Did anything I wanted ever happen?
No. I mean...
And when I want it,
I go read poems, like a child.
I mean, you-- It's completely fine. You know, you jeered me.
"A child reading poetry, going to the wedding to read poetry."
Yes, he's a child and he's going.
Because I thought something would happen with Burcu.
Because I wanted that.
I wanted to go back to the days when I was with Burcu.
I said "Okay, I'll be a restaurateur or a cook."
But now, I know. I don't want to.
Keep being a lawyer. Calling those jerks my friends.
Going back.
There are so many things I don't want now.
It's not good to want something so badly, you know?
If you do that,
then, you think life is all about that.
I mean, someone with only a hammer in their hand sees everything like a nail.
For example, our conservatory is just like that.
We start as a kid, because it's what you want as a kid.
Or it's what your mom wants the most.
For you to be a pianist, a dancer, a violinist.
Or maybe there's a show on TV, where everyone's famous and successful,
everyone's a pianist.
Anyway, you start school, you're a kid.
What happens next? You grow up.
All of a sudden, you're someone else.
You don't feel like playing the violin.
That happened to you?
Of course, kind of.
For a while, I wanted to a be a surfer.
That's not why you left, right?
What?
I mean, you didn't leave to be a surfer.
Was it Sweden or Switzerland? You can only...
be a skier.
Did Burcu tell you?
I guess you were supposed to move to Sweden with Berke, right?
Something like that.
What did she tell you exactly?
That you quit school, so you could go with him.
-That's not what happened, though. -Anyway, maybe not.
And you left your job for her.
It's not the same thing.
I left my job. You...
You left your life, your school, everything. Your music.
You left your life, your school, everything. Your music. -I still play. -That's not what Berke said.
-I still play. -That's not what Berke said.
What did Berke say?
He used to come and tell Burcu some stuff.
-And then she tells you? -Whatever.
I was with Berke for six years.
What are you even saying?
So, didn't he take off after that?
After what?
-Man! How did we get back to this again? -What? Tell me.
Whatever caused that scar on your arm, that incident.
Wow, you knew all this stuff, yet you kept quiet.
What Berke said, you know...
Stop beating around the bush and tell me now!
He couldn't tell you he wanted to break up after you got pregnant.
But he did tell me he didn't want kids.
We were still together after that.
He couldn't tell you. Sometimes you just can't.
How can he not say it for two years?
Is this what that son of a bitch, that asshole, tells people?
You should've just erased him too, then.
Since we got on, you've been talking about all this stuff!
You constantly remind me of the past.
"Constantly"?
-It's only been eight hours or so. -Don't remind me!
Don't remind me.
Leyla... I'm sorry.
Okay.
-Leyla, I'm sorry. -Okay!
-Sir, why did we stop? -We ran over an animal.
The engineers are checking for other casualties. We'll be moving soon.
Other casualties?
Something odd happened. I don't know exactly where we are.
I seems we ran over an animal.
Anyway,
we turn our cameras to Ms. Leyla.
Let's see what Ms. Leyla has to say
about the wedding tomorrow.
Ms. Leyla?
Ms. Leyla, what would you like to tell us about tonight's wedding?
See, everyone at the wedding is watching you.
Seventy-five million behind the screens.
Berke's here too. He's watching.
What would you like to tell him?
Ms. Leyla?
You're not talking?
Actually, I am not supposed to be here.
Now that I think about it, I can see how bad of an idea it is.
Because the person I called a friend...
is marrying my ex, who told me,
"I'm never going to get married, girl. I'm not that guy."
I thought about getting off and going the opposite direction.
I thought, the further the better.
But look at me. I'm here.
I even have an invitation.
An invitation.
You know the morning we woke up in your apartment, Berke?
Just the two of us, remember?
You told me, "Don't go, stay."
So I did.
It's been six years in that chair next to you, Berke.
To trust one person with all your hopes and dreams...
I know these are all ridiculous, but that's what I did.
I built all my hopes and dreams around you.
When you lose the only thing you have, you're left with nothing.
You desperately look for something to replace it.
Something...
Something you can say is yours, something you can cuddle with.
A piece of him.
I thought you were never getting married, Berke?
"An ultimately irrational institution," you said.
Et cetera. But look.
Ultimately, we're at your wedding.
The guy who told me he would never get married is getting married.
he would never get married is getting married.
I am only going to tell you one thing. Burcu, you listen too.
I think you're a horrible person, Berke. You truly are a bad person.
No one else in my life hurt me as bad as you did.
You're a bastard, a scumbag, a jerk, an asshole...
You're not even a dirty rat because rats are actually cute mammals.
At least they have emotions. You don't have that either.
I try to see you in everyone I meet.
We're leaving soon.
I can't trust anyone anymore because of you.
I can't fill the emptiness you left.
But I'm going to fucking take care of this, you'll see.
Everyone, to the train!
-Delete that. -Don't be ridiculous.
-Delete it now. -Keep it. It was great.
Can you give it to me?
-To the train! -Don't delete it.
Ali, can you give it to me? Ali!
What's the code?
-Okay, give it to me-- -What's the code?
-I'm really going to. -What's the code?
-Tell me the code. -You're really gonna delete it?
2758. Are you really gonna erase it? Leyla, don't.
All right.
PART EIGHT
-You're open? -Yes, sir, we are.
Can you turn off the music?
-Two teas. -Two teas.
Good morning.
Good morning.
That must be cold.
Can we get another tea?
When you give the order, we have to drink what you want, right?
With or without milk. Or tea.
-Maybe I'll drink coffee. -There's no coffeepot.
That's not the point, though, Ali.
Damn these never-ending issues.
You know how you order tea for me?
-Yes. -For me? Tea?
Because it's tea, you think...
Like milk coffee.
I only ordered tea. Okay.
Let's cancel it. Cancel the tea. What would you like?
It's not important at all what she wants though, right?
I wouldn't know. I'll ask her when I see her.
I don't think that's the case.
-What are you saying? -What I'm saying is...
You know, you're so sure she'll come with you...
That's what I thought until you came along, yes.
Yes, that's what I'm saying.
There is a person involved, Ali.
And she doesn't want you.
Life is not only about what you want.
You have a limit and...
your limit is the other person.
I mean, when you decide to travel with someone,
you can't decide where to go on your own.
I'm learning through experience.
It's the same for me.
It sounds a little funny. I mean, coming from you.
Why?
You've wasted a quarter of your life on someone else.
But I'm talking, right?
I guess you forgot.
I'm a master.
You know, I just hit the button and forget.
How bizarre. And I'm trying to remember.
Like, trying to remember what it was like to be 13.
Like, to want something again.
I wonder what it felt like to do something without checking if it's right or not?
It's really nothing to brag about.
I know from my own experiences.
When you grow up worrying about everything, you forget how it feels.
No matter what, we'd never know when our time is up, right?
I am only going to tell you one thing. Burcu, you listen too.
I think you're a horrible person, Berke. You truly are a bad person.
No one else in my life hurt me as bad as you did.
You're a bastard, a scumbag, a jerk, an asshole...
It's a smart phone.
When somebody else deletes it, it doesn't work.
At least turn it down.
Will we watch it all?
I try to see you in everyone I meet.
It didn't get deleted after all. We should...
Don't blame me.
You're the one who didn't erase it. Go ahead and delete it.
You do it.
Here.
Delete it.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Take it. Really.
Delete it.
Always ready to fight, right?
It doesn't lock.
It does lock.
Passengers, the train is about to arrive at Izmir, Alsancak Station.
So what are you gonna do now?
I think I'm going.
You are?
First, I'll go to my grandma's.
All right.
Goodbye.
It's just a ring.
Don't hit that button.
-What? -I mean, don't hit that button of yours.
It's a shame if we erase it right away.
Okay.
One more thing.
Nay-rina-nari-nirinom. You know.
Always.
THE END
OF THE PARTS
in 1947, they swept through India and changed its history.
India was split up, its spirit broken.
Some people ran from their homes to survive
and others started living in the abandoned villages.
On the border of Rajasthan,
Munabao is one such village.
I was posted here as a police inspector.
Many years passed by and my hair turned grey.
Crime was often just minor brawls,
and life was quite peaceful.
Then a whirlwind swept through this village
and things started changing again.
It was the year 1985.
I found myself in the eye of that storm.
Missed me so much, huh?
That bulge tells me you missed me too.
Come on! Let's do it quickly. We'll be killed if we get caught.
I may as well be dead
seeing you getting married and leaving.
-Where's Babita? -She's gone to the temple. She'll be back.
Bastard!
-What was that? -That's me, darling.
Here! Come on.
Hey! Bastards!
Stupid cunt.
Thought she could take on men.
Tell me the whole thing again.
I'd gone to the Goddess's temple to light lamps.
When I came back,
I found their bodies lying here.
You went to the temple alone?
My life is ruined…
-When's your wedding? -It was going to happen tomorrow!
Everything's gone. Money, the dowry items! They spared nothing.
When you came back, did you see anyone?
Did they threaten anyone in your family?
Girl, give us some details at least!
Look, we know that you know who they were.
Bhure.
Enough.
Let's go.
-Sir, she knows nothing. -She's lying.
She's going to get married soon. Why would she lie?
It's a matter of family honor.
She'd do her best to hide the truth.
This house was a drug storeroom.
The dacoits played us. Stole the dowry as a cover for the drugs.
You're great, sir.
Isn't he really great?
That's my move. It's your turn now.
Oy!
What do you want?
There's work in the city. I need literate men.
Why?
There's money to be made.
Our man, Panna, has worked in the city.
And he's literate too.
But he's not here right now.
That's his house.
Yes?
Wanted to meet Panna.
When will he be back?
There's a job in the city. He'll get good money.
He should be back in five or six days. He must bring in the harvest too.
What's your name?
Good Lord!
Sir.
Should we send the body for postmortem?
First, find out who he is.
Boy,
do you come here every day?
Have you seen anyone else around?
Do you know him?
Sir,
looks like the work of the same dacoits.
They're not dacoits, they're smugglers.
Bloody monsters! They tortured him to death.
A different breed of vultures is circling over Munabao.
Sir, we've found this on him.
Strange!
The killer left the opium but took his ear.
There's a photo here. Is there a name too?
This murder looks more like a warning.
What type?
Like a publicity poster for an upcoming film.
"Coming soon in the Thar.
For the first time on the big screen.
Full of blood, drugs, and violence.
A storm!"
Sir.
Put our informants to work.
We'll get some bloody leads at least!
Hello, sir.
Hello.
-Hello. -Hello.
Hello.
-Hello, sir. -All good?
-Two cups of tea, please. -Yes, sir. Right away.
-And some snacks for the boys. -Yes, sir.
Sir, never seen this fellow before.
Find out who he is.
Mister.
Do you have a light?
That's a fancy lighter! Can I borrow a cigarette?
Thanks.
You don't seem to be a local.
Sir, here's your tea.
Sir, he looks like a Hollywood star.
He's a businessman.
He deals in antiques.
I'm sure he has a name.
His name!
I've heard him say just four words.
"Tea. Snacks. How much?"
He comes and reads his papers in his regular corner.
Makhan.
Do you know him?
He…
He's Suva.
-Good evening, sir. -Good evening.
Hi.
-Hi. -Hi.
Don't try to be a supercop.
-Meaning? -Meaning!
Just ask questions, get your answers only using words.
Not your gun.
Don't overdo things.
-Hmm. -"Hmm"? That's it?
You were staring at the ceiling the whole night.
Come back safe, okay?
I've been hearing this for 25 years now.
"Come back safe!"
And playing it safe is probably why
I've never got promoted.
A promotion that gets you dead is of no use.
-It's pointless talking to you. -Then don't.
Do what I say. It's good for us.
-What are you doing? -Studying.
Don't study too hard. You'll pass.
So? I'll become an IPS officer.
And then, I'll come here as your boss and give you orders.
Yeah! That's all that I need. Even you ordering me around.
Be it dacoity, drug mafia, or something else.
I want this entire area to be cleaned up.
The SP is hounding me. You need to handle this.
Yes, sir.
When we were kids, dacoits were rebels from so-called lower castes.
Devotees of Goddess Bhavani.
They were principled, unlike these people.
Whatever they are, find them.
I'm a Rajput, not a Nawab.
Can't bend over for the SP or the minister.
Give me some time, sir. The investigation is on.
You're just an inspector.
And you'd retire as one in a few months.
You couldn't care less.
But I want to become the DG.
So whether they're dacoits or smugglers, kill everyone and close this case.
Good boy, Tiger! You should go get the dacoits!
Grab them and bring them in. Just like that. Ain't that right, Tiger?
Come on!
Calling you "Tiger" doesn't make you one.
You're still just a dog!
He's not back yet.
Listen!
He'll be back in a day or two.
Hold on, if possible.
He can do this job of yours.
I was preparing butter today to make ghee.
Got a fresh batch of buttermilk. Try some. It'll cool you down.
Has that tramp lost her mind?
Leave it be. Who'll argue with that childless woman?
She'll yell at us instead. Let Panna come. He'll set her straight.
Have you ever sat on an "EAGLE WAGON"?
What's that?
The one that flies in the air.
Yes.
Didn't you get scared?
No.
He sent a telegram saying he'll come by the morning bus today.
But he isn't here yet. If he could, he'd never return.
When newly married, they wouldn't let us out of the bed.
And now, they hardly come home.
Sorry! I was unaware you had a guest. I--
Wait! What was your name again?
Siddharth.
Right, Mr. Siddharth.
I'd told you about him.
I see.
This is Gauri. Dhanna's wife.
I'll get going now.
Listen. Please don't hire anybody else.
He has sent a telegram today. He'll surely be back in a day or two.
He's got such deep eyes.
He's a good man.
Here we are…
-Should we stop for some tea? -Stop the bus!
Stop!
Come, hurry up.
Panna, grab this.
-What… -Get me my bag.
-That's mine. -Very heavy!
-Oh, boy! -Come on.
Hey, Panna, Kanwar!
-Take this. -How are you doing?
Hey.
Long time, buddy!
-What's up, Makhan? -You're a rich man these days!
Hey, Makhan, my man!
I heard you made a fortune in Kolkata.
-Feeling jealous or what? -Oh, come on! Come, sit.
-Where's Dhanna? -He's waiting for his salary in Kolkata.
Hey, you! Take your goat outside.
You've grown up quick.
-I've got a sealed bottle of whiskey. -Really?
Some shit went down three days ago. Your friend was killed and hanged.
-Which friend? -Suva.
The motherfuckers chopped both his ears and tongue.
Hacked open his chest with an ax and hung him from the tree.
What… Who did this? Dacoits?
No idea. The inspector wants to meet you three.
He asked me to inform you.
-I told him Suva was your friend. -Motherfucker!
Why the fuck did you say that?
-We've been in Kolkata for eight months. -Yes.
MANPURA POLICE STATION
-Greetings, sir. -Greetings, sir.
-He looks like a kid. -Sir, we know that's Suva.
But we can't say it for sure.
I had my photograph taken ten years ago for my passport.
The passport wasn't made, but take a look at this photo.
No one can really tell that it's me.
But that's me, for sure.
Scorched under the sun, we age 20 years in just two, sir.
Not everyone has movie-star good looks, after all.
When did you last meet Suva?
-Around-- -No! It's been quite some time, sir.
It's been several months.
Mrs. Indira Gandhi was alive when we last met him. Right?
She was here for the election campaign.
We've not been in Rajasthan for the last eight months.
Yes. It's been eight months, sir.
Haven't seen our wives or had home-cooked food for eight months now.
Haven't been close to her. Haven't got any action.
-Does he look like Suva? -Oh, god!
Such brutality!
He was butchered.
They tortured him to death.
Did Suva have any enemies?
He was a loner. How could he have had any enemies, sir?
Did he make opium or deal in it?
Opium?
Opium, cocaine, drugs.
It's the first time I'm hearing that Suva used to peddle drugs.
No one advertises their drug business.
Drugs enter Munabao through the border. You know that, right?
We never knew that, sir.
Now you do.
This is how the drug smugglers butcher those who betray them.
It's not just Suva's murder, it's a warning for his three partners.
-Three… What do you mean? -Dhanna.
You keep quiet.
Where's Dhanna?
He's in Kolkata, sir. He'll come after four days.
Okay, you may leave.
-Inform us before you leave the town. -Sure.
And…
Don't tell anyone about Suva.
No…
Sir, I feel like they know nothing about this.
Hello there!
A man's reputation is tarnished
when a stranger meets his wife on the sly.
You've posed a threat to it twice.
Come upstairs. Get us some tea.
So tell me, bro.
What was so urgent
that you couldn't wait until I got back?
There's work in the city. I need trained men.
What kind of work?
I have some old doors, window frames, and idols to take there.
How many men do you need?
Five to six.
How much will you pay us?
Two thousand rupees for you, and a thousand each for them.
Motherfucker! Who will serve us the tea? Your father?
That's quite meager an amount!
Cover up!
Cover up!
You sell these ancient artifacts and earn millions.
But you want to pay us peanuts!
Not all villagers are dumb.
Some are like Panna Ram.
By the way, you don't need so many people to do your job.
The three of us are enough.
Pay 1,500 each for my friends, and 5,000 rupees to me.
Three thousand for my work and 2,000 for toying with my reputation.
Half as advance, now.
Find someone else if you can't.
Hope the antiques aren't stuffed with opium.
It's all right if they are, it'll just cost you more.
We have to leave tomorrow.
Just the two of us now. Dhanna will come after two days.
But if you wish, we can leave tomorrow.
Better still, today!
Plowing the fields around here is futile.
These lands are as barren as my bed.
Must wet our whistles elsewhere!
SUB INSPECTOR SUREKHA SINGH
These new-generation IPS officers!
Can't find their way out of a paper bag
and he wants to teach me my job!
Sleep now.
Five minutes.
You've been saying that for half an hour now.
Do you ever feel bad that I just remained an inspector?
Couldn't become SP or DSP.
No. Good that you didn't become one.
Politics at the upper levels isn't your cup of tea.
This is better.
You command respect here.
I get milk and vegetables for free.
Today, the plumber fixed the tap and didn't charge me a penny.
So I'm happy.
The ceiling won't collapse. Sleep off.
Let him go to hell!
There's no big deal!
Keep an eye on my wife! See you in a week.
We'll sit at the back and play cards. Come on.
Give me a hand.
Let's go, sir.
Hold tight.
Keep this bag flat.
Place the cards here.
-What? -Where's the pack of cards?
Look carefully.
His name is Suva.
Did he come to rob your house?
Sir, I was at the temple--
To light lamps, right?
You keep saying that!
Idiot! You lit so many lamps
that his pants are still on fire.
Jeeva! Bring him.
What's his name?
Shashi.
Come on, squat. Do it!
Bastard!
You can get intimate with girls but can't squat, huh?
Come on, sit. Keep your head down!
Tell me.
Did you go to light your lamps or douse his fire?
Sir, my in-laws will call off the wedding.
So shall I call it off?
I'll kill myself then.
It takes a lot of effort to commit suicide alone.
Do it together. It would be easier, and it'll make a good story too.
Sir…
Easy.
Look, Babita.
What you do in your personal life is up to you.
Just tell me who attacked your family.
-Sir, this… -Give it here.
This was stuck to the door.
"If you say anything to anyone,
you and your brothers will be killed like Babulal.
-Keep mum." -This scared you!
You should've burned it in your father's pyre.
Let's go, Bhure!
She's a coward.
She'll die too!
Sir…
There were six of them.
They took everything. All our things, even the trunk…
What trunk?
My father's trunk. He was to sell it for the wedding.
What was in the trunk?
Powder.
What powder?
The kind that's consumed.
Do you know any of them?
One of them is from his neighboring village.
Bring out the cards.
How much this time?
I've got enough.
This is the trump.
Hey, I won!
Again… deal?
-Distribute them. -Have we arrived?
Where are we?
Sir, what now?
Some of my stuff is up there.
We need to take those too.
You, come with me.
May I sit for a while?
Yes, sure.
Hey!
I got tired of honking.
Couldn't you hear it?
I've often seen this fort from the road
but never came up here.
No one comes here, actually.
Where's Kanwar?
He's resting inside.
That lazy fuck gets tired just by walking. Ah! Thank you!
Usually, Dhanna and I do all the heavy lifting.
Your Highness, are you asleep?
Bastard… You…
Motherfucker!
What are you doing?
Stop! Stop, motherfucker!
Why are you beating me?
If your information turns out to be wrong, I'll teach you a lesson.
I know him from childhood, sir. He was my teacher. Sisram Ahir.
Look there, sir! Those are his two jeeps!
Sir, there's a whole gang.
And backup? Oh! Who needs it? We can deal with it.
Stay alert! Motherfuckers!
Stay low.
Sir, they vanished.
That rifle is not there to scratch your ears!
Yes, sir.
Motherfucker!
Take over the steering wheel.
Get the horses.
Someone threw this in the front yard.
Read it.
"Inspector,
you've caused me huge losses. I'll burn you to death.
Your death will repay the capital. Your son's, the interest.
Whoever I lay my hands on first
will settle the debt."
Who is that?
Pack your bags.
Why?
You two leave for Ghanerao.
Go to my sister's house.
RJD 326. That's the number plate.
Panna said the room on the terrace is vacant.
I can stay there till Dhanna returns.
He fixed the rent at 200 rupees.
He asked me to give it to you.
He'd never let me have so much money.
Give it to him when he comes back.
He's taking the truck to Delhi.
He'll return in a while.
I don't want to stay here for free.
I'd feel awkward.
If you're uncomfortable, I'll go away.
No. He said you can stay here, right?
So you can.
Have some tea. I'll set up the room.
Sir!
Sir!
The motorcycle guy is ready to talk.
Go on, cry more!
The more you cry the less you will pee!
Fucker! Tell him what you told me.
-Is your name Nathu? -Yes, sir.
-How many camels? -Four.
-All the four are with the gang? -Yes.
Who killed Babulal?
Speak up!
-Who killed Babulal? -Hanif Khan killed him, sir.
He also told me to throw the chit in your house.
Which village is Hanif Khan from?
Speak up now!
He's from Pakistan, sir.
-Pakistan? -He was in the Pakistani army.
He gets all his weapons from there.
Hanif Khan sold opium from Pakistan earlier.
Babulal worked as his agent.
But he betrayed Hanif Khan, and started selling the drugs himself.
Hanif Khan got a whiff of this, and he killed Babulal.
But I'm innocent, sir…
You scoundrel!
Scoundrel!
Where's Hanif Khan? Where's he now?
He's hiding in the desert
waiting to kill you.
What are you going to do?
Panna!
Mister!
No…
Help! He's killing me!
Panna!
Motherfucker!
Sir…
What did I do to you, sir?
Please let me go.
Sir…
Whose picture is this?
He's not Hanif Khan's man?
Why was he killed?
-I don't know… -Motherfucker! Don't lie!
Don't lie!
We didn't kill him. No one from our gang killed him.
Only a monster can kill like this.
Kill me! Motherfucker! Just kill me!
Kill me in one go, you motherfucker!
Don't torture me like this.
Listen, sir…
Please, sir.
Please spare us. Let us go.
Take as much money as you want.
I'll give you all our money. Just leave us, please. I beg of you.
Bhure…
Why don't you quit this police job?
You cook delicious meat dishes. Open an eatery.
You'll lead a happier life and earn more money too.
All Makhan sells is tea and snacks, but his house… It's twice as big as ours.
He's from an upper caste, sir.
No one will come to eat meat dishes made by a lower caste man.
At least my caste gets hidden by this uniform.
You know what I'm feeling?
After ages, I'm finally enjoying this.
Opium, dacoits, Hanif Khan's threat…
For the first time, we are not just handling security for ministers
but are doing the job of real cops.
You're right.
I too am enjoying this.
I thrashed that rogue so hard, my hands turned numb.
This is called investigation!
But I can't figure out one thing.
Suva, who was hung from the tree…
Who killed him and why?
Sir, you told me yourself.
That it was a poster of an upcoming movie.
You also said
that it's Panna and Kanwar who can tell us the real story of that movie.
But somehow, I have a feeling
that this film is not about the main villain.
Who is it about then?
Maybe the good guy is behind all this.
Or maybe it's one of the supporting cast.
Or who knows?
It could be the heroine.
Dal baati for you today.
Shall I add butter?
I hope you like it.
Panna!
Panna?
Good evening.
Is Panna Ram home?
He has gone to Delhi for some work.
I had told him not to leave without informing us.
I don't know. He left all of a sudden.
Are you his wife?
May we come in?
When did he go to Delhi?
It's been two days.
When will he return?
In a week's time.
Sir.
Hello.
I've sent Panna Ram to Delhi to handle some work for me.
He's renting the room upstairs.
I will wash those…
No, let me.
Guests don't do chores.
Do you have a cigarette?
Smokers care two hoots about caste.
Come over.
What are you doing around here?
Sometimes Munabao, sometimes Rohiri.
You are seen everywhere.
I deal in antiques.
I buy from ancient villages and sell in Delhi.
Today, I'm in your district. Next month, somewhere else.
There is a bigger business. Ever tried that?
What's that?
Opium trade.
Smuggled from Pakistan.
Can be easily hidden in the antiques.
Do you know Hanif Khan?
No.
Have you seen him?
-He's Suva. -No.
Milk.
What happened to your face?
I accidentally walked into a wall.
Will Panna Ram certainly return in a week?
Is there a phone number?
If he was in one location, perhaps.
Let me see.
Do try.
Let's go.
And… Didn't catch your name.
What's your name?
Siddharth.
Siddharth.
Let's go, Makhan.
He ran off to Delhi while we were busy with the meat dish.
Sir.
Don't insult the food.
It is loved even by the Gods.
Come on. Stop.
Hey, Dhanna, hurry up.
Come on.
Get on… hurry up!
Sir.
Please have a bite before you leave.
Don't worry about the food.
Keep an eye on Siddharth.
Sure.
-Get off me! -Why'd you kick me off?
You are screwing me but thinking of Panna and Kanwar.
Are you insane?
Why would I think of them
when I am with you?
I lose my mind when I'm around you!
-Really? -Yes!
But you think of them immediately after fucking me.
What? Missing Panna already? Should I spread my legs again?
I can't match your appetite for sex
and Panna's for treachery. It's not right.
They left without me.
And you're still thinking about them! Fuck off!
My land…
Take my land! Take it all.
You can sell it.
You can sell it for about half a million.
Take the whole thing.
Take it.
Get the papers ready.
I will sign them.
I will sign it. Please let me go.
No! Do not! No!
Let me go! I will kill you!
Please…
I will be forever grateful to you. Let me go. Take my land…
I will be forever grateful to you.
Forgive me, brother!
Oh, Dhanna!
This is for you.
He's Dhanna. He's Gauri's husband.
Dhanna, he's Mr. Siddharth.
-He hired Panna, sent him to Delhi. -I see.
Greetings.
Why is he staying here?
Panna rented out the terrace room to him.
-Panna did? -Yes.
Sir. Wait.
Wait up.
When are Panna and Kanwar coming back?
They are waiting for you.
They said the job was for six people, but you three were enough.
So tell me when and I'll go there.
The truck left.
No problem, I can go by bus.
I'm heading that way. Need to send more stuff. Come with me?
How much rent is Panna charging you for the room?
Five hundred rupees.
So much! He screwed you over.
I would've charged you only 400.
The highway is that way. You're going the wrong way. Turn around.
That's where we need to pick up the stuff from.
But that way is the border. Turn around. Trust me, I am a local.
Where are you going? Stop! I haven't informed my family.
Slow down!
Are you a Pakistani? Stop!
Stop, you motherfucker!
Coming from the border
or beyond it?
Century-old artifacts lie buried in the desert.
I excavate them.
Are you allowed to?
I have permission from the Archaeological Survey of India.
Here.
Driving license?
"Siddharth Kumar."
-Is he back? -Who?
Panna Ram.
You were going to get us to talk on the phone.
It's difficult making long-distance calls from here.
Him leaving this place without informing us is illegal.
And you too.
Inform the police when going towards the border.
This area is dangerous. Anything can happen.
Hey…
-Should I hold him? -No. It's fine.
Keep him.
He'd pee the moment he's done fucking.
He wanted to pee. I went to clean up.
Dhanna vanished.
Didn't even bid me bye!
Am I a whore?
Are you a fool?
He's gone to do Siddharth's work.
He will be back soon.
He has given money to you.
Why did he hand it to you? Why didn't he give it to me?
Yes.
As if you'd let him go?
What do I do with the money?
Keep it safe.
Buy some jewelry and clothes.
And it's good he's gone to work. Right?
Come on! Let's dance.
Please stand up for a bit. I'll dust the bed.
Don't do this. I have kids.
I am innocent.
Please don't do this to me.
Help me, Lord! Don't do this!
Don't do this!
Don't do this! Fear the lord.
I'm infertile.
Sir.
Sir.
Sir.
Any leads?
-Found the kid's turban on the way. -I see.
A wild animal could've taken him.
No! A wild animal would've taken the sheep, not the kid.
This is the same kid who found Suva hanging, right?
Yes.
The villagers are angry.
They say the cops are sitting idle.
Sir.
Go on. I need a break.
I'll end up getting retired six months earlier because of this idiot.
Sir!
Did you find anything?
Sir, that fort…
Bhure!
Bhure!
Bhure!
Motherfucker!
Come on, drive!
I'm leaving tomorrow.
My work here is done.
Where to?
Going back.
I'll come with you.
Hello.
Hello.
What happened?
Those motherfuckers killed him.
They killed Bhure.
The DSP has called, sir.
Tell him to fuck off.
Sir.
Sir, I'm very worried. Something is wrong.
He didn't take any clothes or his wallet.
-Dhanna has never done this before. -You know Suva, right?
Panna told me he is Dhanna's and Kanwar's friend.
I can see it in your face.
You are hiding something.
Your husband might meet the same fate.
Just like this.
Tell me everything you know about Suva
or I won't be able to save your husband.
Dhanna and Suva bought some land some ten months ago.
They grew opium but didn't tell Panna and Kanwar.
I asked him not to. The fuckers didn't listen to me!
This is the house.
SUVA REGAR, 138 B MERIN HOUSE NEW DELHI, DELHI - 110034
It's not my fault, sir. I just wanted to steal some things.
Dhanna, Panna, and Kanwar forced me.
Suva!
Open the door, you motherfucker!
Here he is!
You took so long, motherfucker!
Keep your voices down, come on. Upstairs.
-Where do we go? -Upstairs.
What upstairs idiot?
Hope no one's home?
-Hey, tell me. -No one will be home for five hours.
-Come on. Slowly. -Take it easy! Hey!
Keep it down.
Open it!
Here.
-Grab her! -Don't let her go, motherfuckers!
Get her! Come on!
Hold her! You bitch! Pin her down.
-Suva, stop staring! Get some rope. -Get some rope.
-You bitch! -Let go!
Shut up or I will thrash you!
Quiet!
Sir, they both have left taking their belongings an hour ago.
The inspector is going towards the border.
Which route are you taking?
This will take us to the border.
Whose photos are these?
Who?
Why don't you ask yourself?
Come on!
Oh, god!
Are you all right? Get up.
What did you do, you monster?
Tell her where you got this from.
Tell her!
Tell her where you got it.
Speak up!
You bitch!
You bitch! Shut up!
Take this.
Take this!
You whore! Take this!
Take all this!
You wanted to fight me? You bitch.
Forgive me.
We had opium before going. Things got out of hand.
All that your family suffered…
I know about it.
Surrender.
The path of revenge is fraught with peril.
It won't let you live, but it won't let you die either.
It's a double-edged sword.
It's never a solution.
There's no respite.
Always punishing.
Revenge neither offers justice nor ends the hate.
The avenger always digs two graves.
One for the enemy, other for the self.
It continues
until he inevitably falls to his death.
[woman] On my way.
[man] This is Detective Wade Rollins with the Portland PD.
Leave your name and number, and I'll get back to you.
Detective, uh… [sniffles] This is Andrea Bowen again.
Sorry. Uh…
I know it's late, but could you call me back when you can?
I-- [shudders] I'd really appreciate it.
[shakily] I'm just really scared, and I just…
I feel like he's still watching me.
Detective?
[man] Andrea, this is how the world ends.
[sobbing] No.
[sobbing] No! -[tense, fast-paced music] -[yelling] No!
-[tense, fast-paced music] -[yelling] No! No, no, no! No!
Help!
No! No…
Help! Help! Somebody! No!
Help! Somebody! No! No! Help!
-[music continues over speakers] -[woman] Hi, sorry. I had a bottle of wine, but I drank it,
so I brought you this plant, which I'm now noticing is dead.
-I called you five times. -What's wrong?
Jenn, Brian's here.
I know, I'm sorry. It's just--
Originally, you weren't coming, and then Scott invited him,
and I had absolutely no idea. So…
Yeah, I could just… tell everyone you're not feeling well, you know?
I think I need a glass of wine.
Hey, Jenn!
Hey, Scotty.
Hey, I am so sorry.
Yes, yes, he is.
-You don't have to apologize. -He does.
She told me a week ago that you weren't coming.
-It's her fault. -Okay. Stop.
You don't know what's happening, so walk away.
-Okay, that's really cute. -I love you. [chuckles]
[woman] Oh, it's Dr. Meade!
[chuckling] Hi. Dr. Meade.
Hi.
This is Jenn. As in, "The Jenn."
-Yes. I'm "The Jenn," apparently. -[Meade] Ah!
-Collin Meade. Very nice to meet you. -[woman] He's magical. Changed my life.
I got the promotion, like, a month after working with you?
And this house. You should totally go see him.
What? Everyone needs therapy.
-That's what you say, right? -You know where the ice tongs are?
-It's by the ice bucket, Scott. -[Scott] They're not there.
Babe. Seriously, every time! I put them beside the ice thing.
It's not every time. [continues inaudibly]
Didn't know therapists could hang out with their clients.
I mean, I follow the rules 99% of the time.
Maybe 95?
It was nice meeting you.
-Cheers to your new house. -My new house!
So, Brian, how's Foghorn?
What's Foghorn?
-It's a stupid name, is what it is. -No, what is it?
Uh, the guys created a new software for some big audio engineer.
I just helped write some of the code.
What about you, Jennifer?
Oh, sorry. What?
Oh, no. I was just, uh--
What do you do?
I'm just-- Um, I'm sort of in between jobs at the moment.
She's just being modest. Jenny is actually a killer software engineer.
-Impressive. -[Jenn] Mm-hmm.
-So, you two ever worked together? -Brian!
Um… Is there sesame in that? [gasps] Oh my God! Brian, I'm so sorry.
[Brian] It's okay. It's okay.
Wow, that would've sucked if you died in our new house, dude.
You know what? I think I'm gonna leave this right here.
Just in case. [chuckles]
-[mouthing] You okay? -Yeah, I'm good.
-Jennifer. -Hm. Yes?
I'm headed out, but, uh, I wanted to leave you this.
-In case you're interested. -Okay.
Good night.
You too.
Uber?
Yeah. "Viola will be here in nine minutes."
Thanks for saving my life.
Don't mention it.
Good night, Jenny.
Good night.
Jenny?
Yeah?
I have tried really hard not to bother you, but…
I think about you all the time, and I just--
I miss you.
I didn't ask you to stay away because you bother me.
Yeah. I know--
Then don't say things like that.
When you say things like that, you make me sound like the bad guy,
and I'm not the bad guy. I'm--
You're not the bad guy. I'm not saying you are.
I'm just-- Oh God, what am I saying? I don't know what I'm saying.
Can I give you a ride home?
-I don't think that's a good id-- -[Brian] It's just a ride, Jenny.
[woman] You guys had sex?
-Do you plan on getting back together? -No.
I'm stupid. Oh God, I'm the most stupid.
Oh my gosh, you're not. You're not stupid. You're just-- You're--
-You're unhappy. -Yeah, everyone's unhappy.
No. I'm happy. Scott's happy.
And for the most part, I hate to say this to you,
but Brian is happy.
What am I supposed to say to that?
[clicks tongue] I think you should see Dr. Meade.
-Who's Dr. Meade? -My therapist.
-Gina, I'll never do that. -You met him. He's tall, handsome.
-No. -Come on.
Hear me out, okay? You're isolating. You're unemployed.
Don't pretend like you're not.
And you slept with your ex-fiancé last night.
-Your life is a vortex of crap right now. -This is so much fun.
Can you just go for me, please?
-Ugh, fine. Once. -Great!
I made you an appointment for Friday.
You should've seen me when I started with him.
Oh, sorry?
I pull my hair.
OCD.
Whatever you're here for, Dr. Meade will fix it.
Yeah.
He's waiting for you.
Oh, okay. Um, yeah.
Wow, this is cozy.
Jennifer.
[chuckles] Just feeding the little guy.
You know that having fish reduces stress and lowers blood pressure?
[Jenn] No, I didn't.
At least that's what I've heard. Who knows if it's true.
But I do find them calming.
I'm so glad you decided to come in.
And here I am!
Please.
[Jenn] I don't feel motivated to do anything.
Or, like, I should probably stop drinking. I should probably exercise more.
I should probably get eight hours of sleep at night.
Jennifer, um,
bad habits come from deeper issues.
There's always a root cause.
What might that be for you?
I don't know?
Was that a question?
Yes?
Tell me about you and Brian.
He's nice. He's sweet, he's funny, he's smart. It's Brian. I don't know.
[exhales] Okay. Fine. Um…
We met in college.
We lived together. We worked together. It was like a whole thing.
I had a miscarriage.
Actually, I was six months along, so it was a stillbirth.
His name was Daniel.
I got to spend 33 minutes with him.
Brian and I were engaged, and, uh,
you know, we just couldn't really figure it out after that. So…
Do you have anything after this?
No.
Have you ever tried hypnotherapy?
[chuckles] No. No, I have not.
Why the judgment?
I'm just not a giving-away-control person,
so it's a pass.
Sure. But here's the wonderful thing about hypnotherapy. All right?
Only you can control your subconscious.
-[Jenn sighs] -So, you're in control the whole time.
And it's an excellent tool for people who have suffered…
trauma.
Worst case scenario, it'll stop you from further destroying your poor fingers.
[sighs] I don't know.
I had a mentor,
and his name was, uh, Dr. Xavier Sullivan.
He was a brilliant mind. He would say,
"Prosaic methods are reserved for the unimaginative."
"One in search of lasting results dares to open the mind."
-[Meade] Jennifer? -[Jenn exhales]
What do you want?
Just wanna be happy again, you know?
Then let me help you.
I want you to concentrate on the light.
[Meade] Feel the weight of your body as it melts into the couch,
muscle by muscle.
Starting at the toes,
the arches of the feet.
[Meade] Calves. Thighs.
All the way up,
until you arrive at the top of your head.
Now,
I want you to find yourself
in a beautiful forest.
That was an hour?
It felt like three minutes.
How do you feel?
[sighs] I don't know. I don't really remember anything.
How'd I do?
I think you might be more open to suggestibility
than you imagined.
[Jenn] That was bizarre.
They called me right after I left. I start in two weeks.
Are you gonna do some yoga with me, or you're just gonna lie there?
This is Shavasana. It is yoga.
How many sessions did you have with Dr. Meade?
I don't know. Maybe, um, once a week for about three months now.
I've asked him to do hypnosis twice.
It's not fair. I wanna conquer all of my fears.
It's a compliment. You've already conquered all your fears.
Hi, have you seen me and spiders? Didn't think so.
I'm really proud of you.
[whispers] You're perfect.
Jennifer?
-Hi. -[chuckling] Hi.
-You look fantastic as ever. -Oh, thanks. You too.
Haven't seen you in a couple of weeks. You're not, uh… you're not avoiding me?
Oh, no. I've been meaning to schedule. It's just I've been busy--
-Sure. -Oh…
I got the job.
-What? Really? -Yeah, I did.
-I had no doubt. -You didn't think I could do it?
No. I never doubted you.
May I buy you a celebratory coffee?
Yeah, okay.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
I did yoga with Gina, and I meditated last night.
Amazing.
It was three minutes, and I thought about my dead plants, but I did it.
-Progress. Not perfection. -You can't say that.
You're one of those people that wakes up at 5:00 a.m.
-and you're perfect at everything. -Hardly.
And one of those who hangs out with his clients but is very private.
All right.
I'll play.
I'm 46. Only child. [clicks tongue]
Uh, I was married once to the love of my life, Amy.
We were happy, but she died.
I'm so sorry.
What do they say? "Wanna make God laugh, tell him your plans."
But, Jennifer, the important thing to remember
is that being a victim is a choice,
and we can let our hardships define us, consume us, or we can accept
consume us, or we can accept
the extraordinary abilities that we have in this life
to create the outcome we choose.
-For ourselves. May I? -Mm.
[chuckling] Eyelash.
-[smooth jazz continues over speakers] -Thank you.
All right, well, enough about me. Um…
So, last we spoke, you were struggling a bit with Brian.
How's it going there?
I don't know. I have been avoiding him.
When you see Brian, uh,
is it hard for you?
Yeah.
Have you considered telling him this?
And if you did?
He may be hurt because we still care about each other a lot.
Let me suggest something, and you can take it or leave it,
but I think you'd be wise to take it. [chuckles]
Okay.
Invite Brian to your place for dinner tonight.
-No. -[Meade] Why not?
I can think of infinite reasons why not.
Trust me. You'll be on your turf. You can cook a good meal.
Tell him you got some matters you need to discuss.
I think it'd be very good for you.
But not easy. I mean, I'm not saying that. But-- But good.
'Cause, Jennifer,
you don't have to be a victim anymore.
[Brian] Hey, it's Brian. I got your message.
Yeah, uh, I'll be there.
Let me know if you want me to bring anything. See you soon.
Hello?
Hey, hey, hey! [sniffles]
Where's your pen?
Where's your--
[Gina] Hey.
It was an accident, Jenn.
I mean, I almost killed him at our housewarming party.
You're the one who caught it.
I can't remember anything.
-You're probably just in shock. -No, I'm not in shock.
I'm serious. I--
I remember being at the store.
And then I'm at home sitting at the table.
Come on. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna take you home.
[Meade] How's Brian?
Sorry?
Brian. How is he?
He's the same.
-[Meade] How long has it been now? -Eight days.
Do you remember anything else from that night?
Is there any way that I could be responsible
for what happened that night?
[Meade] Why do you ask?
Because I can't stop thinking about it.
The way it felt,
and the missing time.
It's like what we do here.
[inhales] Do you remember what I told you the first time we discussed hypnosis?
That only you have the power, control over your subconscious.
-Yeah, but-- -[Meade] Jennifer, listen to me.
We all have these wounds,
and every time we let the world run us, those wounds fester.
But that's a choice based on some preconceived notion
that the world can even run us in the first place.
It's ego.
Ego derived from fear.
You follow?
So, the work we're doing is designed to eliminate that fear,
but the moment you start to doubt our work,
fear wins.
Is that what you want?
To let fear win?
No.
So you need to trust me…
and keep doing the work.
Hello?
[Meade] Jennifer,
carry the fire.
[newswoman] This is a terrible turn of events,
as the family is reeling after losing their daughter,
and they still have no information from police. [newsman] …and in Portland, there's an investigation
[newsman] …and in Portland, there's an investigation into the death of their daughter.
She'd recently taken out a restraining order on her psychiatrist.
Of course, it's been a game-changer to the entire case
as the police are now looking towards finding out further information as what…
[newsman 2] The study into crimes while under hypnosis
is new to the state criminal court.
There are currently board psychiatrists…
[sighs] I don't know, Jenn. It's just-- I get why you'd be concerned.
I mean, it's not exactly comforting news, but I just-- I don't see it.
No, look. It says here in the article,
"Bowen told her family she was experiencing missing time."
That is what happened to me. It was after I had lunch with Dr. Meade,
where he suggested I had Brian over for dinner.
-It just feels like a big leap. -Look at the background check.
You ran a background check?
Yes. Look, the only address listed is his office.
There's no private residence, employers, or unpaid parking tickets.
The man is basically a ghost until six months ago
when someone takes out a restraining order. This is his patient,
and he is torturing her. Stalking.
Psychological abuse, emotional abuse.
Maybe she was crazy.
This woman was afraid for her life,
and then three days after she files a restraining order,
she's dead.
She had a heart attack.
What if there is something else going on?
-What if he did something to her? -Okay. This is where you lose me.
Therapists use hypnotherapy to help their patients quit smoking.
Not to hack into their brains and stop their heart.
-This is not a thing. -Yes, it-- Look, I thought that too.
In Sweden, a group of teenagers are hypnotized to deal drugs,
and they experienced blackouts.
In Germany, Zebediah Cantor is hypnotized to rob banks, and he has missing time--
Okay, I get it.
And this is from that night with Brian.
He called me, Gina.
Right before I blacked out.
Dr. Meade?
I remember everything now.
I did it on purpose, Gina.
It-- But it wasn't me. It was, it was--
But I did do it.
And then I just sat there and watched.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't get help.
I didn't even move until I came out of it.
I'm not crazy. [exhales]
So, what do we do?
Hey.
Thank you so much for meeting with us, detective, on such short notice.
-We really appreciate it. -What can I do for you?
We wanted to ask you some questions about a woman named Andrea Bowen.
Six months ago, she filed a restraining order against Collin Meade.
I know the case. What's your question?
Her family said that she died of a heart attack,
but then they wanted a broader investigation.
Did that investigation ever happen?
Why are you asking?
Because Dr. Meade is our therapist.
Something strange is happening.
Strange how?
I've been having
weird dreams.
But they don't feel like dreams.
You've been practicing hypnosis with Dr. Meade, Miss Thompson?
Collin Meade was brought in for questioning
a week after Bowen's death.
Got us nowhere.
I wanted to keep digging.
I got a warrant, obtained his patient records.
Didn't matter. Got shut down that day.
Told I couldn't even finish going through what we had.
Why?
Meade was also practicing hypnosis with Andrea.
It's funny. Cops using old witnesses sometimes.
Try and get them to remember things they may have seen. [clicks tongue]
If it works,
it becomes evidence in court,
but if you're a victim, claiming someone used hypnosis with ill intent, that kinda thing, they'll laugh you out of the room.
with ill intent, that kinda thing, they'll laugh you out of the room.
You don't think she died of a heart attack?
Oh my God!
[detective] And then there's this.
Incoming call came from a blocked number.
-Her behavior changed when she answered. -That happened to me.
What is she doing?
You ever heard of "quiescence"?
No.
It's the body's reaction to extreme fear.
The body enters paralysis, heart rate increases,
breathing intensifies.
But if it goes on too long, you die.
Maybe, technically, she died of a heart attack,
but whatever she was seeing in the elevator is what caused it.
So, what do I think?
I think you should find yourselves a new therapist.
I'll talk to you later, okay?
Yeah.
Jenn?
He hypnotized me.
What?
When?
This week.
We talked about you, I--
It's just-- You were so worried that something happened with Brian,
and then he just--
He said he was wrong before, and then he thought that it might help me.
It's okay, it's okay.
We'll do what Det. Rollins said. We'll stay away.
We'll figure this out, okay?
Hey, Dr. Meade, it's Jennifer Thompson. We just saw each other,
but I was wondering if you had any last-minute appointments available.
Call me back when you can. Bye.
Jennifer. Please, come in.
-I was thrilled to get your call. -Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in.
Was there something in particular you wanted to talk about?
No. Not-- Nothing really, actually. It's just, um,
a general anxiety.
Brian's not awake yet, and so that's hard.
Yeah.
I thought just a bit of hypnosis might help?
Of course.
Okay.
[Wade] Lillian Dorsey.
Date of death, 11/27/2019.
-[phone line trilling] -[Wade] I'm looking for Adrienne Dorsey.
-[phone line trilling] -[Wade] I'm looking for Adrienne Dorsey. This is Detective Wade Rollins with the Portland PD.
I was hoping I could ask you some questions regarding your sister.
Date of death, June 15, 2018. Hypnosis. Andrea Bowen. Hypnosis.
[Meade on recording] Was there something in particular you wanted to talk about?
[Jenn] I thought just a bit of hypnosis might help?
[Meade] Of course.
[Meade] Jennifer?
-[Jenn] Yes? -[Meade] Are you under?
-[Jenn] Yes. -[Meade] Good.
I'm going to ask you some questions, and you're gonna tell me the truth.
Why did you really come see me today?
[Jenn] To record you.
[Meade] Are you recording me now?
[Jenn] Yes.
-[Meade] And why are you recording me? -[menacing music]
[Jenn] Because I want to hear what happens during our sessions.
-[Meade] Do you not trust me? -[Jenn] No.
Why not?
[Jenn] Because I know about Andrea Bowen.
[Meade] Is this why you were at the police station this morning?
[Jenn] Yes.
[Meade] You were with Gina.
I assume she knows everything you know.
-[Jenn] Yes. -[Meade] Yes.
Thank you for being honest, my love.
-[Scott] Dude, what quarter is it? -[Gina] Tell him to not--
No, they are not up by seven, bro! [laughs]
-I'm serious. Hang up. -I gotta go before she kills me.
-See? -No, it's Jenn!
Tell him I told him wassup! Keep me informed. Yeah, okay, peace.
Girl, I gotta call you back. I have buyers calling any minute.
-Gina. Gina, where are you? -I'm just in the car with Scott.
-[Scott] Hey, Jenny. -Where are you?
We just left the house.
Turn around and go back to the house.
-I'm coming to you. -What? Why?
Could you go back to the house? You need to go back, listen to me.
Could you go back to the house? You need to go back, listen to me. -Gina, get-- -I'm sorry, you're cutting out. I can't--
-Gina, get-- -I'm sorry, you're cutting out. I can't--
This is them. I'll call you back.
No, Gina! He knows we were at the police station. He knows!
Gina?
Fucking shit!
This is Gina.
[Meade] Gina, it's Dr. Meade.
Sorry to bother you, but do you have a moment to chat?
I'm just in the car with Scott.
[Meade] Even better. Gina, this is how the world ends. -[phone beeps] -[whoosh]
What was that?
[quietly] Get it off of me.
What?
Scott.
-[Scott] Gina. -[Gina shudders]
-Get what off? -Get it off. Please!
-Get what off? -Get it off. Please! What? There's nothing there. Get what off?
-Get it off of me! Please! -Gina, relax. Gina!
[screaming] Get it off!
Gina, stop!
Get it off! Get it off! -[truck horn blares] -[Scott] No!
-[truck horn blares] -[Scott] No!
Detective Rollins. What a pleasant surprise.
Care for a scotch?
Gina Kaleman died in a car accident tonight.
[Meade] What?
-Her husband too. -You're kidding me.
Oh my God.
How long was she a patient?
[Meade] I don't know. Maybe…
…eight months?
-[Wade] What were you treating her for? -She came to me with some, uh…
…generalized anxiety initially.
You ever perform hypnosis on Gina?
Yes. Uh, we performed our first session last week.
Started small, you know?
-Explored her common phobia. -Claustrophobia?
Arachnophobia.
The last claustrophobic patient I dealt with was, uh…
Well, it was Andrea Bowen, actually.
You know what I always loved as a kid?
Puzzles.
I'm sure it has something to do with why I became a detective.
Putting the pieces together, finding the patterns.
That was always the key.
Patterns.
I looked through some of your patient files today.
The ones we obtained after Andrea's death.
I got to chat with family members, and I noticed something.
A pattern.
You don't use hypnotherapy on all of your patients.
Just a few, actually.
Andrea Bowen.
Lillian Dorsey.
Mona Szohr.
They share some physical characteristics,
and they also all happen to be dead.
You ever noticed that?
That pattern?
Gina Kaleman doesn't match your MO.
I think you had something else in mind when it came to her.
Is there something specific you wanted to talk about tonight, Wade?
Because if not, I should be going. It's getting late.
[Wade] It's Detective Rollins.
-Thanks for the booze. -[Meade] Oh, Wade.
Hypnotherapy works wonders for insomnia.
You wanna try it? I'll give you a free session.
Thought you only took female patients.
I'll make an exception.
My phone died, or I would have called.
Um, I heard about your friend.
I just thought I could catch him saying something or doing something.
He was at the station. He's been following us.
He's smart.
Always a step ahead.
There's a reason he never hypnotized Gina until you started asking questions.
He knew you would go to her. She got in the way.
You can't blame yourself, Jenn.
And just why me?
Well, I don't know.
But not long after Andrea started asking questions, she was dead.
He's not done with you yet, or you would be too.
I got his prints. I'm gonna run 'em, see if we're missing anything.
I should know more tomorrow.
For now,
lay low.
[Jenn] Detective.
Thank you.
Try and get some rest.
I'll call you in the morning.
Did you forget something? Hello, Jennifer.
Jennifer, stop!
You don't need to be afraid of me. I just wanna talk.
What did I do to you to make you not trust me?
[firmly] Think about it.
I invited you in. I listened.
Really, you should be thanking me.
I asked you what you wanted, and I'm working so hard to give you that.
And Brian and Gina were just gonna get in the way of your dreams.
And now Rollins.
Don't worry. He'll be taken care of.
Everything I'm doing is for you, Jennifer.
And I know there's been a lot of build-up and anticipation, but…
build-up and anticipation, but… that's just the romantic in me.
-It's almost over. -[Jenn shudders]
[quietly] You're so close.
I'll see you soon, okay?
Oh, Jennifer… -Relax. -[Jenn gasps]
[quietly] Pick up. Pick up.
[Wade] This is Detective Wade Rollins--
Come on, come on.
[woman on TV] When the police ran his prints, they discovered his real identity. He had changed his name.
they discovered his real identity. He had changed his name.
[man on TV] And who was he, really?
[woman] A killer. Wanted for murder in three states.
-[menacing music] -[TV dialogue continues]
[male narrator] Tonight, on The Crime Files.
In the fall of 2014,
seventeen-year-old Victoria Wilson disappeared from her suburban home
seventeen-year-old Victoria Wilson disappeared from her suburban home in Metuchen, New Jersey,
leaving her parents and four younger siblings
heartbroken and terrified.
Three days later, her body was found in a forest 300 miles from home.
So, what happened to Victoria Wilson?
Billy Adler came home from school
to find his mom dead at the dining room table,
shot in the head.
The police ruled it a suicide. But Billy knew his mom would nev--
I can't tell them I think Meade was involved.
They don't know I've been digging into this.
I'm so sorry, Rollins.
You read 'em?
And?
And I have an idea.
When Gina and I came to see you, you said something about
how police sometimes use hypnosis. [Wade] Hm.
What did you mean?
A drive-by shooter speeds away from the scene.
An eyewitness saw the car but can't remember the license plate.
[clears throat] Well, maybe they do remember it.
Just not consciously.
So, we send them to a hypnotist who tries to help them recall.
And that will hold up as evidence?
-Sometimes. -What if we did that?
What if you sent me to whoever you use for that sort of thing?
And they put me under
and try to make me recall my sessions with Meade.
-It still may not be enough. -You just said--
I said, "Sometimes."
Do you know how hard it is to charge someone with murder
and get them convicted?
But he all but confessed to me that he's responsible for Brian and Gina.
-You recorded it? -He said he was coming after--
Jenn.
With everything else we have, the other victims, the pattern…
He's planning something. I know he is.
I don't know what, but the way he was talking last night--
Please.
I just wanna try.
Please wake up.
[Meade] You were with Gina.
I assume she knows everything you know.
-[Jenn] Yes. -[Meade] Yes.
Well, thank you for being honest, my love.
I'll take all of your concerns into consideration.
And then he cuts it short.
Jenn.
How much do you really know about hypnotherapy?
[sniffles] Not much.
Well, it's an incredibly powerful tool.
When handled with care and integrity,
it can be a force for good.
But in the wrong hands, hypnosis can be dangerous.
What are you feeling?
[exhales deeply] I am having, um, some trust issues with your profession right now.
some trust issues with your profession right now.
Jenn, I understand that this may not be worth much,
but you can trust me.
I'm one of the good ones.
And I'm only gonna have a look around.
Just see what the subconscious retained from those sessions with Dr. Meade.
[doctor] Focus on the sound of the metronome,
keeping time.
And as you feel the weight of your body
sinking into the couch,
I want you to let everything go.
Let the world around you slow down.
[doctor] Jenn, can you hear me?
[Jenn] Yes.
[doctor] Now, I want you to tell me everything you remember
from your sessions with Dr. Collin Meade.
Jenn?
Wake up, Jenn.
Jennifer!
I need you to listen to the sound of my voice
and come back to this room right now!
[Meade] My mentor was a psychiatrist.
Dr. Xavier Sullivan.
-[doctor] Wake up, Jennifer! -[Jenn screams]
What happened?
Dr. Graham, what happened?
I've never seen anything like that.
He must have planted some sort of
fail-safe or--
What's a fail-safe?
In case anybody ever tried to do what we're doing.
And I have no way of knowing
how many sustained post-hypnotic suggestions he placed.
And these can be triggered at any given moment.
I remember something.
There was a house.
What's today's date?
It's the sixth.
-I have to go. -No, wait.
There's one more thing I could try.
Look, I can't remove all of his suggestions,
but maybe I could plant something of my own.
Like a counter trigger?
Exactly.
I swear to God, this is the last time I'm doing this.
[Jenn] Rollins, it didn't work.
But I found out that Meade has a mentor named Xavier Sullivan.
[Wade] Okay. [Jenn] Have you heard of "Project MKUltra"?
[Wade] Yeah, it was a CIA project in the '60s.
[Jenn] Well, Sullivan is a hypnotist. And the CIA had recruited him
to use hypnosis to plant false memories in people.
I'm on my way to see him.
[Wade] No, Jenn, that's not a good idea.
[Jenn] He might know something about Meade that can help us.
-[Wade] Just wait for me. -[Jenn] We don't have time.
[Wade] Jenn. Jenn!
[Jenn] Mr. Sullivan?
Hello?
Anybody home?
Mr. Sullivan?
[Jenn] Oh my God.
[Meade] It's uncanny, isn't it?
My wife was such a beautiful woman,
but then so are you, Jennifer.
-I don't understand. -Xavier was my father.
He left me this place when he died.
Jennifer. -No, just wait. -Sleep.
-No, just wait. -Sleep.
It's Rollins.
[man] Hey, Rollins. I ran the prints from that spoon.
They belonged to a man named Julian Sullivan.
Info's in your inbox.
[Jenn's voice] You reached Jenn Thompson. Leave a message.
Son of a bitch!
-[Wade] Jenn, where are you? -Rollins, it was Meade.
-His real name is Sullivan. -Jenn, tell me where you are.
He brought me back to his office.
-[Wade] But where is he? -Door is locked. I don't know!
I'm sending units now. Hey, taxi! [groans]
Move! Drive!
How are you feeling?
Jennifer, take a seat.
You know…
I'll never forget that first time I saw you.
-Give me something. -[man] We've entered the building.
[Meade] You look like her,
walk like her,
you even smell like her.
There's nothing quite like a woman's scent.
The moment you catch it, it's just…
[quietly] Just like that.
Memories.
Come on.
[agent] On the floor. Approaching suite.
There were a few others,
and they seemed right at first,
but ultimately,
they just weren't meant to be.
We're at the door.
What are you waiting for? Get in!
[Meade] I mean, I see why now, though.
They were close.
But you're perfect.
Move, move!
And now I have you all to myself.
[squad leader] On my count.
[Meade] Jennifer.
You can wake up now.
[shakily] Where am I?
You're home.
-Sir, there's no one here. -What do you mean there's no one there?
The office is empty, sir.
He wanted her to call me.
Detective Wade Rollins to dispatch.
I need a residential address to one Xavier Sullivan.
-[dispatch] Copy that. -[tires screech]
[gulps] I can't move.
I know.
I'm not thrilled you started biting your nails again.
We'll have to work on that.
[quietly] I know this room.
I was hoping you'd recognize it.
They weren't dreams.
Oh, they were your memories with her.
Some of my favorites.
You put them in my head
because you're trying to replace her.
The power of hypnosis.
The memory, planted in the mind,
given the right amount of care and attention,
will blossom into a whole new reality.
A whole new life.
Make someone believe they're somewhere they're not or,
you know, paralyze from head to toe,
all with a simple suggestion.
My mentor taught me at--
-Oh my gosh, a very young age. -Your father?
Father, mentor. Interchangeable for a young boy. [chuckles]
You're insane.
[whispers] I am not insane.
[quietly] We want the same thing.
We share wounds.
Your loss of Brian and your son Daniel.
My loss of Amy
and the life I thought we'd have together.
We will be that for each other.
Go like this.
-And now, for the grand finale. -[sniffles]
[quietly] Don't move.
[Meade] You don't happen to know today's date, do you?
Now you know why I waited.
Our anniversary.
I told you,
I'm a romantic. [laughs]
[softly] And there she is.
My beautiful bride.
You're perfect.
-[Jenn gasps] No. -Jennifer, don't let go.
[screams] Rollins!
[Wade] Jenn!
Rollins! Rollins, I'm in here.
-Where is he? -He went out the back.
-I'm trapped. You have to help me. -[Wade] The door is locked.
Jenn, listen to me.
I have to go find him. You're gonna be okay.
What? No, no, no! Rollins, no!
Please don't go! You can't go! Please don't go!
[panting] Okay. Come on. Just focus. Focus.
I'm okay. I'm okay. [panting]
[Jenn] Rollins!
[Wade] Jenn, the gun!
[Meade] Jennifer, sleep!
[Wade] Jenn? Jenn?
It's Rollins. Wake up, Jenn.
-[Jenn gasps] -That's it, wake up. That's it. No.
-You're okay. -No.
-Where is he? Where is he? -He's gone.
-It's over. You're okay. -[Jenn panting]
I called in for backup. They'll be here shortly.
You're okay.
You're… You're a good shot.
-Oh, sorry. -It's okay.
-Here. -Thank you.
[groans] Here. Here.
You're gonna be fine.
I promise, my love.
[doctor] Jenn.
In the recording you played me,
Dr. Meade called you "my love."
[Meade] Thank you for being honest, my love.
If you are ever under a post-hypnotic suggestion by Dr. Collin Meade, and he refers to you as "my love,"
by Dr. Collin Meade, and he refers to you as "my love,"
you will ignore
every single trigger he put into your head.
And you will see the world around you
for what it truly is.
Meade?
-I'm not your love. -[groans]
-[Jenn] No! -No, no, no.
[whispering] Rollins.
Oh my God! Oh God.
Hey, hey! Wake up. Please wake up.
-Come on. -[weakly] Ankle.
What?
Jennifer!
[Wade] Ankle.
[Meade] Come here!
Hey. No, no, no! Hey, hey, hey! Hi.
Right here. Look at me, look at me. Look at me, look at me. Yes.
Hi, hi! You're okay, you're okay.
-[weakly] You shot me. -[Jenn] I'm sorry.
Stay-- Yeah. Stay with me. Hi. You're okay. You're gonna be okay.
-[whispering] Stay with me, okay? -[sirens wailing]
[Jenn] I can hear them. I hear sirens. They are coming. It's okay.
You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.
I think it's great. We present it to the team at Monday's meeting.
But I'm a huge fan.
Uh-huh. Great work, Tiff.
Yeah, I'll see you then.
I'm definitely moving. [chuckles]
You'll like the new place. You don't have to. I understand.
I know you're very particular about your things.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I left.
I'm sorry I didn't share my grief with you.
I'm sorry that I thought losing Daniel
was harder for me than it was for you.
And I know it's not my fault what happened to him.
No matter how much I wanna blame myself.
But it is my fault what happened to us.
And for that, I'm really, truly sorry.
The doctors say your tests are promising.
That's really good news.
And when you wake up, I'll be sitting right here.
-My condolences on your promotion. -[chuckles]
I'm regretting it already.
I left you alone, but I did wanna say thank you
for everything.
I wasn't sure when I'd see you again, but…
I figured you'd come around eventually.
A token of my appreciation.
To be part of the elite?
The elite, 200 years ago, meant being royalty,
or aristocracy.
Twenty years ago, it meant being loaded.
Nowadays, titles and cash don't always stop you from being a loser.
Nowadays, power is fame.
Once you've tasted it,
you'll do anything not to lose it.
Even die.

Hey! Hi, guys!
It's great. I'm finally in Biarritz.
Balzac!

-Balzac! -It'll be okay. I'll put him down.
Never do that again.
He's fine, don't worry.

You're a good boy, aren't you?
We're with Tristan Badiola, French surf champion.
Can we have a little kiss?
Sure.
Thanks, girls. Bye.
-Hey. Do you need me to drop you off? -No, it's fine, thanks.
-My name is Tristan. And you are? -Balzac!
I could show you around Biarritz.
Heard of La Belloteka? Great place to get in the mood.
I don't need to.
I'll be upfront. I'm with someone and I'm faithful.
Damn.
How old are you? You sound just like my grandma.
I can translate into your language.
Being far from my bae got me trippin',
and here comes this lame-ass snob with his ride trying to spin me a line.
Epic fail, though.
Nice try. But no one talks like that.
Except for the principal of my school, actually.
Patrick Riva?
-Yeah. How did you know? -He's my uncle.
Dang.
You're Charlotte's cousin?
You're nothing like her. Okay.
You visiting her?
No.
I'm doing my senior year at Victor Hugo.
Okay.
We'll see each other then.
-So where is your guy? -Pierre?
Pierre…
Pierre is staying in Paris.
-He's studying to get into medical school. -Okay.
You know what they say about long-distance?
And what they say about teeth whitening?
It wears down your enamel over time. Be careful.
Don't worry, I won't rain on your parade.
But can we at least be friends on Insta, or will that piss off your guy?
You do know what Instagram is, don't you?
I've had better things to do than post my whole life online.
Such as?
Dealing with my dad's depression and my mom's death.
That's that, then.
World champion of jerks, Tristan Badiola. I'm sorry.
Don't worry. You couldn't have known.

-You can follow me if you want. -Okay.
Okay, bye.
-What are you doing? -A gift.
-Welcome to Biarritz. -Thank you, but no. Keep it.
You live in Biarritz now. What are you saying?
-Surfing isn't my thing. -Okay, I get it.
You think surfing is for airheads
and you'd have way more fun reading novels and sipping Earl Grey tea?
-Yes. -Challenge accepted.
-Tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. on Central Beach? -Not in a million years.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Balzac.
FYI, I've never had my teeth whitened. See you tomorrow.
-Still no. -Got something better to do?
Hey, coz! Follow me on Instagram.
It's tiny!
It's too tight. I really do prefer my book and Earl Grey.
-So? -I can't lie.
Surfing is very cool.
And what about the view?
Not bad.
The Rocher de la Vierge is the emblem of Biarritz.
Eiffel built the bridge and Napoleon decided to drill the rock.
Penetrate the impenetrable. Couldn't they have left poor Mary alone?
Are you a feminist?
I try to be.
-That looks like an engagement ring. -It's meant to.
I'm marrying Pierre in a year.
You're serious?
I don't see what's so funny.
Two words: but why?
Because I want to. Because I believe in marriage.
Hooking up with lots of guys isn't important.
Can you stop laughing?
Girl, if you want to live like it's the 18th century, no problem.
At 17, you can't control much, but you can choose what to do with your body.
And I decided my body would belong to one man only.
-You don't believe in true love? -I've never thought about it.
Unlike Pierre… Shit, Pierre!
I had a FaceTime date.
-Someone's in trouble. -It might be nothing.
It's never nothing.
Just keep your phone on you like everyone else.
Instead of living in the '90s. That's dumb, too.

An early edition?
No way.
I can't accept this.
It's better off with you than rotting on my shelf.
What's this?
I don't know, what is it? Weird.
"Dear Madame De Riva, I'm having a small gathering at my place on the 31st."
"There'll be some pals from school if you want to stop by."
"I can introduce you."
"Sincerely, Tristan de Badiola."
"Your Biarritz buddy."
I could've texted you, but I wasn't sure you'd know how that works. So I went for…
this version.
Can I bring my cousin?
POOL PARTY AT TRISTAN'S DON'T YOU KNOW?
-A little get-together, huh? -Well, yeah, it's cool, right?
Wow! Look who left the studio to stop by!
What's up? Glad you made it. How's the album coming along?
We recorded the track featuring Clara. Already a hit.
-Really? -You're Clara?
Do you think he'll graduate this year, or…
Third time's a charm, bro!
Hi.
Oscar.
Oscar?
From The Voice?
Yeah.
Shall we go?
Hey, two days until school starts.
I didn't tell you, bro. Crazy news this year.
Riva is bringing his daughter back to school.
She's spent 10 years with nuns. That's a long time.
And I heard she's dumb.
Six. I spent six years with the nuns, not ten.
And I'm not dumb.
I'm going to see the bathing suits.
Could you be more stupid? It's unbelievable. Honestly, it's…
Wait, that's your cousin?
Is it true her mom ran away with a guru to live in a nudist colony in the States?
Yes!
You hang out with this guy? Really?
Well, no…
Bro, thanks for throwing such a dope end-of-summer party!
Boys, make some noise!
-Only one year left. -Aren't they your friends?
Honey,
look at me. I was only invited because I'm the best DJ in the Basque Country.
You brought Proust to a party?
I love it! Where do you come from?
-Paris. -I love Paris.
Fuck the sea. Fuck surfing.
Okay, look up there. Don't make it obvious.
Is that…
LITTLE SOPHIE 1 & 2 LITTLE SOPHIE 3
Little Sophie? Chill. She goes to Hugo.
No way! She was my idol!
At Victor Hugo, all the girls want to be Vanessa Merteuil,
and all the boys want to be in Vanessa Merteuil.
But she and Tristan are a super-solid star couple. Impossible to break.
-Wait, they're together? -You didn't know?
-No. -They're considered royalty here.
They've known each other since they were six, honey.
Both verified and inseparable. 10 million followers between them.
Sorry. What do you mean by "verified"?
Oh, wow!
Where and when do you think we are?
-Today, at Tristan's. Why? -Not at all.
-Yes. -No.
We are in 1782 in Versailles.
At the top of the pyramid, you have the king and queen.
The verified King Badiola and Queen Merteuil.
Below you have the dukes and duchesses,
influencers like Naya and Ariel, who post what the royals command them to.
Then you have the knights, who are supposed to enforce the law.
You have the king and queen's jesters.
Their job is to bring in more followers.
Then there are the servants, and right at the bottom,
you have the peasants.
And that hot guy?
Ben will hit on you online and ghost you in real life.
Because you don't look like Thor, the Viking.
And you?
-Where are you in the system? -Me…
I'm the merchant.
At your service.
Thanks.
What's a merchant?
He's in with everyone at every level so he's way too valuable to kill off.
You're ten times hotter than Thor.
Ten times.
Careful, a post with Charlotte Riva is 10,000 followers lost.
-A drop in the ocean. -The instrument of my revenge.
You can look at yourself as you say that?
-Not over losing the 2020 challenge? -I loved that car.
You shouldn't have bet it then. I told you Riva was untouchable.
Not even Vanessa Merteuil can fuck a director.
Do you remember my 2019 challenge?
Go on, remind me.
I sucked off a monk.
Riva was this close to unzipping his fly at the June fair.
Then his Chacha called him and he went soft.
So it's her fault you won my Range Rover.
You shouldn't talk so much.
Like movie bad guys who get caught after explaining what we already knew.
I won the bet, you lost your car, and it has nothing to do with her.
You know that.
Would you fuck Charlotte and make her the school whore?
No.
Not cool. Don't you want to play anymore? Are you in love?
-Yes. With you, my Little Sophie. -Shut up.
Why don't we fuck already?
It's not in the contract.
I know.
Go on, just once.
Wait…
You want me to fuck you, just once?
Charlotte.
No way.
Getting her hooked wouldn't be a challenge.
It's almost insulting. And besides, I have better things to do.
Who is she?
A Parisian. She's going to Hugo this year.
And you invited her? You wanna fuck her in the garage?
FYI, she's totally faithful, she's engaged and believes in true love,
and has a shit-ton of values, so no, I wasn't going to fuck her in the garage.
But I will make her my personal challenge.
I'll help her forget that bullshit about true love, marriage, fidelity…
If I'm good, I'll mess with her head so much she'll be begging me for it.
I want to play.
Sleep with her, then ditch her.
-If you fail, I get the beach house. Deal? -No, I'm doing this alone.
I mean, you already gave me your car, how can you bet on that?
-I'll add a clause to the contract. -Be more precise, please.
Up to 3 hours of foreplay, oral included and an unlimited fuck plan, front or back.
Precise enough?
Yes, that's precise.
I have to use the restroom. I hope there's paper.
Little Sophie!
You're my absolute idol! I'd love to be like you!
-Can I hug you? -No.
I'm so happy.
I hope we can be best of pals now we're in the same class.
You smell nice.
-Bro, have you seen Célène? -She left. Here.
"Dear Mr. Badiola, my fiancé's train just got in."
"Can't wait to see him. Look after Charlotte for me."
"Thanks again for the invite."
The offer expires in 30 seconds.
Accepted.
Cool. You have two months.
New year, new scandal.
Ben!
Catch!
-Yeah! -Oh, that's enough!
Okay, who's this now?
Hey, nice purse. Do they make those for men too, or…
He's right, man. I might be gay, but you're a queen.
Bye, losers.
Hey guys, all good?
I can't tell if you're a nice guy who hangs with jerks,
or a jerk who pretends to be a nice guy.
-We're the jerks? -Yeah.
Wait. What's the problem? I don't get it.
Come on, guys, let's go! She's not into us.
Here's the deal.
We're going to start with a badass project in Philosophy class this year.
So, who can tell me, from an ethical point of view,
about The Princess of Montpensier?
-Julius? -No.
-Julius? -No. No? No one?
No? No one?
I gotta say, you got me trippin'.
-Why does he talk like that? -Oh yes, I almost forgot.
Your smartphones, in here.
-What? -Just kidding. LOL.
But they will be going in here.
Yes, for the whole year. Sorry, not sorry.
-Come on, hurry up. -How do we do it then?
Old-school style.
THE PRINCESS OF MONTPENSIER DE LA FAYETTE
Miss Riva. What's that sheet of paper?
It's mine. It's just notes.
-On The Princess of Montpensier. -Notes on The Princess of Montpensier?
Sick!
Go on then, read it aloud for the benefit of the whole class.
Go on, stand up.
Basically, I wrote that The Princess of Montpensier
is the tragic fate of a girl who's torn between her duty and her passions,
thus revealing the risks that our passions represent
in a world bound by rules of propriety.
Thus condemning any woman who would have sacrificed her virtue.
Is she for real?
It's exactly that.
Well done, Miss Riva.
And read the actual book. Don't just watch the Tavernier movie.
Your ring is beautiful. Where did you buy it?
-It was a gift. -An engagement gift.
-Engagement? -You're engaged?
If I were engaged at 17, it would mean: one, I'm pregnant.
Two, I fucked the whole world at 12.
Or three, my cousin's case. One man, her whole life, by choice.
The niece of the principal of Victor Hugo is engaged at 17!
To her first-ever boyfriend!
#2021guaranteenofake
Congratulations on the engagement.
-Are you surviving your first day? -No.
Come on, it could be worse.
Look, a surfing accident.
-Is he dead? -Dead?
No, not at all. He got hit by a wave and needs an operation in the States.
The school started a GoFundMe.
How much have you raised?
Thirty-seven euros.
Plenty of people are loaded here, but they won't lift a finger.
Poor Lucas.
Wow, 1,000 bucks! Thanks, man!
No problem, man.
It's funny. Good deeds are often a way to clear your name
-or clear your conscience. -Or just a way to give.
95% of people who donate feel more pleasure than those who receive.
Especially when the donations aren't anonymous. Right?
The other 5% actually do care and are not just playing woke.
Right?
That's why…
My first act as rep will be to raise the money needed
for Lucas Rodriguez's surgery.
-And add fries to the cafeteria! -Yeah!
Check yourselves, fam! Anyway, Mr. Badiola, that's sick!
And thanks to Célène who offered to help raise the funds.
Clever, bro. Cool.
Dear members of the council, the idea is to organize a paid show
with Vanessa Merteuil.
At the Casino Theater during fall break.
It's sweet, but still a bit amateurish.
It's a 1,000-seat theater. What will you put on?
-The Princess of Montpensier. -Well, that's a bit…
As musical theater.
Hip-hop.
Who'll direct it?
-It… -My dad.
-Her dad. -Christophe Riva.
-He's won three Tonys. -Stop.
He's your dad?
Yes.
He's hot. I mean, he's good. Brilliant. An excellent director. I…
We're too good!
What?
-Nothing. -Go on, tell me.
It's just you surprise me, and not many people surprise me.
Madame De Riva, care to go to the movies?
-To celebrate-- -I'm FaceTiming Pierre.
Hey! Say that again, I'll whoop your ass.
No, but…
-Franck! What're you doing? -Having fun. What's it to you?
Get his crutches.
-You okay? -Yeah, thanks.
Sorry, I had to step in.
Can I drop you off?
-I can make the movie. -Sure?
Go have fun.
And my cut?
Well done, coz!
You're brilliant.
Célène? Patrick sent me a text saying, "Holy guacamole!"
"Célène killed it! She's somethin' else." What does it mean?
-The council and theater approved it. -Approved it?
Dad?
I told them you'd direct it.
Charlotte, can I have a word with my daughter, please?
Of course.
Thank you.
-Why'd you tell them that? -Dad, it's everything you love.
Musical theater, classic text.
Célène.
Losing your mother meant I lost the love of my life and my muse.
Really, I can't direct anymore.
Because at every creative stage, I feel this emptiness in her wake.
It's just one show.
For me. They would love you.
But it's fine.
I'll find another director.
-Another director? -Yes.
-Who? -I have some leads.
-Leads? -Yes.
-Like who? -Just, people!
Okay.
Okay.
Hypothetically speaking, if I were to direct your musical,
it would be just one night, right?
Yes.
How would we do rehearsals?
It would be best for me to come after school.
I'll see if the theater is free for auditions and rehearsals, lighting…
I know a good lighting tech nearby. I'll call him up to see if he's free.
Hi, Tristan! How are you?
-You brought Charlotte? -Yes.
-Is that a problem? -Well, yes.
I thought we were friends.
Sorry.
What? We're friends out at the movies.
Your cousin isn't my friend. No offense, Charlotte.
None taken, Tristan.
Seriously, how old are you?
-How old am I? -Yes.
-Sorry. -Are you serious?
You're the kid who brings a chaperone to a date.
There. Happy now?
Absolutely.
Célène!
-Get out the way! -Chill!
Célène!
Célène!
It was a joke, chill out.
Am I a joke to you, then?
I'm engaged! You have a girlfriend!
And for the record, don't ever tell a woman to chill out!
I didn't think.
I was warned.
-I never should've come. -Wait.
-Warned about what? By who? -Someone with my best interests at heart.
Where are you?
Hi.
-I've got some weed-- -Put your ganja away.
-Okay, something stronger. -No, it's fine.
What do you want?
Nothing. We just want to help you.
Yeah.
If the videos reach Riva, you'll be kicked out of Victor Hugo.
But that's not the worst thing. How old are you, Tao?
Over 18?
He's over 18. Yeah.
Zero-tolerance policy for adults dealing to minors.
-Can you see yourself in jail? -What the hell is this?
Hey, man, chill.
We're all friends here.
I'll take care of it for you. But I need a favor from you.
I want everything from Célène's phone on this phone.
Install spyware on it.
I'll find the fucker wrecking my image and beat his ass. You have two days.
It's up to you.
What are you doing?
-I have to tell Pierre. -No!
He kissed you, so what? Chill.
Hey, coz! It was so good, I loved the film.
It was so romantic. Where did you go?
I thought you'd gone to pee and you never came back. But…
What are you doing?
Hey, Ta--
The massage is really good.
A very effective detox.
Be right back.
You okay?
-You don't look great. -I'm fine, don't worry.
Have you heard the good news?
We're together.
Riva put us in the same group.
It's cool we get to write the final act.
What was it like to win The Voice?
I didn't, I lost in the final round.
Cool! Not that you lost, but cool that you made it to the end.
-Do you like karaoke? -What?
Miss Riva…
Can I have a word with you?
All good, gang?
-Yes, sir! -You gotta slay, fam!
Yeah, we slay hard.
The Princess of Montpensier Has a hidden fountain
I think it'd be so dope if you auditioned for one of the roles.
One you dig, of course!
Me? In a musical?
Splashes, splashes, splashes
With two years of singing class you'll kill it, Chacha.
Singing class?
Mr. Riva, can Charlotte help me learn my singing part?
I'll help her with her acting.
Yes, very good, Miss Merteuil.
Sounds dope, Chacha. I mean… Miss Riva. Good evening. Okay, goodbye.
I never studied singing. Don't tell my dad.
-Are we friends or not? -Yes.
Friends help each other. I have a friend who can help you.
He owes me.
It's okay, thank me later.
Vanessa? Can I call you V, like in Gossip Girl?
No.
Célène, wait!
I'm going surfing after class, but come to my house later to work on the play.
I'll email you a proposal for Act 5 by tomorrow night. Bye.
I'm going to love my new beach house.
So?
I saved the password so you can connect.
All gone.
Oops.
My phone's dead.
In case you wanted to warn your new friend.
Wow! The Little Sophie set! It's beautiful!
-Can I take a photo? -No.
Okay.
Vanessa told me you need singing lessons.
Yes.
Go on then, show me what you can do.
-Well, I wrote something. -Okay.
-Okay. -I'll follow you.
Yeah.
Okay, wait two seconds.
-We could start with a warm-up, okay? -Okay.
-Shall I stand here? -Yes.
I'll leave you to it.
-Thanks, V. -No, still not V.
Yes.
Yeah, sorry.
-That tickles. -I know.
I can't.
Yo! Let's head out?
I'm not in the mood.
Wait, Zoé! I want to train with you!
-I have an audition for you. -Is it a lead role?
-No, but-- -I'm not interested.
Where are we on Little Sophie 4? Did they read my script?
Darling, the producers aren't too into it…
REUNITED WITH MY FIANCÉ #BIARRITZ
TRISTAN?! WATCH OUT, HE SEEMS LIKE A DICK!!
That bitch hides her game well.
Coz, Pierre called you three times.
The surf lesson's getting long. Beware of Tristan.
He has a beautiful face, but his eyes don't lie. He's so twisted.
He does these sketchy bets to ruin people's lives.
-I'm up for fucking Charlotte. -Okay.
-What changed your mind? -A personal vendetta.
Love it. I'll set it all up for you.
Tomorrow night, cosplay party.
I love cosplay!
-What are we wearing? -What I tell you to.
Little Sophie 4 is a no-go?
Get up.
Turn around.
Your ass got bigger.
Hey, Chacha. The cosplay party is tomorrow night.
You and your cousin are guests of honor.
I'll send my chauffeur at five sharp. Get dolled up.
Yes!
We've been invited to the party of the century at Little Sophie's castle
for the whole weekend, and Dad said yes! What are you doing this weekend?
Well…
Cosplay!
Come on, coz!
You're coming.
But the official version is "girly slumber party".
Babe! Have you got any plans?
Just a girly slumber party at Little Sophie's place.
Awesome. Sounds fun.
I told you, coz! It's a castle!
Cosplay! She lives here all alone? Every day?
When she was 15 she realized her parents were taking all her money.
She filed for emancipation and sent them away to Saint-Tropez.
On a boat. It's so funny because they get seasick. So great.
-Hey! Hi, Oscar from The Voice. -Just Oscar.
-Save a dance for me? -I'd love to.
See you later.
How are you, Chacha?
-Sorry, I was just… -Do you like Oscar?
Yes.
When you like a boy but have zero sexual experience, do you…
Yes. The answer is yes. Have yourself a pancake.
You don't know the pancake rule?
The first is bad. Just like sex.
-I've never had pan-- -I'll explain.
When you like a boy, ignore him. Fuck someone you don't care about.
So you can get experience without the pressure.
It's a little tight.
-What if I stop breathing? -Good idea.
It's Ben.
WHO ARE YOU GOING AS? -Is this I'm-gay-but-you're-a-queen Ben? -He's not the same on social media.
Wouldn't be a bad idea to make a move in real life tonight, huh?
So, you…
Yeah, go on, mock me! Call me a chicken, sure!
-You are one. -Girl!
If I step out of my comfort zone tonight, will you do the same?
-I don't know what you're talking about. -Oh yeah?
Which book have you brought?
Swann's Way?
Hallelujah.
Ta-da.
-Okay! -Cosplay!
Do you like it, then?
I have a thing to…
-What are you dressed as? -A slutty nun.
Jesus, these harmonies are terrible. It's getting more and more tense.
It's great. You have to let it build up.
You look good, man.
-So, you like Kurt Cobain? -Yeah.
Hey, Tao!
Have you got something for me?
Wait.
For all I care, Vanessa can share those videos.
You can try to take me down.
But leave Célène alone. She's a nice girl.
Thanks for the candy.
So, I'll send you the contract as soon as it's ready.
You're late.
Here.
Thanks. Here.
Thanks.
Why are you in such a good mood?
Because I'm serving Charlotte a cream pie tonight?
You're disgusting.
I love it.
Let's do this.
I've had enough!
What was that?
What was it?
-I forgot about her. -What? Who?
What day is it?
Don't worry, I got rid of the videos. Why did you do that for me?
Every game has its limits. Here.
Are you having fun?
Yeah!
Want the lowdown on something extra exclusive?
Yeah!
I'm making my comeback in Little Sophie 4,
so tonight let's party harder than ever!
Girl, you look great! Shit's hot!
What are you dressed as?
As Madame de Sevigné.
Who?
No, you're Lady Fuckit.
You're living it up!
The first Riva to go from peasant to duchess!
LITERATURE ALWAYS ANTICIPATES LIFE #O.WILDE
-It's our song! -Let's do it!
Dude.
Step aside.
Okay.
Pancakes?
Let's go!
Oh yeah, film me.
What are you doing?
Meow! Teach me how to fuck like a goddess!
No, stop.
Rule number one, no manslaughter by strangling.
Okay.
Rule number two, we wrap the pancake.
No, I'll do that.
It's part of my training.
There we are!
Don't move. I'll be right back.
"Push condom to edge of packaging before ripping opposite side open."
-"See figure two…" -Rule number three, stop talking.
"Pinch the teat between your thumb and index finger to push out any air."
"See figure three…"
Fuck.
Fuck, I want you.
-If you cheat on me, I'll kill you. -Okay.
I'm ready.
Tristan?
Are you asleep?
I'm hungry. I could go for a hot dog.
A mermaid!
Sorry!
-Forgive me, Sister, for I have sinned. -Me too.
I'm hungry.
Me too.
Am I fat?
You're perfect, like a painting.
For a moment, everything around me seemed unreal.
With lightning speed,
this impossible signature danced about my bed,
the fireplace,
the four walls.
I saw everything sway, as if I'd fallen from a horse, and I wondered
if there wasn't an existence different from the one I knew,
in contradiction of it, but the true one,
which, being suddenly shown to me, filled me with that hesitation
which sculptors, in representing the Last Judgment,
have given to the walking dead waiting at the gates of the next world.
Pancakes?
Here.
About last night…
-Did you like it? Did you have fun? -No.
Rule number four, don't sleep with an unconscious guy.
Hey, coz! Help yourself, I made coffee.
Getting on?
It's not a trap.
Thanks for Chacha.
And good luck with Célène, now you've fucked her cousin.
You'll thank me later.
-Have you ever heard of the laminak? -You believe in fairies?
They're not just fairies.
Laminak are river spirits, and according to Basque mythology,
they live in these caves.
Legend has it that they can choose to help a human
achieve their goals as quickly as possible.
-I come here before every competition. -What do they look like?
The laminak?
A female mortal. Very beautiful.
Bronze skin…
Amazing hair.
I'll have to bring Pierre here.
He'd love it.
I imagine that… you and Vanessa have had some nice times here.
Yeah.
Actually, no.
I've never brought anyone here.
Will it hurt?
Wait, are you…
You're not…
Yes.
I thought my wedding night would be the perfect first time.
It's late.
Long way home.
Célène?
Wait.
Stop!
I thought I would surprise you!
And this helmet? What the hell are you doing on this guy's motorbike?
You hate motorbikes!
-Célène. Is there a problem? -What does he…
Célène, can you explain who this biker is, who acts like…
Wait.
Dude, you're not Tristan Badiola, are you?
You gave her a surf lesson?
Is that it?
Pierre, this is Tristan, a friend.
And Pierre,
my fiancé.
Nice to meet you, man.
Can I talk to my fiancée alone, please?
Man?
You have feelings for him?
Seriously, Célène.
Why did you say "yes" to me?
So, the slutty nun?
All night.
She'll never bother you again. Non-stop. Every position. It was magic.
So, logically, you'd better grant me your graces now,
as I took Charlotte off your hands.
Does a tenor get applause just for clearing his throat?
Where are these lines from?
I have a great knowledge of cinema.
And the Parisian?
Didn't go all the way?
I was affected or something.
Affected?
You mean you couldn't get it up?
I get it up whenever I want.
Clearly.
I'll make up for it.
Can't wait to see that.
I declare the auditions for The Princess of Montpensier open.
-Good luck, Vaness. -I don't need luck.
Just my talent.
Just to be clear, this audition is just a formality for me.
Prince or servant, give me all the roles, even the princess, that could be fun.
Know the one about the penguin that breathes through its ass?
He sits down and dies.
Before my body fails me And I die in the stalemate
I want to get the lead out To my destiny I say
Oscar in the kitchen Prince Charming straight outta Disney
I'm here to get you crunk
Quiksilver logo on my apparel Give me your hand, drink from the barrel
I am the future of old-school rap Don't worry about what race I am
Bombs going off in my head My heart aches with what she said
Yes, bitch, I took home the trophy ESPN wants to know about me
Time to take off the masks Can't believe I'm Vanessa's man
What you see on TV ain't even the real me In the caves I wasn't ready…
Leave a message and I'll call you back, I promise. Bye.
It's Tristan. You've been ghosting me for ten days
We have to talk. There. I left you a message.
Call me back. You promised. Talk soon, Madame de Whocares.
PERIL HAS ITS CHARMS #VOLTAIRE
Hello?
Stop it, Oscar!
Listen, coz, if my dad asks, I'm still at rehearsal.
-Why are you short of breath? -Oscar!
-Am I really your first? -Yes.
I mean, I fucked a dozen girls at the convent. We were going insane!
-Seriously? -Yes.
You don't fit into any of the boxes. You make me laugh.
No one makes me laugh.
Hey, I decided to stop hooking up with other people because
I figured you and I could be something serious.
What I'm asking is, are we an exclusive item?
Yeah.
We have an hour until my mom shows.
-I'm telling her I have a girlfriend. -Actually--
Come in.
Looking for this?
Whoever's worse off gets the last spoonful.
Go.
-Pierre and me are over. -Ouch!
Ouch, but at least you had a guy and a marriage proposal.
I've never had a guy,
I've never had a girl,
and now I've got both, and I can't choose.
I've become my mother!
I think fear of commitment is
hereditary.
Here.
IT WAS A ONE-TIME THING, MAN! YOU'RE WACKO!
MAYBE I'M WACKO BUT AT LEAST I KNOW WHO I AM
AND I'M NOT AFRAID TO SHOW IT
Let me introduce you to our Count of Chabannes!
Thank you, Tao.
Now on to the rest of the roles…
The role of Henri de Guise, the wooer who breaks the princess's heart,
goes to Tristan Badiola.
The Duke of Anjou will be played by Ben Arcadi.
Well played!
Oscar will be the Prince of Montpensier,
Julius, the Count's servant,
and the role of queen will be played by Vanessa Merteuil.
What are you doing?
Shit.
Only two scenes.
Do you think Vanessa Merteuil will play a minor role in an amateur play?
It's a great part, we end up together.
You're an actress, right? When did you last play a role?
Who'd make a better princess than Little Sophie?
The role of the princess will be played by Charlotte Riva.
Well done, Chacha, you're perfect for it.
So proud of my daughter. Look, she's made a new friend.
Yeah.
Sir, for the costumes, we'll be in tights, right?
Here it is, enjoy yourselves.
We have three weeks to put on a five-act play,
so get to work.
I swear.
We were rehearsing…
Mr. Badiola. Célène.
I'm not interested. Your Act 5 is straight-up bogus.
Yes, it's well-written, but please!
You're in chill mode, bro! This is the real deal, it needs to be dope!
The break-up is the big scene.
To be honest, I'm not comfortable with 18th-century dialogue.
Is there a way we could update it, and--
No. There's no "way." Spoiled brat.
You have 36 hours to hit me with something fresh.
Something to make Lucas proud.
Go!
-Listen, about the caves… -Let's just forget it.
Nothing happened.
Why are you in costume?
My dad doesn't take half-measures. Charlotte's understudy.
-Does he know we've only sold 50 tickets? -No.
Lady Fuckit is getting a lot of followers.
You follow me?
Everyone does.

-Hi. -Hi.
How's my good boy?
Balzac!
Balzac!
Why's there an empty frame?
My mom's saving it for my world championship gold medal.
What's going on?
Why aren't you at practice?
Mom, this is Célène Riva, a classmate.
-The doggo's name is Balzac. -Hi.
We have work to do, it's…
It's fine. Set the alarm for 4:00 a.m. instead of 5:00.
You've lost some followers.
Things okay with Vanessa?
Célène Riva…
-Are you the director's daughter? -Yes.
-What's your Insta? -Lady Fuckit.
Pretty name. Is it from Brittany?
250,000 followers in one month? Your mom must be so proud.
What? What is it?
-Célène lost her mom two years ago. -She died?
Excuse me, it's Quiksilver. Sorry.
Here.
Yes, hello? No, don't worry…
-Shall we work at my place tomorrow? -Don't worry, I have a better idea.
So?
It's cool. But I don't see a desk where we can work.
I was planning on working in here.
I gotta catch a few waves, but make yourself at home.
What are you doing? There are too many waves!
Célène, stop!
No!
Célène!
Célène!
You need to get warm.
Sorry.
It's the best way to raise your temperature.
I know you didn't want to sleep with me.
I fell in love the moment I saw you.
I realized that in the caves.
When we started to…
You were so beautiful.
So lost.
I couldn't do something you'd regret given the circumstances.
But… the circumstances have changed.
Pierre and I are over.
Vanessa and I aren't a real couple, it's a front.
It feels good to say it aloud.
-And you've never-- -No.
We've never slept together.
But I almost slept with your cousin Charlotte.
Is that a deal-breaker?
Yes.
Maybe three months ago.
But now…
I'm Lady Fuckit, right?
Prove the pancake rule wrong.

What you peeping over there? Sounds pretty dope.
What is it?
I'm just…
What is it…
-What a whore! -What a bitch.
-Miss Riva! -What?
Well, we are in deep shit. Patrick, what did you do to Charlotte?
What did I do? I'm looking for her too, to kill her!
But she bolted!
The post wasn't an attack on you. And stop crying, it'll ruin your skin.
Hey, bro!
Do you know where Oscar is?
Oscar's disappeared too?
Charlotte's not at home and won't pick up.
-Have you tried her iPhone? -iPhone? She has an iPhone?
I found Oscar.
We're screwed.
Patrick, get me a coffee, an egg yolk, and two aspirins.
Tao, you replace Oscar in the opening and play piano for Ben.
-What? -I don't have the score. Improvise.
Célène, you'll play Charlotte's part.
-But I can't act. -You'll be fine.
-Charlotte can sing. I can't sing. -I see. You're right, let's cancel.
I'll get the cash and make the announcement.
Poor Lucas.
Go and get ready.
Move it.
Faster. Move it.
-About your daughter, I-- -Shut it.
-It's madness, I'm promised to the prince. -Not madness. Love.
-You won't betray me? -Never.
Henri, you're my love, but the prince is my reason.
Reason always prevails, doesn't it?
Your feelings for Henri de Guise are too bold, Madame. You must marry the prince.
If you break off the union, you dishonor your father.
Mr. De Guise, let's flee!
My obligations, my duty, my virtue
are nothing compared to the sincere love that unites us.
Say bye-bye to your happy ending
You shouldn't have defied me, darling
War is an art, I win every time
No use in crying You destroyed your purity
Every liaison is a dangerous one Dangerous
There's no such thing as happy love Happy
Every liaison is a dangerous one Dangerous
There's no such thing as happy love
-We need to talk. -I agree.
Well done.
You fucked her.
Now ditch her.
You have 30 minutes.
Tick-tock, tick-tock--
-I'm out. -What do you mean?
I lost. You won, my beach house in Guéthary is yours.
You told Célène we weren't a real couple.
Yes.
Now what?
Tell the world we're over?
Yes.
And your career?
I'm dropping everything. I'm sick of it.
You want war?
If I go down, you go down with me.
Re-read the contract. You have dirt on me and I have dirt on you.
You sure you still have it?
Who showed you how to install spyware, again?
I, however, do still have it.
-Go and spread it then, I don't care. -Not on you.
It's dirt on Lady Fuckit.
And it's enough to ruin her life.
Take it, I have copies.
You're sick.
Ditch her, and make it hurt.
The stars
Bring lovers together
Witnesses to their hope
Lonely souls wanting to be mates
Beneath the stars tonight
I'll make history
I give you back your dice
Give me love's true kiss
Because you…
You lift me up
Give me your lips, I'll give you my heart My star, my soul mate
Because you… You lift…
Stop the music.
My angel…
we can never see each other again, let alone be together.
It's not my fault.
What are you doing?
It's over. I've had enough.
Why won't you look at me?
Let go of me.
I don't love you.
At first, I did love you.
But with all your principles,
your values, your virtue,
you were a pain in the ass.
I've had enough.
-It's not my fault. -Not your fault?
Is there another?
Many others.
But one in particular. And it's because of her, it's for her
that I'm ending this now.
-It's not my fault. -Stop saying that!
What does that mean?
Actually, you're right.
It's my fault.
I was so stupid.
Maybe it's not too late to marry your perfect guy.
You forgot him, but maybe he's still waiting.
You're tearing me apart.
-I'm understanding who I really am. -I know who you really are.
You're just a jerk pretending to be a decent guy.
There's never a good time to dump someone.
Right here, right now, is just as good as any other time.
Why are you doing this?
He enjoys it, Madame de Montpensier.
It was a bet.
Bravo!
Thank you.
Well done to the students of Victor Hugo High School!
Bravo!
Let's enjoy our new contract.
Get off me, dammit.
I'll pass.
You disgust me.
You're totally fake.
-You feel nothing. -I do.
You don't understand women.
Obviously not.
But I know you'd need a game as an excuse to fuck me.
I'd never let you fuck me.
And I just won my personal challenge.
You'd never fallen in love, and now that you have,
you sabotaged your own great love story.
And for nothing.
POSTING
You're a psycho!
You're completely sick.
You're crazy!
Your fans, your pretty face…
What will be left in 10 years when you're a Botox junkie?
And your fans. How do you think they'll react
when they find out sweet Little Sophie is 100% fake?
Fuck my fans.
They can go fuck themselves. Hear me?
Bravo!
Bravo!
Hi, my loves.
I've always been there for you, but now I need you.
My world is falling apart.
Tristan cheated on me with Lady Fuckit.
My supposedly faithful, engaged friend.
Can you believe it?
SEND TO #THE ENTIRE SCHOOL
Oh my God!
I told you you talked too much. This one's on you. You fucking joke.
Fuck my fans.
They can go fuck themselves. Hear me?
Little girls, moms, poor people, losers, perverts
that have nothing better to do than follow me online.
Don't you realize social media is the bane of my goddamn existence?
I was the queen of the big screen at 10 years old!
I was this close to getting it back. Little Sophie 4, my comeback,
but I got fucked.
The bastards cast a 10-year-old. They don't care about me.
So you see,
my shitty fans who I hate more than anything are all I have left.
How far would you go to make a name for yourself?
To be part of the elite?
The elite, 200 years ago, meant being royalty,
or aristocracy.
Twenty years ago, it meant being loaded.
Today, titles and cash don't always stop you from being a loser.
Fuck!
Nowadays, power is fame.
Once you've tasted it,
you'll do anything not to lose it.
Even die.
Célène!
Célène!
What were you trying to do?
Why did you come?
I said I wouldn't miss this for the world.
I said "yes" because
my mother approved of you.
She adored you.
Being with you was…
a way to stay connected to her. You know?
Sorry. I'm sorry.
Maybe proposing when I did was a little…
hasty.
I wanted to take your mind off things.
You asked me to marry you
out of pity?
No, out of love.
But our love is more platonic, isn't it?
Vanessa and I were never together.
It was a ploy to make ourselves more famous, to get more followers.
We used to do challenges.
And Célène was our challenge for this year.
To fuck her and ditch her like the rest.
Except that I…
For the first time in my life, I fell in love.
And Célène…
What I did on stage
was to protect you.
It didn't work.
I'll always love you.
Truly.
That doesn't matter now.
You can ruin another's life through malice or weakness.
Tristan Badiola wasn't simply acting out of malice, and…
I forgive Vanessa Merteuil's weakness.
Don't attack her online. Don't break her.
We do crazy things for love or to be loved in return.
The number of followers doesn't matter. In the end, there's no glory without love.
The point isn't to find someone who makes you shine,
but who shows you who you really are.
Sometimes it's several people.
In love, we don't choose who we are, who we love.
Coz, you're the purest and the most wholesome person I know. TEAM LADY FUCKIT
Anyone who doesn't realize that, well, then they don't deserve you.
I love you, Charlotte.
I'm sorry.
If you screw up along the way,
who cares?
My mom used to say,
"The world is forgiving when you love truly."
LOVE YOU LADY FUCKIT
"The world is forgiving when you love truly"?
Could you ever really forgive me?
Challenge accepted.
You make me want to be a nice guy.
Not just a jerk pretending to be a nice guy.
I thought about it…
And yes, I do believe in true love.
I don't.
What?
Just kidding.
My sister,
Oscar,
Charlotte,
do the three of you agree to join together for life?
-Yes. -Yes.
Yes.
By the power vested in me by beapriestessonline.com,
I now pronounce you married.
You may make out.
Guys, there's a new king on social media.
I won't forget you, but I'm going to focus on rap.

-Yes! -Yes!
Solomon. Solomon!
[in isiNdebele] Where are you going, gents?
And what do you have in the bag?
It's just some luggage.
[bailiff, in English] All rise.
Be seated.
[prosecutor] Your Lordship, the state hereby charges the accused,
Solomon Kalushi Mahlangu,
a 21-year-old male of South African birth,
residing at 2445 Block C2, Mamelodi, Pretoria,
with two counts of murder,
two counts of attempted murder,
engaging in public violence,
and violence against property.
[in isiNdebele] Young man,
the state charges you with two counts of murder,
two counts of attempted murder,
engaging in public violence
and violence against property.
[prosecutor] And lastly, but most importantly,
the act of acting together.
The act of acting together and in common purpose
in the interests of another, namely Mondy Motloung, not present here,
to perform these acts.
Thank you, my lord.
I take it you've discussed the charges with your client, Mr. Mailer?
Yes, we have, Your Lordship.
And how does he plead?
To the two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder,
we plead not guilty.
To the other counts...
...we plead not guilty.
[judge] The trial date is set for 13th of February.
Transfer the accused to the Fort Prison in Johannesburg
until the completion of the trial.
[bailiff] All rise.
[Solomon narrating] This is my family. My mother, Martha, and my brother Lucas,
a prison warder, and sometimes my father.
They always wanted the best for me
and prepared me to become a man,
a responsibility I would appreciate in-depth
during my rite of passage in the Eastern Transvaal,
when we were forcefully removed from our land and thrust into poverty.
We left my father buried in a barren scrap of land.
Together, we get by, and help each other where we can.
We were enslaved by poverty.
And my education was to be my family's liberation.
[in Afrikaans] Uh... it was the 6th of April, ma'am... 1652.
[in Sesotho] Dube, are you still taking a dump?
[in isiNdebele] Fuck, Mahlangu, get out of here!
[Solomon narrating] Miles Davis once said,
"Jazz is the big brother of revolution. Revolution follows it around."
-How are you, Solly? -I'm good. And you?
All right. You made a lot of money today. Shukr Alhamdulillah.
Make sure you always spend it in the store and Allah will bless you.
-Goodbye. -Bye.
[in Afrikaans] Fucking shit!
[in Sesotho] Ace of spades. Ace of spades. Ace of spades!
Old man, 2 rand a bet.
[whistles] Ace of spades.
-Mondy. -Come on, sweetie. You, over there.
If you get this one, I'll buy you a hair relaxer for your hair push-back.
-Mondy. -What?
-Why didn't you come to school? -Leave me alone, I'm hustling.
Come on, man.
Cops! Let's get out of here!
[policeman] Stop!
[Solomon narrating] Brenda Riviera.
She doesn't live in the same reality.
-She chooses to be part of this. -[in isiZulu] You guys are late.
She's smart. She's beautiful.
-Brenda, sorry. -And she's mine.
Brenda. Brenda.
[Mondy] Yo, what's the problem with your girl?
You know what?
How are you guys going to study when you're in jail?
Hey, Brenda, Mandela is in jail, right?
But he is studying.
All the people that are leading us are educated.
And look at you. You don't want to go study.
And you're wearing a school uniform. What nonsense is that?
We've got a history exam and you didn't study.
Don't tell me about his-story.
Let me tell you about our-story. Stop for a second.
Do you know what happened in 1652, when Jan van Riebeeck landed?
He flooded the entire place with Coloureds!
Then Vasco da Gama came here with his big ship and dumped all his spices on us.
Now everything we eat is too hot.
Do you know Shaka Zulu, huh? I didn't think so.
Do you know Queen Modjadji? The Rain Queen.
Huh? You didn't know her. Do you even know Hlatshwayo?
It's "Cetshwayo."
Yes, that one.
Do you know who killed King Hintsa?
Harry Smith.
Don't tell me I'm making a noise. Here's what I say, fuck these Boers!
Fuck Bantu Education!
-Let them go shit-- -[Brenda] Hey. Hey!
Don't you see that there are people around?
Do you want us all to die because of your noise?
Get hold of yourself, there are snitches around.
[in English] Answer my question. What was their mission?
Uh, their... their mission was... was to...
To rape and to plunder. Hmm? Mondy boy! -[hands clap] -[Mondy and man laughing, chattering]
-[in isiZulu] Ah, Brenda. How are you? -I'm fine.
Does your dad know you're here?
Ah. Solly Mahlangu. Hey? What have you got there?
Miles Davis.
Jesus.
Do you know what this is, my boy? Huh?
This is hip.
[in English] Yeah, only they won't teach you that.
They'll tell you that it was to establish a trading post
in the southern, most uncivilized tip of Africa.
[Solomon narrating] His name is Thomas Masuku.
But we know him as Tommy London,
a local Mamelodi activist and struggle hero.
London had been recruiting students to join the ANC,
to ultimately rise against the regime.
I didn't know what to make of him, but he was intriguing.
London was no gangster, but he was dangerous.
And he spoke perfect English. Tommy London.
[man in crowd] Yebo.
[in English] Yeah. We want people to join the movement so we can fight the system.
[Tommy] There's gonna be a march, day after tomorrow.
On the 16th of June in Soweto. Hey?
-[Brenda] Okay. -[Tommy] I'm organizing some busses.
I want you guys to come. Hey?
You know, maybe get some other people to show their support.
[Mondy in Sesotho] Uh-huh. For sure, Bra-T. I'm gonna be there.
-[Brenda] I'm also coming. -[Solomon] Hey, we're not going.
-I said I'm going. -I said we're not going.
[Tommy] Solly, Bantu Education is a joke.
Don't you see they're messing with your brain?
They're making sure that you understand all of their commands.
"Yes, boss. No, boss. I'm sorry, boss."
Hold on a second, I've got something for you.
Hey, kid...
beat it.
-Uncle London, I want to play. -[speaking isiZulu]
[Tommy] Come, now. The grown-ups have business to do.
Hurry out.
[Brenda] I'll buy you a sweet, okay?
[in English] I want you guys to take a couple. Hand them out.
[Mondy] "To hell with Afrikaans."
[in isiZulu] So, I'll see you guys at the bus stop. Behind the station.
-[Brenda] June 16th. -Okay, Bra-T. Can I have my LP please?
You'll get your album on June 16th.
In Soweto.
-[Brenda] Let's go. -Don't stress. Let's go.
Let's go.
-[Tommy] Cool, Miles Davis. -[Brenda] Cheers, Tommy.
All right, kid. You can play now.
Make sure you look after my car.
[Solomon narrating] "Boxing is like jazz.
The better it is, the less people appreciate it."
George Foreman.
-Ah. -[in SePitori] Brother Lucas.
How are you?
Good.
Are you cool?
Yeah. I'm fine.
Happy birthday.
You didn't forget.
[in isiNdebele] How could I forget?
Eh?
Heavyweight.
And the record?
You can go play it.
Cool.
[Solomon narrating] My mother,
a domestic worker who gets paid to raise another family
in the suburbs of Pretoria.
-Hello, Ma. -Hello, my child.
Oh, you've grown into a man. You look just like your father.
-Really, Ma? -[chuckles]
How was your day?
It went well, but the Boers are slave drivers.
[Solomon] Brother, how's work?
A job is a job, Solly. I do my work, I get paid. What can I say?
And you?
-It's okay, but the police... -Solly, they're doing their job.
How does it feel to be a man now? The sack must be getting heavy now.
Ah, Bra-Lucas, I don't know...
-Are you a faggot? -Ah, Lucas...
-[chuckles] -Work is waiting for me. I have to go.
Girls will be flocking. You must go get them.
[chuckling] Brother Lucas...
[coos] Watch out world, here comes my handsome son.
Oh, Ma.
-Where are you off to? -I'm going to Marabastad.
Okay, buy me snuff. This one is almost finished.
-Okay, Ma. Yeah. -You'll buy it for me?
Thank you, my boy. Don't forget your pass.
[sighs] Ma.
-Go well. -Okay, Ma.
[in Sesotho] Sol, man. How are you?
-Hi, Mondy. -[replies]
-Who are you with? -Sure, Miles Davis.
So, the march on the 16th, are you in?
-[sighs] Mondy, I can't. -You can.
-I'm working. -You're a hawker...
I'm supporting my mother and brother.
Your brother. He earns enough working for the enemy.
Hey. Don't come with your shit.
[laughing] Shit? Shit is being a hawker, you sellout.
Yeah? What did you say, boy?
-Solly-- -Hey, hey, hey.
Shit.
Looks like you forgot who took care of you at initiation.
And you, Bra-T...
-Where is my LP? -[hand brake clicks]
[in English] And what about the people? Hmm?
Which people?
[grunts] Mfana, it's cowards like you
that allow all of these white people to rule over us.
Nah, Bra-T. A coward is a person that kills his own black brother.
[in isiZulu] Spider was a worthless traitor.
If Spider were to walk through here now, I'd kill him again.
So you can get killed by just being labelled a traitor?
Then kill me, Mondy just called me a snitch.
-Now you're talking shit, my boy. -Am I?
That's right. Be careful.
-Mondy, let's go. -[Mondy] Fuck off.
[Brenda] Why are you so quiet?
-Say something. -[Solomon] Oh. Okay. All right.
What else did they teach you at initiation?
Hey, Brenda, what happens at initiation stays there.
-But why? Tell me. -It's men's talk.
But who am I going to tell?
-Like I said, it's men's talk. -But who am I going to tell?
Like I said, it's men talk.
Come here.
If you won't open your mouth and tell me,
I won't give it up either.
-Baby, no. -I won't.
Okay, you think you're better than the guys they catch every day?
Brenda...
Look, I lost my father to the Boers. They are cold-hearted.
I've experienced it myself. I don't want to talk about this, okay?
I thought you were not afraid.
Brenda, I'm not afraid of anything.
I'm going to the march. With or without you.
[Solomon narrating] To love someone...
to love you...
is to see my life's greatest ambition personified.
[Solomon in English] Right...
Onions, tamaties, apples...
and bananas.
Uh, Solly, you are short 2 rand.
Uh, no. You guys still owe me 2 rand from last week, hey?
-Uttran, we owe Solly 2 rand. -Yes, we do.
-I'll see you. -Hey, Solly!
-[in isiZulu] Got you, little devil! -[yells]
-[in English] We got you, hawker boy. -[in Afrikaans] Nah, man. Piss off!
Piss off!
[policeman 2] You think you can run from us?
-Think you can run, hey? Bliksem! -[Solomon grunting]
Now we'll see how well you run on a full stomach, hey.
Come. [taps truncheon] Pick him up. Come, come, come.
Let's see you run now.
-[Solomon] Please-- -Uh. Uh. Eat.
-[muffled struggling] -Eat. Eat!
Eat. Eat.
Ah. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Eat it.
Please, please...
Eat. Come. Eat it.
-[muffled] Okay, okay. Okay. -Eat it!
Eat it all.
Yeah?
-[gags, coughs] -Eat it.
-I can't eat any more. -You can't? Why? Why?
Please, I can't.
Maybe we should make him some room, hey?
[in Sesotho] Soweto was a bloodbath, boy.
Jesus. Oh.
[in English] Solly, we are leaving, hey. In two days.
[Mondy] Are you with us? Lucky is coming with us.
[Lucky] Yes.
So, what do you say, Davis? Are you in?
[in isiZulu] Solly, please don't go with them.
Let's go.
[Brenda] Solly, I'm sorry.
I should have listened to you.
Please forgive me for not listening to you.
No, Brenda, I'm the coward.
Don't say that.
I let you go to the march alone,
and I stayed behind.
What kind of man does that?
I'm sorry.
They killed innocent children.
-There were dogs... -[echoing yelling]
...tear gas.
-And stones flying... everywhere. -[marching footsteps]
There was so much noise.
Then it's quiet.
Quiet.
It was horrific.
It was as if I could hear the skin being separated from their bodies.
You could hear their breath being sucked out of their bodies.
Then you'd hear gunshot after gunshot. Even now... I can hear the gunshots.
Gunshots. Children falling to the ground.
Gunshots. Children falling to the ground. Gunshots.
I've never seen so much blood in my life.
Why do those Boers hate us so much? What have we done to them? [sobs]
Why can't they have mercy on us? What have we done?
[prosecutor] If you weren't at June the 16th, why did you go into exile?
[in isiNdebele] I got tired.
Angry.
My family was forcefully removed from our ancestral land.
It killed my father. I had to help my mother.
And my manhood had been violated. I couldn't take it anymore.
What would you do?
[in English] Besides,
we know what you were capable of.
-Who? -The Afrikaner racist regime.
Capable of killing marching students.
-Hooligans and rioters. Criminals-- -Children.
Marching for freedom.
You see, Soweto made us angry. It made me angry.
And to think I wasn't even there.
Policemen killing children.
We were tired of only having stones to throw while you shoot us with bullets.
We were going to fight fire with fire.
[in isiNdebele] Why aren't you eating your food?
I'm not hungry, Ma.
Solomon...
This is not life.
This can't be how God wants us to live.
Kalushi, you don't question God.
God has a way of doing things.
What way is that, Ma?
Look at my face.
What God allows children to be beaten up and shot dead?
Our land... and our father to be taken?
Don't bring your father into this.
Look, I know for certain that if my dad was still alive,
we wouldn't be living like this.
[Lucas] Solomon...
don't talk to Ma like that.
Lucas, Solomon, Jesus is alive. Have faith.
Now, eat, my child.
Ma...
are you still waiting for Jesus?
Waiting for Jesus to come back and fix our problems?
Jesus is never coming back.
He's dead.
They told us at initiation...
when you're dead, you don't come back.
Lucas! You'll kill my son!
What-- What's got into your head?
One of these days you're going to regret saying these things.
Let him go, Ma.
[Martha crying] Let him go...
[Mondy in Sesotho] Where's Solly?
Hurry up. Get inside.
What's with the big suitcase? What did you pack?
Why are you so slow?
-[Lucas] Ma. Ma. -Yes?
-Solomon has gone. -Gone? Where to?
He wrote this note...
"Brother Lucas, Brother Lucas.
I have left. Please don't bother looking for me."
He's gone, Ma.
Since when has he started writing us letters when he goes to work on the train?
Today is a big church day, and I'm already late.
Ma, Solomon has gone!
Listen, find him.
When I come back from church, I want to see both of you here.
These kids will drive me mad.
[Tommy] You're killing us.
What's going on here?
Tommy, this car is stuck.
[in English] This is the middle of fucking nowhere.
Do you know how many police are looking for people like us?
[in isiZulu] Uh... maybe it's the water?
[Tommy] No, man. I don't have time for nonsense.
Hey, Davis, my boy. Here's your LP.
Get your stuff. Eh? Hurry up, man. Let's go.
[man] Tommy, maybe if we try to fix it...
We don't have time to fix it. You fucked up big time.
How did you leave the country?
We used the green border to cross over into Mozambique.
[Tommy in isiZulu] We're marching up and down, the Boers shoot at us.
Up and down, up and down.
[in English] I mean, I was expecting you to come join us at the march.
I thought you'd change your mind, Solly.
Come on, Davis, man, we just wanna know. What was going on?
[in isiZulu] Were you with another girl? Because we were with Brenda.
[in English] We went out there to fight for people's freedom, your freedom.
You didn't even join us.
Now you can't even tell us what was going on?
Hey, London, I didn't ask you to fight for me, nê?
[in Sesotho] Let it go, okay?
-[Lucky] We just want to know. -Hey, man. [tuts]
[Tommy] Hey, Solly, Solly...
Let him go. That bag is probably full of fruit.
Bra-T, we've been walking for a long time. Where is this place?
[in English] Almost there, almost there, Mondy.
We just go down this path, follow it all the way to the river.
-Once we get to the boulders... -[shirt rips]
-...I'm telling you, we are there. -Shit!
[in Sesotho] Jesus! This shirt cost me 50 rand!
[Tommy] Ah. I thought something serious was going on, man.
Bra-T, this is a designer shirt.
Designer shirt, my ass, mfana. You'll replace that in Mozambique.
Mozambique? This is limited edition.
[Mondy] Are you sure there are no crocodiles here?
[Tommy] No. Just move on.
Be careful of these stones.
-Hurry up! -[indistinct chatter]
-[Mondy] Are there snakes in this water? -No, let's go.
[Tommy in English] Come, guys. Almost there.
Whoa!
Yeah!
Brothers, welcome to Mozambique.
[in Sesotho] Vorster, you motherfucker!
We'll be back.
[in Portuguese] Hey, you! Hands up!
-Get down! -Don't shoot!
-Don't shoot. Don't shoot. -This is Mozambique.
We know. We are ANC, comrades.
-Why are they taking our bags? -[speaking Portuguese]
-What? -We are ANC. We are ANC, comrades.
-Get down! -[all shouting]
Get down!
-Shut up! [in English] How many? -Quatro, quatro. Four.
-How many? -There are four of us.
[soldier] Shut up!
[boy in Portuguese] Oh, hello.
Hello.
[Solomon in Sesotho] Mondy...
Mondy...
Mondy, wake up.
-[grunts faintly] -Drink this.
There you go. Like that.
Where are we?
We're in Mozambique.
London and Lucky boy are over there.
-[grunts] -We made it.
Yes, we have.
-Mondy. You'll get better. -[Mondy grunts]
-Davis. -[Mondy] Hello, Lucky.
[Lucky] These Shangaans will kill you. We're not in Pretoria.
Whatever.
[in Portuguese] Thank you.
[in Portuguese] Thank you, Ma.
What's the name of your tail?
Ah. Don't know.
[in English] Hey. What's your name?
[chuckles] Okay. Um...
Mondy. Yeah? Lucky.
And Tommy London.
And I'm Solomon. Huh?
-Say Solomon. -"Solomon."
Yeah, yeah. Good, good. And you are?
[in Portuguese] I don't have a name.
Ay, he's lying, man. There's no one without a name.
[in Sesotho] No, Bra-T. I think he's serious.
This is simple. Let's give him a name.
-Coca-Cola. -Coca-Cola?
[laughing] Yeah, Coca-Cola.
-[Tommy] No, man. -Coca-Cola?
-[all laughing] -No. No, no.
[in Portuguese] You're kidding.
[in English] Call him Fanta, man.
-[Mondy and Solomon protesting] -[Tommy] It's much better.
[in isiZulu] Yeah, man. Add some color to the poor kid.
You see how dark this boy is? He's a foreigner.
Like, "Black like me. Black like me." [laughs]
-Yo. King size. -[all laughing]
Coca-Cola.
-See? -[in Sesotho] So you like the name?
-Okay, come here. -Coca-Cola.
Olá, Coca-Cola. Huh?
[laughing] Coca-Cola.
Solomon, Coca-Cola.
-[laughs] Coca-Cola. -[laughs]
Yeah, man. Jesus. [sighs]
-[in Portuguese] One. -"One."
-Two. -"Two."
-Three. -"Three."
-Four. -"Four."
Five.
[in isiZulu] Hmm? "Bread"?
But you heard him, right?
[in English] Okay, gents, we... We've been here for months now, man.
Either we plan our escape or we buy our way out of here.
[in Sesotho] I am with you, Bra-T.
The food here is shit,
the toilets stink...
Look at this bread, you could use it as a soccer ball.
And I can't take jerking off anymore.
Mondy, be serious, please.
I am serious.
[in English] Hey, hey. We must get word to Lusaka, man. They must get us out.
I've got a plan. How much money have we got, hey?
Solly, the man...
Oh, Miles Davis, wena, you're always seven steps to heaven, mos, hey?
Plan B.
[Solomon in English] Bra-T.
Next time, get your shit together
so we don't end up in situations like this.
[in isiZulu] A little English and you think you got balls?
[tuts] Shit.
[Tommy in Portuguese] Here, Cola. Go.
Go. Go.
[Solomon narrating] With the help of Coca-Cola,
we managed to get contraband paper,
and started a letter-writing campaign to the ANC in Maputo
to give word to Lusaka.
-[excited chatter] -Smuggling out a new letter every week,
pleading for a rescue.
After six months in Xai Xai, Mozambique had begun to take its toll.
But we could not give up.
[Lucky in isiZulu] Okay. Now, look here...
Ah. You're naughty. [chuckles]
[Mondy in Sesotho] Bra-T,
we've been in this shithole of a country for six fucking months.
Is this what you brought us here for? Huh?
It's Portuguese, FRELIMOs, kids named Coca-Cola,
mosquitoes biting us, kids constantly crying, the rain doesn't want to stop...
Bra-T...
[sighs] Do something.
Are you finished?
What are you looking at?
This looks like my shirt.
-Answer me! -[Coca-Cola yelling]
Mondy, what's wrong with you?
He's a kid! Have you lost your mind?
[in isiZulu] Fuck off, shithead.
Go cool off.
[in Portuguese] Hey, Cola.
Don't mind him. Okay?
I have to find Mondy.
This is a river when we have floods.
My mom used to wash me here.
It reminds me of her.
That was before the war.
[in Portuguese] You must miss her a lot.
Yes.
-[female soldier] How many? -[male soldier] Four.
-Take me there. -Yes, Captain.
[in isiZulu] Are you from South Africa?
I'm talking to you!
[all] Yes.
[in English] Pack your things.
-What? -She said, "Pack your things."
Hey, guys, the ANC answered our letter, man.
-[excited exclamations] -Let's go, let's go!
-[in Portuguese] Let's go, let's go. -See you later, with your funky food.
[in Portuguese] And this tail?
-[soldier] He can stay. He's an orphan. -No, I'm not.
[in Portuguese] No, no. He's with me.
[in English] Hey. The first rule of survival is to look after number one.
[in isiZulu] If you want to survive, you better listen to me.
[in English] Let's go.
[in isiNdebele] Sorry, sister, you're making a mistake.
-[in Portuguese] He stays. -He's with me. He's with me.
-He's with me! -No! Solomon!
-[Coca-Cola] Solomon! Solomon! -[Solomon] Hey! He's with me!
-Don't leave me! Solomon! -Coca-Cola!
-Solomon! -Coca-Cola!
-[fading] Solomon! Don't leave me! -[shouting, clamoring]
Solomon!
[female soldier in English] Follow me.
Get in.
It's got nothing to do with you.
[in Portuguese] UNITA traitors.
[in English] It's between the MPLA and UNITA.
Follow me.
This will be your home for the next few months.
Get comfortable.
Comrades, this is your engineering camp.
Training will commence soon.
[in isiZulu] Gents, you can see how it is.
Let's be vigilant.
[in English] Let's watch our backs. And watch each other's backs.
Comrades, we will now be moving on to combat and military operations.
-Viva, ANC, viva! -Viva!
-Long live the Freedom Charter, long live! -Long live!
-[all in isiZulu] Power! -Is ours!
-Is ours! -Power!
I've just received word.
Comrades, our commander-in-chief, O.R. Tambo, the general,
has got a very important message for us.
Please come closer, comrades.
[Tambo in English] All our commanders, cadres and commissars in Angola, viva.
[all] Viva!
-To all of you in Mozambique, viva. -Viva.
-All of our compatriots in Angola, viva. -Viva!
-Viva uMkhonto weSizwe, viva. -Viva!
There are three fire settings on the AK-47.
It's safe.
Ehlisa, all the way down, semiautomatic single fire. Bang.
Yeah?
Commander, when will we each get issued with a Kalashnikov?
Soon, comrade. You will get your weapon soon.
Yeah?
And, Commander, when do we go back? When do we actually start fighting?
Comrade, you must remember, this is an essential part of your training.
It's dangerous to pick up a weapon when you do not know how to use it.
You're not mercenaries. You are freedom fighters.
-Are we clear? -Yes, Commander.
-[shouting] Are we clear? -Yes, Commander!
[Tambo on radio] ...battle to the white minority regime of Vorster
to avenge the blood of over a thousand innocent students
-who only said, "Enough," to Afrikaans. -Fire!
Compatriots, we are not killers, but revolutionaries.
Long live the revolution.
-[in Sesotho] The power! -It belongs to us!
-It belongs to us! -The power!
-Are you scared of them? -No, we are not! We want them!
-[in isiZulu] Power! -Is ours!
-Is ours! -Power!
-[in Sesotho] The power! -It belongs to us!
-It belongs to us! -The power!
...comrades.
[in Afrikaans] The mieliepap is fucking cold.
Hey. That's the language of the oppressor.
[in isiZulu] You know, comrades,
Bantu Education is an instrument used by Verwoerd, and now by Vorster,
to ensure they have an endless supply of uneducated laborers.
It is there to protect the stronghold of the Boers. Finished!
[Solomon, in English] I agree. I mean...
I think the regime is an enemy to African people, to African consciousness,
But I think eventually it's going to be an enemy to the white people themselves.
[in Afrikaans] Mm-hmm. I agree. Are we not all free-born men?
Hey, man. There you go again with your Afrikaans.
-[Afrikaans man] Ah, piss off! -[all laughing]
[commander] Comrades.
The Charter says to protect each and every South African that lives in it.
Black, white, Indian or Coloured.
It doesn't matter who gave birth to you.
What matters is that you are part of the solution
that's going to bring down imperialism.
Then you belong here.
"uMkhonto weSizwe." What does it mean to you?
What do we want to achieve?
What is the nature of our struggle that we face?
Well... we are the spear of the nation.
Our purpose is to fight the enemy.
Yeah, but... we are more than just fighters.
We're lovers.
Che Guevara once said that revolution is the greatest act of love.
Love for one's people. Love for one's country.
That's what the MK is.
That's our cause. It's love.
[Mailer in English] Solomon.
Where in Angola did you receive your training?
Uh, it was an engineering camp outside Luanda.
And please, tell the court...
when you received your training, were you taught to avoid all forms of civilian casualties?
were you taught to avoid all forms of civilian casualties?
Yes.
[sighs] It was stressed at all times that we should avoid civilian casualties.
The court will take a short recess.
[training soldier] Ready...
Fire!
Cease fire, comrade. Comrade! Comrade!
Stop firing!
[in Spanish] What's happening, fucker? What is your problem?
[in English] What the fuck is your problem, huh?
Have you got a small dick? Huh? Is that why you shoot like that?
If anyone does something stupid like this again, they will face a firing squad.
-Is that clear? -[all] Yes, Commander.
[in Spanish] Do you understand?
Y-Yes, Commander.
You faggot.
[in English] At ease!
[female commander] Comrade, can I have a moment, please?
I'm sorry about your friend Coca-Cola.
But he will survive.
I was once Coca-Cola.
But your friend Mondy is out of control. You need to watch him.
It's what happens when you... when you believe so strongly in something.
And what do you believe in?
I believe in change.
I mean, we shout it, we yearn... but nothing.
I think it's time we did something.
I like your passion.
However, remember that revolutionaries are ready to kill or be killed.
Have you ever killed someone?
No.
Well, don't be in too much of a rush to do it.
You don't want to see life fade from someone's eyes.
You watch their soul go away...
and you know that you took it.
You don't want that on your conscience.
Leave.
Yes, Commander.
Commander. May I have a word with you in private?
-Can it wait, comrade? -Uh, no. I'd rather it not, Commander.
It's about our mission into the country.
Commander, I understand how important this mission is to the movement.
So... I'd rather not go with some of the members of my cell--
Uh, decisions were taken at the highest level.
It's a practical matter. You go with the guys from your area.
-No, I understand, Com-- -That's an order, comrade.
Let's carry on with our briefing.
Comrades, you have received training in sabotage. Correct?
Yes, Commander.
You now know how to manufacture homemade explosives from commercial materials.
-Military combat works. Yes? -Yes, Commander.
All government targets. And avoid civilian casualties.
Stop basic services like the post office...
-...police stations... -...or all electricity powers.
[male commander 2] In the course of the next three weeks, you'll receive further instructions.
Stay away from the public eye. Comrades, remember, never panic.
[male commander 1] Cadres, you are now part of MK's Transvaal Urban Machinery.
Gentlemen, you must remember you are in the frontline states.
[female commander] Comrades, stay close to the radio.
Do not lose it.
If anything happens, it will be your key to survival.
[driver in Sesotho] This is the path you need to follow.
Go well.
-[driver mutters] -[all] Cool, cool.
Hey, comrades. There's our DLB. Come, come.
[in English] Comrade Mondy.
Comrade Lucky.
There's something else here.
-[Mondy in Sesotho] Fuck! Take cover! -[Tommy groaning]
Bra-T. Are you okay?
-[Tommy] I can't see! I can't see! -[Lucky] Okay, okay.
-[Solomon] Come. -[Tommy] Comrades, take everything.
[Solomon narrating] For our protection, our DLB had been booby-trapped.
A fact Comrade London had forgotten.
[Tommy] Do you see somebody? Is there someone there?
-[farmer] Kira! Leave it! -[barking stops]
Yes? Can I help you?
[Tommy] We are looking for apples.
-How many? -Four. And we are expecting one more.
Jesus, London. I've been expecting you since yesterday.
-C-Come in. -[Tommy] Comrade, move.
Come, comrades, quickly.
Jeez, where were you guys? Your travel documents were ready yesterday.
Apologies, comrade. We got held up.
Comrades, London has lost a lot of blood. Gonna have to go on without him.
I can still get them across.
Look, it's just a small cut. Come on, Dawood.
London, I've been treating cadres for many years now.
And the next hospital is five hours away in Manzini.
I brought these boys here. Okay? They are my responsibility.
I brought these boys here. Okay? They are my responsibility. -[phone rings] -[Solomon] No.
Comrade Dawood is right. You're in no condition to travel.
-And we still have a long way to go. -[sniffs]
[whispering] Bra-T. We can't leave you here, man.
[in isiZulu] Yeah, Bra-T, Mondy is right.
Yeah. Yeah, gents. I'm gonna take you boys across--
Comrade London...
Comrade Dawood has just informed you that you are in no condition to travel.
So I suggest you heed his advice.
-[phone clicks] -[Dawood] That was Lusaka.
Told them about the accident and our situation.
Really must make those DLBs safer. You're not the first one.
Also, they said Comrade London must remain behind to recover.
Huh? Uh... No, no, no. What about the mission?
-No, the mission continues. -[Dawood] Mm.
Look, we're already a day behind. And I know the Eastern Transvaal.
I was born there. And he and I went to initiation there.
-So I can lead us. -Good.
I'll let High Command know that Comrade Kalushi is your commander from here on.
Uh, wh-what?
Do you have a problem, comrade?
[in Sesotho] Yes, I have a problem. What makes you so special?
-I have family there. -So what? What makes you so special?
-And I'm better equipped to lead us-- -Equipped? You, equipped?
-[arguing] -Comrade!
You've never had the discipline--
-What discipline? -Order, comrades!
-Hey! -[arguing stops]
Hey. That's final.
Comrade Kalushi will take you guys across the border. Are we clear?
As I was saying to Comrade London, your travel documents are ready.
-Just need your photos. -[Solomon] Right.
[Dawood] Next.
Next.
Now, comrades, remember, the Swaziland police are very finicky.
So don't give them cause for suspicion.
Good luck, chaps.
[grunts] Here's 1,000 rand.
Here's your instructions to the next DLB. You know what to do.
[in Portuguese] The struggle continues, comrade.
Thanks, Comrade Dawood.
-Who are you? -I am Byron Sikhosana.
-What? -Byron Sikhosana.
And what you doing in South Africa?
I am visiting family.
[in Afrikaans] Uh, sir, what do you think?
He looks like a terrorist to me.
-[in English] Welcome to South Africa. -Thank you.
-Who are you? -Jabulani Sikhosana.
[radio announcer] With the anniversary of June the 16th only four days away,
police and army have intensified their efforts.
All major routes to Soweto are being monitored.
It is believed that two battalions are on standby at nearby military bases.
-[in Sesotho] Solly, we've got a plan. -What plan now?
-We have to go to Soweto. -Our mission's in Tembisa.
-[scoffs] Who is in Tembisa? -Our mission's in Tembisa, not Soweto.
Did you hear the radio? We are needed in Soweto.
What if the commanders have another mission in Soweto?
Man, fuck the commanders.
[in isiNdebele] Phineus. It's me, Mahlangu. Open.
[Phineus in isiZulu] Who's that, knocking like a policeman?
What do you want?
[chuckles] Cousin, it's been a while. How are you?
Cool, Phineus.
Cool.
Mondy. Last I saw you was at initiation. You didn't finish, you dog!
Don't start with your shit.
Yeah... Why are you all so serious? [chuckles]
Who's this?
Oh. Lucky, Phineus. Phineus, Lucky.
Cool.
Come in, we're drinking.
Why are you so angry?
It's cold outside. [chuckles]
-You're sitting around drinking. -[glasses clinking]
Phineus, is that manhood?
[chuckles] We're just chilling.
[in English] Gents,
sitting here complaining about how you're oppressed in your own land
won't solve anything.
It's time to fight back.
It's time to educate yourselves.
To discipline yourselves.
[in Sesotho] It's time we fight them. It's time we killed these dogs.
No. Killing won't solve anything. Discipline will.
[chuckles] Whoa, guys...
are you guys serious?
Phineus. Our freedom is serious.
Hey.
The train leaves in an hour. Let's go.
-Huh. [scoffs] -What the hell is this?
[Solomon narrating] We went to Tembisa to do our reconnaissance for the mission.
[in Sesotho] You can see for yourself.
There is nothing happening in Tembisa.
[Solomon in English] Okay. So what do you guys want to do in Soweto?
[Mondy] We've been trained, man. Hey? Pretty boy.
Let's go and give our people hope.
[Solomon narrating] Mondy and Lucky had a point.
We were soldiers now. We belonged on the front line.
Let's move out.
Go.
[Solomon narrating] Soweto...
[salesman] Apples, bananas.
[whistles] ...bananas.
[taxi driver] Dube. Dube. Dube.
-[Mondy] Orlando? -This is the one to Orlando.
Plus two, plus two, plus two?
Relax. We're almost there. One more person.
Where are you going, gents?
Ah, Orlando.
And what do you have in the bag?
It's just some luggage.
Shit!
[Lucky in isiZulu] Solly! Solly! See you at the meeting point.
Okay, cool. Mondy!
-[Mondy yelling] -[Solomon panting] Mondy!
-Hurry up! Hurry up, man! -Fuck!
Mondy!
Hurry up! Hurry up, man.
-Hey! -[Mondy] Let go of me!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
-Put him down. Put him down! -[Mondy grunting]
-[Mondy] I swear I'll kill him. -Stay where you are.
Don't shoot.
[in Sesotho] You'll shit yourself, asshole!
Mondy-- No, Mondy! Mondy.
Solly, get up!
Run, Solly!
Mondy!
Run, Solly!
[Mondy echoing] Solomon. Solomon!
[Mondy echoing] Where is he? Where is Solomon?
-Hey, piss off, man-- -[gunshots]
[in Afrikaans] This is a terrorist attack.
Who do we appoint to work on this?
The prime minister asked me personally to come here all the way from Pretoria,
to make sure that we...
[in Afrikaans] Come, men. Come, come, come!
-...you, do things right. -[man] Shut up!
Come on!
-You're wasting my fucking time! -[Mondy breathing heavily]
Pick this thing up!
[Mondy groaning] Solomon... Solomon.
We need someone smart. Someone with a cool head.
Minister, may I introduce to you...
Head Inspector Eric van Heerden.
-Come, come, come! -Close, man. Close.
-Shut your fucking mouth! -[Solomon groaning]
He will handle the case.
Van Heerden, we don't want any problems here.
You will handle this case with purpose and efficiency.
-Do we understand each other? -Yes, Minister, perfectly.
Good day, gentlemen.
You going to talk now?
You think you're clever?
Who is Solomon?
Are you enjoying this, Jabulani?
Do you want us to stop?
Tell me, who is Solomon?
Byron told me I should ask you.
Don't want to talk, huh?
I'm asking you one more time.
Who... is... Solomon?
[in English] You fucking useless kaffir!
-[in Afrikaans] Hi. -[van Heerden] Hi. What's happening here?
-What do you mean? -I'm trying to put the case together.
You're beating the shit out of them while I'm trying to question them.
[scoffs] We're softening these kaffirs up for questioning.
[in English] Solomon Kalushi Mahlangu.
Where did you go to school?
I already gave you my statement.
Do you want me to bring those other guys back?
[clicks tongue] Okay.
Lucas Mahlangu works as a prison warder.
Lives with Martha. Mamelodi.
It's your family.
And then there's this, uh... this Coloured.
Brenda.
Your girlfriend?
My family have nothing to do with this.
I'm just asking.
-Where'd you go to school? -They don't know anything.
"Brother Lucas, Brother Lucas, Brother Lucas.
I have left. Please don't bother looking for me."
So, when you wrote this letter for Lucas... where did you go then?
I ran away from home.
Really? Really?
So how did you end up on Goch Street with military-grade weapons
where two innocent people were left dead?
Okay.
Where'd you go to school?
Mamelodi High School.
Mamelodi High.
[imitating Solomon] Phineus.
Phineus.
[in Afrikaans] Ready to talk?
Come.
Walk.
[van Heerden] Gentlemen, I am due back in court. Keep it brief.
[minister] You went too far with the Motloung interrogation.
Yes, uh... With all due respect, Minister, he was like that when you appointed me.
Yes, but what are the implications?
Can the other one stand trial? What's his name again?
-Uh, Mahlangu. -Yes, yes. Can Mahlangu stand trial?
Uh, yes, Minister. But most of our witnesses point to Motloung...
Ugh, man, Motloung, Mahlangu... Fucking kaffir names...
I don't give a damn about your witnesses. Will someone hang for this, or not?
-Minister-- -What sort of message will we be sending?
Two white people are dead. Murdered in cold blood.
Two good reasons why this Mahlangu dog should hang.
Minister, but what if we can't prove that Mahlangu...
Fuck it, van Heerden.
Was he one of the fucking kaffirs running around the streets of Johannesburg,
firing machine guns and throwing hand grenades, or not?
-Did two white people die, or not? -Yes, Minister.
Don't underestimate the long arm of the law.
[guard] Come.
[in English] Welcome to Pretoria Central maximum security prison.
When you leave here, it'll be in a coffin.
Okay, let me get this right.
You'd gotten away. Why did you go back?
I heard gunfire.
And Mondy was shouting for help.
So I knew there was something wrong.
You had the chance to escape. This is your life, Solomon. You went back.
I couldn't leave him behind.
-[man yelling] Come on... -[Mondy] Solomon, help!
[older man] Bastard!
-[moaning] Solomon... -[Solomon] Hey! Hey, hey!
-[sirens wailing] -Hey, put it down, man! Put it down!
-[younger man] He was shooting at us. -I don't care. Step back.
-[moaning] Solomon... -Hey, stay away!
Mondy. What have you done? Mondy.
-[doors opening] -[sirens approaching]
-[Solomon mutters] -[policeman in Afrikaans] Get them!
[policeman 2] Drop your weapon! Drop your fucking weapon!
Sorry...
[in Afrikaans] Take them away!
So... that's when they took us to John Vorster.
That's what happened.
We'll see what we can do.
It's going to be uphill all the way. But we will fight.
I work in John Orr's warehouse, in the workshop.
I'm a mechy-- A mechanic.
We were having tea in Mr. Kassner's office...
Uh, there was myself, Mr. Kassner, Mr. Wolfendale and Mr. Hartog.
Hey, that guy Ted, he's only but an idiot, hey?
-Hell, that oke is dof. -[long-haired man] Yeah, he's really dof.
-Ah, dof or not, I'm still gonna watch it. -[men laugh]
We were having tea in my office when, um, this young Bantu appears at the door.
-[prosecutor] Who? The accused? -No, the other one.
The other one? Motloung?
-[papers shuffle] -Motloung.
You've identified him now, you identified him earlier, and previously at the lineup.
-Motloung. -Yes. Motloung.
[mechanic] Yeah, you can say that again. Hell, that oke is dof.
Dof or not, I'll still watch it.
[Mondy panting, whispering] Sol!
-[man] Pass the sugar. -[Mondy] Solomon!
Thank you.
Where is he?
[prosecutor] Motloung arrives at the door. Please tell the court what happened next.
-He says, "Where is he? Where is he?" -Where is Solomon?
Uh, and we didn't know what he was talking about.
-"Where is he?" He said nothing else? -Just that.
Look, you must understand, we're used to the Bantus just coming to look for work,
or just being bothersome Natives sometimes.
And we los them.
But this oke...
-Where is he? -Who?
-Where is Solomon? -What?
...comes to the door and then...
...he pulls out a machine gun, and he starts shooting.
-Shit. -His gun stopped. Uh, jammed.
Mr. Kassner and Mr. Wolfendale lay dead on the floor.
Um, when he started shooting, I dropped to the floor and then I started crawling.
And a bullet grazed my arm and I fell under the table.
I... I could see that his gun had jammed, and I said, "Kenny, let's get him."
Kenny, quick! His gun has jammed. Let's get him!
I looked for a...
I found a... um, a steel pipe.
And, um, I... It was on the filing cabinet.
[Mondy screaming] Solomon!
And then I went over to him and I...
I... I hit him.
Solomon! [screams]
-[groaning] Solomon... -[gunshot]
[mechanic] The accused, he came from the back of the warehouse.
Solomon...
But, Your Lordship... [stammers]
I don't know why he's on trial, I mean...
he did nothing, nothing.
He didn't shoot at us or nothing--
Mr. Bragg, that's enough. You may step down.
All rise.
Okay. Today went well.
A key witness of the prosecution clearly stated
you were nowhere near the scene of the shooting when it happened.
That's a win.
In actual fact, he only remembers seeing you after the shooting.
-Exactly. Exactly. -Okay. Let's not get carried away.
Look, get some rest.
How's your foot?
Oh, it's good. Better.
We'll see you tomorrow.
Uh, Mr. Mailer...
Sis Priscilla...
Thank you.
Thank you both.
Phineus...
-[sniffs] -Phineus...
do you stay at 1112 Msolozi Street in Middelburg?
[interpreter] Yes, that's my home, my lord.
[prosecutor] And do you know the accused, Solomon Mahlangu?
-Yes, my lord. He is my cousin. -Right.
And do you remember what happened
on the evening of June the 11th, 1977
at your house?
My lord, Solomon came to my house along with Mondy Motloung and Lucky.
And do you remember, were they carrying anything?
Phineus, were they carrying anything?
They had bags, suitcases and groceries, my lord.
My lord, for the record, Exhibits A1 through 10.
Those are the bags. These are the groceries.
Guns.
Bullets. Grenades.
With which they were going to terrorize the people of South Africa.
Do you recognize this, Phineus?
-[speaks isiZulu] -Yes. That's an LP, my lord.
I know it's an LP. Who does it belong to?
-[speaks isiZulu] -My lord, Solomon left it at my house.
[prosecutor] Which proves he was there on that day.
Now, Phineus, did Solomon say anything to you?
Phineus, did he say anything to you? My lord, I really need some help here.
Can the witness please speak up?
-[in isiNdebele] Young man, speak up. -I heard!
My lord, he gave us a speech.
Okay... and what did he say in the speech?
My lord, he said we should join the ANC so that we could kill the Boers.
[prosecutor] Join the ANC...
so that you can kill white people.
And that was the last thing he said?
No more questions, my lord.
Any questions, Mr. Mailer?
No questions for this witness, my lord.
Witness can step down.
[in isiNdebele] They are done with you. You can step down.
[in English] We ask you, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy...
[in isiNdebele] It's painful for him to have been sold out by Phineus.
Our own blood.
Didn't they say that Mondy is the one who fired?
Yes, Ma.
[in English] But the law of common purpose says...
Solomon is also guilty, even if he didn't shoot at them.
[in isiNdebele] It's their law.
Uh... Brother Lucas.
Brenda.
[in isiNdebele] Um... How's Ma?
She can't hold on anymore.
All of us are struggling with this.
That's why she didn't come to see you.
Ma said I must give you this.
Tell her I said thank you. It will keep me warm.
So...
I apologize for leaving you on that day.
It's okay, don't worry. It's in the past.
Is everyone doing okay at home?
They are well.
I love you, Brenda.
I love you with all my heart. Always.
-I am scared. -Shh.
Don't be.
When you think of me,
look up at the heavens...
and I'll be with the stars.
We're going to get you out of here.
I know the majority of the warders here.
-What are you talking about? -I'm talking about an escape.
When I get to Mamelodi, I'll talk to Bra Frank.
The windows in these cells are big enough to climb through.
Bra Frank will be waiting for you.
-Brother. Brother. -Brenda. Brenda.
Brother Lucas,
I have caused enough trouble for our family.
-We can get you out. -Shh.
It ends here.
I have accepted it.
It's best you do the same.
I love you all.
It's time.
I have to go.
[Solomon narrating] We left our homes and went into exile in search of freedom.
But freedom is within.
The MK prepared us for war. But here there were no guns.
-No grenades. No comrades. -[door opens]
-[guard] Mahlangu. The court is ready. -Here there were chains, walls and steel.
This, no one can prepare you for.
This was the final battlefield,
-where we took our last stand. -[door closes]
Will the accused stand.
During the past weeks...
I've heard the state's presentation on the State v. Solomon Mahlangu case.
I do not propose reading all the evidence in my reading of the judgment.
I want to focus on the matter of common purpose.
I want to mention...
that when the accused was presented with the opportunity to flee the scene
with Lucky on June 13th at the taxi rank, he did not.
Allow me to remind you that the accused went out of the republic
on his decision to obtain military training.
And he came back with two of his fellow comrades.
And there can be no doubt that they acted with a common purpose.
They had already, and were, carrying out a common intent.
If the accused had the intention of abandoning the firearm,
or disassociating himself from Mondy Motloung,
he would have run away while at the bottle store section.
In those circumstances, the pulling of the firearm trigger
that caused the death of those two innocent gentlemen
is as much the pulling of the trigger by the accused,
because they shared a common intention and a common purpose.
In those circumstances, we have to come to the conclusion
that there are no extenuating circumstances.
You have been found guilty on all charges.
Is there something you can tell the court before pronouncement of your sentence?
All we want is freedom.
That's all we want.
Freedom.
Freedom for children to learn.
Freedom for men to work, for mothers to love,
for a nation to grow. That's...
That's all we want.
Equality.
For everyone.
You see... I am just one of many.
A foot soldier.
There will be many, many more to follow.
So there is no court of law...
no police force...
no army
that will stop the tide of revolution from turning.
There is no punishment that you can lay out in this court,
no law your government can pass
that will kill the will of the people.
Because we will fight.
We will continue to fight
until all our people are free.
And maybe we can even free you from yourselves.
So, you can hate us,
degrade us,
torture us and kill us,
but we will fight.
And we will be free.
One day we will be free.
-[in isiZulu] Power! -[sobbing]
-Power! -Is ours!
Solomon Kalushi Mahlangu...
you are hereby sentenced to death.
You'll be taken to Pretoria Central Prison on a date to be set,
and you will be hanged by your neck until you die.
[Solomon narrating] And finally, Miles Davis said,
"If somebody told me I only had an hour to live,
I would spend it choking a white man.
I would do it nice and slow."
But in my final hour I say this,
"My blood will nourish the tree that will bear the fruits of freedom."
[woman 2] It was
absolutely wrong from the beginning.
[woman 3] I personally think it was an experiment for him,
some sick game.
[woman 4] I think about the "why" every single day.
Hi, Jacoba, this is Dr. Webber calling.
I have your lab results in.
So give me a call when you have a chance, and we can go over those.
-Thank you. Bye. -[faucet running]
Hi, this message is for Jacoba Ballard. This is Jane over at Dr. Chan's office.
Give us a callback. We want to reschedule you for an appointment. Thanks so much.
[Jacoba] Growing up, I felt different.
I'm this blonde-haired, blue-eyed person
in a family with dark hair
and, like, olive skin and dark eyes.
So, I kept asking my mom
if I was adopted.
I kept, like, reassuring my parents,
and I'm like, "It's fine if I am, you can tell me. It'll be okay."
Finally, my mom told me the truth.
So, I've known since the age of ten
that I was from donor sperm.
[woman sighing] I believe it was 1979,
and… I wanted a child so bad,
but my husband could not have children.
So I went to see Dr. Cline
for artificial insemination.
I was young.
I think, like, 20, 21.
He was professional.
[Debbie] Uh, we didn't really say a lot.
I mean, he just told us that he would match us with a donor
I mean, he just told us that he would match us with a donor that looked like my husband.
He was gonna use medical students,
their sperm.
And so, when I start ovulating,
I went in, they did the procedure…
and, um, I went home, and I was pregnant.
[Debbie] She's my everything.
[smacking lips] I love that child more than life itself.
[Jacoba] I always had this longing for siblings.
I just wanted somebody that related to me,
that's, you know, my brother or sister,
and I just wanted to have that bond.
When I was around the age of 18,
you know, around, like, 1999,
there wasn't commercial DNA testing.
All I knew was my mom went to Dr. Donald Cline,
and he was the go-to doctor.
My mom was told that
they used a medical resident for donor sperm,
and they never used the medical resident or the donor,
say, more than three times.
So, since there was me, I figured that I might have one or two half-siblings.
I figured that I might have one or two half-siblings.
So, I looked him up, and I called him at his office.
He actually answered the phone.
I wanted to know if he had a donor number
or my mom's medical records
to where I could have some kind of identifying information.
He was very
straightforward, matter-of-fact,
um, no empathy. But I remember asking him,
like, telling him I wanted to find half-siblings,
and he said that I can't ever know that information.
My mother's records have been destroyed.
[Jacoba] He wished me good luck, and that was it.
I just went on with life and, you know,
married, raised my children, and hoped that someday maybe
I would find a sibling or two.
Watching our friends' children growing up around us
left us feeling isolated and desperate.
But as we found out, we were not alone.
One out of five couples living in the United States
experience infertility problems.
[promo narrator] The physicians and staff at Indianapolis Infertility
can help you understand your particular infertility problem more clearly.
Both Dr. Donald Cline and Dr. Robert Colver
are specialists in the field of infertility
and have achieved excellent results
in diagnosing and treating thousands of infertile couples.
[woman] Dr. Cline was the best-known infertility doctor in Indianapolis.
And I started working for him
in '81 to '94.
I worked 13 years.
[man] I was partnered with Dr. Cline from 1987 to 1991, and I have to say,
my career wouldn't be what it has been over the last 35 years
my career wouldn't be what it has been over the last 35 years if it hadn't been for Don Cline. So…
You know, I have a very special place in my heart for that man.
Before '85, for an insemination
or for a donor insemination,
fresh sperm was used.
And back then, you didn't have, like today,
you go on a website, 300 guys show up.
[Jan] We had a notebook
so they could pick from what donor criteria they wanted.
The hospital was-- It's just right across the street.
And I actually went to the hospital and met some of the donors
because they were residents, and I knew 'em.
And they would pass me the specimen, and I would take it back to the office.
It has to be kept warm, body temperature.
And so I transported the sample in my bra,
so the sperm was still viable by the time I got it over at the office.
It was a great field. It was really interesting.
We were putting tubes back together so people… women could get pregnant.
And he had a terrific success rate at that.
[Robert] We'd do laser surgery on tubes,
and that was a new thing that Don did that other doctors didn't do.
For these couples, you have to have them
really think through this, talk through this, pray about it.
Really feel like you thought through this whole thing, because
once you do that donor insemination
and they get pregnant, that's their baby. Forever.
[woman] It was always very emotional when one of your girlfriends would call you and say she was pregnant
when one of your girlfriends would call you and say she was pregnant
because there were several times that I'd get off the phone,
and I'd just cry because I wanted a child so bad.
My husband and I had gone to various fertility doctors
trying to find… my issue.
It was hard on me and my husband.
But I thought, "Okay. I've finally found a doctor that might be able to help us
because he was so well-known."
I was about 27.
I, uh… My husband and I talked about having our own children.
My husband got tested, and he was infertile.
I was told, "The only person who's doing live sperm donor insemination
is Dr. Don Cline."
"He's the best of the best, so go to him."
[Liz] By that point, it'd been two and a half years
of having my period when I wanted to really conceive,
taking my temperature, and… for every month and every day.
So it was the first time I felt-- It was hopeful.
[Dianna] I carried my husband's sperm in a little container.
Well, we didn't have much time because you had to have it there,
I think, within an hour.
And then there was this room
that I would go into for the artificial insemination,
right then with the sperm,
with some kind of long, like, um…
Well, it looked like a needle-type thing, but that was all I remember.
[Liz] He'd walk me back to the exam room,
I'm lying down, and my knees are up in the air.
He said, "Okay. I'm gonna, uh, put this… this specimen in you."
So I wait on the table for about 20 minutes.
I was thinking actually positive thoughts.
I was thinking,
"Wow. I might be able to have a child."
When the doctor's office called me
and told me I was pregnant,
I… I couldn't believe it.
[Dianna] We were just so happy when I had her.
I even took Julie back into the office and then showed her off to Dr. Cline.
I thought I had altitude sickness.
So I laid off a little bit of skiing,
and ate more crackers, and drank some tea,
and, um, never thinking I was pregnant.
I thought I was just late.
I was ecstatic.
I thought it was a gift at the time.
[Jacoba] In 2014, you see 23andMe
on, like, every other commercial on TV.
I was 35,
and I told my husband I was gonna take a DNA test
because I figured, at least, I had one or two siblings.
I felt like it was kind of a bonus if I did find the donor,
but that wasn't, like, my goal. My goal was to find a sibling.
[Jacoba] The fall of 2014,
I received my results.
I remember that day vividly.
It came back that I was related to
seven siblings.
It was actually immediate excitement, um,
with concern.
Finding out that I had siblings was amazing,
but there's, you know, eight of us. What… what's going on here?
Because my mom was told
that they never used a donor more than three times.
Three times was the ideal.
We didn't want a large population
with all the same father.
There's the concern for consanguinity,
uh, having too many people in a certain geographic area
that could potentially be your brother or your sister, and you didn't know it.
Because you could potentially have a brother and sister marrying.
This doesn't make sense.
Obviously, you used someone's sperm more than three times.
[Jacoba] And that's when we started to do our own investigating.
Every weekend, we would call each other,
or we would plug names into Ancestry and work on a family tree.
We joked one day, trying to figure it out,
and we're like, "Wouldn't it be crazy if it was the doctor?"
But we disregarded it, and we're like,
"Probably not, but we'll go through this journey together."
"We'll help each other find who our biological father is."
We were able to just focus on our paternal matches,
and we all matched a lady named Sylvia,
who was our second cousin,
and she was on 23andMe.
So, we had messaged her.
I asked her what surnames was in her family tree,
and she gave us a whole list of names.
One of the names that popped up was Swinford.
Swinford is Donald Cline's mother's maiden name.
I said, "By any chance,
do you have the name Cline in your family?"
She said, "Oh yes, I completely forgot. My cousin Don."
"He's a doctor."
[Jacoba] Right then, my stomach dropped,
and I felt sick because she just confirmed
what I think we probably already knew, but we were hoping wasn't true.
Dr. Donald Cline
could be our biological father.
I was in shock.
There were so many emotions.
So many questions.
He lied about a donor being used.
Why did he do it?
And how long did he do it?
And how many siblings do we have?
I honestly didn't know who to go to.
I googled, like, "Where do you make a complaint against a doctor?"
That, in turn, led to me filing a complaint
with the Attorney General's office for Indiana.
So, then I received a form back from the Attorney General's office
that was like, their generic messaging like,
"Hi. We've received your complaint, and it's gonna be investigated further,
and someone will be in touch."
We waited and waited. Nobody was returning my calls.
No questioning, nothing from the Attorney General's office.
[Jacoba] I wanted answers.
So I reached out to every news outlet, big and small,
and nobody would pick up the story.
…and I'm Angela Ganote.
Yeah. We're starting off on a chilly start today,
but it's gonna warm up and warm up fast.
[Jacoba] I was watching TV one day,
and I was like… [exhaling sharply] …"Her!"
-[phones ringing] -[Jacoba] "I forgot to send it to her."
[Angela] In February of 2015, I logged onto Facebook,
and I had a message from Jacoba.
The message was in-depth,
saying that she believed a doctor in Indianapolis
had inseminated multiple women with his own sperm.
It was shocking, but it was also backed by proof.
Before Jacoba came to me,
she had reached out to Attorney General of our state,
the Attorney General of the United States.
She had reached out to national news organizations,
and she had gotten no response.
And I thought, "Why is no one listening, or at least
finding the truth?"
I walked into our news director's office,
and I said, "You guys are not gonna believe this."
[Angela] I reached out to Dr. Cline in the very beginning.
He told me that he was not the father.
He told me that he only used sperm from a doctor in training,
that there is no way possible
that the siblings had more than three brothers or sisters.
I asked if he would like to see the DNA evidence.
I asked him if he would like to provide his own DNA
so that he could help them.
"If you're not the father, have a DNA test and prove to them."
And he wouldn't.
[Angela] So when we first aired the first story,
I couldn't use his name, and that was, um, hard for me.
Sisters, born here in Indiana, uncover a family secret.
Their dad is not their biological father.
They are donor children,
the product of an anonymous man who donated his sperm.
[Jacoba] Since we didn't have Donald Cline's DNA,
we couldn't really move forward
until we had him take a DNA test
to prove that he was our biological father.
Like, we knew it in our gut, but we didn't have anybody at the state
that would get back with us, and
they weren't in any hurry to get a DNA sample from him.
[Jacoba] So, one of my half-siblings
messaged all of Cline's children and grandchildren
that were over the age of 18.
Basically said,
"Our mothers went through infertility treatment."
"Did somebody in your family donate sperm?"
[Jacoba] It was probably a week or two later,
Cline's son messaged me.
So, I met with Doug and Donna,
which are two of Cline's children, with his wife, Audrey.
I chose to do it at my church
because I felt more comfortable.
I don't know these people,
and these are some big accusations.
They said they had talked to their dad,
and he did admit that he was our biological father.
But Doug said that the only time that Cline used his sperm
was when he didn't have access to a donor,
and as far as siblings go,
there was absolutely no more than ten.
[woman] I had seen the news pop on one night…
[Angela] …they are donor children searching for answers…
[woman] …and I saw Jacoba on TV, and my husband thought that we looked a lot alike.
and my husband thought that we looked a lot alike.
My husband's exact words were,
"I don't feel like this is going to end well,
and I want you to be aware of that."
So I talked to my mom.
[Dianna] My daughter called me and said,
"Should I get tested?" And I said, "No."
'Cause I, at that point in time,
I thought it was my husband's sperm that he had used.
She said,
"You know, honey. This doesn't apply to you."
"This doesn't pertain to you at all. I know you're your dad and I's."
Um, but something in my gut, I just couldn't let it go.
So I notified Jacoba via Facebook.
She wasn't really sure if this would pertain to me at all,
'cause I was supposed to have been from my father and not a donor.
So she said the best way to do it is just take a test.
And once I took that test,
if we were related, her name would show up.
Hardest thing I've ever had to go through.
Go back to everything that you've known about yourself.
[Julie] It just completely washes away your identity.
And you really have no idea who you are anymore.
We both cried on the phone,
and then I had to…
…figure out a way I was gonna tell my husband
'cause I knew that it was gonna devastate him.
I said, "Remember when we went to Dr. Cline?"
And I said, "Unfortunately, um,
Dr. Cline didn't use your sperm. He used his own."
"So…
we're just now finding out that Julie is not yours."
My husband started crying.
And he said that, and I'll never forget these words.
He says, "He's taken everything away from me."
And he did.
It's hard.
I mean, what did he do with my dad's sperm?
He just threw it away like it was nothing?
I mean, it's just-- It's wrong.
[Jacoba] After I met with Doug,
he had called me and said,
"I will do whatever it takes to get you the answers."
And I said, "We want to meet him." "We have questions for him."
"I want him to look us in the eye."
"You at least owe us that much."
[Jacoba] And so he set up a time for myself and five other siblings
to be able to meet Cline.
[Jacoba] It was almost like the moment that his feet hit the floor,
you could hear his footsteps,
and you could hear his cane.
He was not showing emotion.
And on his hip, I could see the outline of a gun.
I think that it was partially to intimidate us.
So he introduced himself, and he went around the table, asking each one's name, age,
and he went around the table, asking each one's name, age,
and what they did for a profession.
It was almost like he was ranking us.
Like, "Let me see
which one of my offspring made it to the top."
I felt like we were being judged.
Then we asked about medical history
because some of us, we have autoimmune disorders and stuff.
He said that there was nothing that we needed to worry about.
He had a piece of paper with him
that he brought scripture on.
Jeremiah 1:5.
[Jacoba] I remember him looking at me and going, "Jacoba, this is for you."
Because he knew I was having a hard time with this,
and I'm like, "Put that shit away."
I said-- I did, I said, "Just put that shit away."
"You're not gonna use my God to justify your actions."
One of my siblings did ask him why he used his own sperm.
And he said that he only did it
because he felt like the mothers
were just basically desperate for a child,
and he was doing it to help them.
Finally, he said that the absolute number,
there would not be more than 15 siblings.
[man] It's just too fucked up.
I… I just felt bad for my mother.
I mean…
here she was, you know,
a young woman just wanting to have a family
like anyone else.
It's a sick individual that puts themselves in that position
to be able to do that.
There are parts of me that wish that I never had to deal with infertility.
I wish that walk on no one.
The way it worked for me with Cline is, uh,
I would go to his office.
[Liz] He was always the only one in the office,
whether I was coming in on a weekend or during the week,
during the midday, or late evening.
He was the only one that greeted me in his office, which was strange.
[Liz] And now the truth is that,
as Cline was closing the door
and I'm undressing and putting my feet in the stirrups
getting ready for him to bring in the donor's sperm,
he was in the-- some other place in the office ejaculating,
and not only creating the erection, but he has to go in full force
in a sexual manner to create that ejaculation.
To me, that has always remained a very sad part to me,
and disgusting.
That he was placing then his semen
into some kind of syringe,
and then he's got to place that syringe at the base of my cervix.
[Liz] The fact that he
was still in an endocrine high
from having the ejaculation
has no place in a medical setting.
[Liz] When Matt's DNA test came back…
my first words were,
"I was raped 15 times and didn't even know it."
[Matt] This is unbelievable.
How the fuck did no one know?
I mean, just even the act of what he did
for so many years,
and to just get away with it
for decades, and no one knew anything.
No one in the office? Come on.
Well, here's the thing.
There wasn't much traffic on that first floor
other than we'd come directly into our office.
Don could have clearly collected a specimen,
and then he got it back, and no one would know.
They could-- The nurse could be in there for the insemination.
They wouldn't know if it was a donor from the hospital or not.
Dr. Colver and I have discussed it, and we had no idea.
It just was never a thought,
because it was so totally opposite
from his normal behavior.
[Angela] This was a person of a position of power.
He's known in our community as a philanthropist.
He's known in our community as an elder of the church.
[Jan] He was always a doctor.
He was not gonna sit there and chat with you.
It was all pretty much
doctor-person relationship.
Or a stern father figure,
if, you know, if you can relate better to that.
Mark was stationed at Grissom Air Force Base,
and so was Don,
and we were socially friendly.
I would say arrogant fits him, for some reason.
I mean, I don't know exactly why I felt that way.
You… you do because you were in study groups and so on.
Uh, he was… he was okay. I mean, he obviously was a bright guy.
He thought he knew-- He did know a lot.
He always was confident. He always was self-assured.
He wasn't-- I never saw him doubt
that what he was doing wasn't right.
If you knew something, and he knew something, he knew more.
That was his attitude.
He always belittled how much I knew about child de--
He always belittled how much I knew about child de-- You know, child development, even.
I mean, that was my area of specialty.
Uh, I… I have a PhD in neurobiology,
and I'm also, um, an occupational therapist,
and I treated preemies.
But he knew more.
If you crossed him…
…that was it.
[Angela] The first conversations that I had with Dr. Cline,
he told me that he was protected under HIPAA.
He told me that I could be sued or that Fox 59 could be sued.
[Angela] He made it very clear that I needed to be careful.
[Jacoba] So, that's when Cline called me.
I was in shock.
I don't know what it was in me.
He called my home phone, and I recorded that conversation.
-[Don] Jacoba? -[Jacoba] Yes.
Uh, this is Dr. Cline.
Uh, do you have time to talk with me just a little bit?
-[Jacoba] Yes. -[Don] Okay.
Um, I'm getting, uh, a real problem with, um,
uh, the television station, um, 59.
[Don] Um, they are demanding, um, that I meet with them.
Uh, I can't do that.
Uh, it's not fair to me. It's not fair to you all.
Uh, they're… they're trying to make a, um…
They're… they're trying to, um…
improve their ratings,
and, um, my wife and I, after 57 years of marriage…
Um, if… if this comes out,
uh, our marriage will be over.
can you help?
[Jacoba inhaling deeply] I mean, no disrespect,
but I feel like what you're telling me is to keep my life a secret.
That I am not allowed to know who I am…
-[Don] Well-- -…when I didn't do anything wrong.
[Don] Well, yes, but you know, I didn't--
At the time, I didn't feel like I was doing anything wrong either.
[Jacoba] But you-- I feel like I'm being blamed for this, like it's my fault.
[Jacoba] But you-- I feel like I'm being blamed for this, like it's my fault. I don't understand.
[Don] It's, uh, it's your fault because I don't care who you tell.
It's just
putting it on television for the entire world to see.
[Jacoba] Well, I… I cannot… Like I said, I can't control her.
I can't stop that. I can't.
[Don] Well, because you… you… you can stop talking to her and say,
"You know, I… I just don't want to share anymore."
I'm just telling you what's gonna happen,
and I'm going to be hurt badly.
[Jacoba sniffs] Well, that's what's happened to everybody so far,
and you know, that… that's because of the actions--
[Don] This tells me that that's exactly what you want.
[Jacoba] When you push me, I'm gonna push back 100 times more.
So when he called me, it's like,
"Bring it on."
[Jacoba] "Bring it on because I'm ready to fight you."
♪ When I go, don't cry for me ♪
♪ In my Father's arms, I'll be ♪
[Jacoba] I contacted the Attorney General's office again
to get a status on this complaint,
and nobody was returning my calls.
[Jacoba] So I decided to investigate him myself.
[Jacoba] I started researching everything about him,
from papers written, to articles,
to conferences he had attended, to blogs.
[Jacoba] It was so much research.
[Jacoba] I had just papers everywhere
to prove that I wasn't some crazy maniac. ♪ All my tears be washed away ♪
[Jacoba] He wanted me to keep quiet.
And he wanted me to keep quiet
because he knew that there were more siblings.
[woman] My husband gave me a DNA test as a gift,
and then I got a message saying,
"I think we're related."
When it all hit me, I kind of
just sat and stared for the rest of the day.
And then, for the next couple of weeks, had a complete identity crisis,
and I couldn't look in the mirror. I didn't wanna think about where I got my hair from,
I didn't wanna think about where I got my hair from, or where I got my eyes from,
because I had always thought those were from my dad.
There was never any reason that I would have questioned anything.
My parents trusted their doctor,
who said that it would be better for me to not know,
and that I would never find out.
[Jacoba] Every time that a new sibling pops up,
I know that I'm going to call them,
and I know that, um, I'm going to ruin their life.
It's hard because we know what we went through.
[crying] And we're making someone else go through this exact same thing.
[Heather] The first people who reached out to me were Julie and Jacoba.
I messaged them back and said, "I need some time to process."
"I'll reach back out later."
Um, and so it was probably a couple of months
before I, um, actually reached out
to… to have a conversation with anyone.
your world is changing.
[Jacoba] When you have new siblings pop up,
you are on the phone with them for hours
because it's the worst day of their life.
You've lived that over and over and over.
[woman] I asked for a DNA test for Christmas,
and I was really confused
'cause all of these random names to me
were popping up, and it said, "Close Family."
And so I really did not know what "Close Family" meant.
It did… did not even-- I did not even think,
"Oh, brother or sister," I didn't even think, "Cousin."
I got a message that a new sibling popped up,
and I logged in, and it said, you know, "Lisa,"
and her last name, and I was like, "Huh, I know her."
Her husband taught my daughter on the softball team.
Um, my daughter and her daughter played basketball together.
I sent her a message, and I said,
"Hey, did you happen to do an Ancestry test?"
She said, "Well, do you know about the Dr. Cline story?"
And she said, "He's our father."
And I honestly, I started laughing.
I… I was… thought Julie was kind of crazy. I was like, "What are you talking about?"
"There… there's no way he can be my dad."
And then I called my mom.
I said, "Hey, Mom, did you and Dad ever have any issues conceiving me?"
She said, "Well, I didn't, but yeah, your dad did."
And so my heart dropped a little bit.
And she said, "He actually had a low sperm count,
and his doctor recommended us to a specialist."
I said, "Mom, was this specialist in Indianapolis?"
And she said, "Yeah, why?"
And I said, "Was it Dr. Donald Cline?"
And she said, "Yes."
[Lisa] She said,
"I went and had the procedure done twice,
but both times your father was there with me and provided a sample."
And so, at that point, I realized my mom and dad had no idea.
They thought all along that I was my dad's.
[Lisa] I worry for my kids,
especially I have siblings that live in the same town as me,
and our kids go to school together. And so, I've had to have the talk with my daughter about,
And so, I've had to have the talk with my daughter about,
"You've got to be careful when you start dating."
"We got to be aware of who this person is,"
but it's definitely a huge concern.
When we get a new sibling alert,
you're praying, "Please don't let it be somebody I know."
Or "Please don't let it be somebody I dated."
And I'm sure it's bound to happen.
[Jacoba] The majority of us live in, like, a 25-mile radius of each other.
There's also quite a few that live within minutes of Cline.
[Jacoba sighing] I walk around,
and I could be related to anyone.
I mean, it's just common for me to pass people on the street,
um, at work, wherever I may be,
and, I mean, I'll look at them and think,
"Oh, the way you stand, the way you look."
"You could be related to me."
[Matt] We live in this small community.
[Matt] Everyone that you interact with
appears to have some sort of connection to Cline.
My dentist across the street was a patient of his.
My next-door neighbor was the nurse to one of my half-siblings,
and then there's this connection, or there's that connection.
"Oh, my mom saw them at the nail salon."
I think without a doubt, there are probably people that I've met
that are my half-sibling, and I just don't even know it.
They don't even know it.
[Jacoba] Who knows how many siblings we have?
[Angela] I had emailed Dr. Cline and told him,
"We're moving forward with the story. We would be using his name."
You know, "This is the time for you to come clean to the public."
So, finally, he said, "If there's no audio and no video, I will meet with you."
I asked him if he wanted to come to FOX 59.
He said no. I said,
"There's a restaurant close to the TV station."
And I wanted to be close to the TV station because I wanted to make sure for my safety.
I wanted it to be someplace that I felt safe.
My boss at that time wanted me to take our security guard with us
because she feared for my safety.
We knew that Dr. Cline did not want to, quote, "be outed,"
and Jacoba told me that he carried a gun.
We thought that he was desperate.
[Don] She is, um, uh, demanding I meet with… with them.
They're going to force me to do this.
-[Jacoba] Mm-hmm. -[Don] I've gotta tell the truth.
-[Jacoba] Mm-hmm. Well-- -[Don] And I don't want to do that.
[Angela] I was very nervous,
and when he came in, it was within minutes he's asking me
if guns are allowed in the restaurant.
And I'm thinking, "What a weird thing to say to me."
Then I'm looking down, and it looks like he has a gun underneath his sweater.
There's something bulging on the side, and I'm thinking,
"I don't wanna be crazy, but is there any chance
that he could pull out a gun and shoot me?" I honestly thought that.
[Angela] One of the first things he said in our conversation
was that he knew where I lived,
and he knew where I was from.
Remember, this was after he had said before,
"Be careful."
The meeting was about an hour long,
and I feel like he was begging me
to not air the story.
He said, "It will ruin my marriage."
"It will hurt my church. I'm an elder at the church."
[Angela] I let him know that we have that burden to tell the truth,
and the truth matters.
[Jacoba] So that's when, like, the whole whirlwind just started with him,
and strange things started happening.
[Jacoba] I had woke up one day,
and all of the lug nuts were missing off of my car.
And I'm talking all four tires.
And that's scary.
So, yeah.
[crying] And you can't tell me that that's like some freak… Yeah.
I was hacked.
Everything that I had saved to a Google Drive
of publications of Cline was just erased,
and every single email regarding him was gone.
[Heather] Soon after I went public,
I started getting harassing phone calls,
like the cemetery asking if I wanted to buy a plot
for me to be buried in.
I think it was to rattle me.
to… to re-traumatize me so that I would be quiet.
I don't think he wanted, um, any of us to talk publicly if he could help it.
[Jacoba] In my gut, I feel like we're being harassed and stalked
to get us to shut up,
especially when Cline called and threatened me over the phone.
[Don] What you're doing is that you're telling the world,
and the world doesn't need to know.
-I-- -[Jacoba] I'm not trying to do harm.
[Don] Well, you are.
[Jacoba] I'm not scared of you.
You can threaten me,
but I will never back down.
I am going to expose you.
[Jacoba] And I'm gonna expose all of your secrets.
[Jacoba] I found out that
in 1963…
[Jacoba] …he was driving…
[Jacoba] …and this little girl darted out between two cars…
[Jacoba] …and he hit her.
[woman] No!
[Jacoba] She ended up dying.
He has told everybody that's when he changed his life.
That's when he found God.
[Mark] That traumatized him.
After that, he became more religious
and, um, churchgoing than he had been before.
Maybe he thought that this was his way of giving back,
that he took a life that really wasn't his fault.
Now, he was going to give back.
Maybe that was a psychological process going through his mind.
But it doesn't really matter because that should not have been a way
But it doesn't really matter because that should not have been a way that he was trying… to try to, uh, make amends
for some terrible accident that happened.
[Jan] He was very religious,
had very deep roots,
and he and his wife taught marriage counseling in their church.
and he and his wife taught marriage counseling in their church. They taught Sunday school.
And whenever he was in the office and all of us were there,
he would sit down, and we would wait, and he would say a prayer.
He, at some point, asked me
if I was Jewish,
and I said yes.
And I said, "And by the way, I'm very uncomfortable with your office
full of all kinds of Christian sayings."
Things like, "If you want to get into heaven,
you need to be Christian."
Yeah. I knew… I knew Donald Cline.
[man] The church is set up where they have an eldership.
So they have seven or eight men
that governed the church body as far as what was taught,
and he was one of those elders.
We would go over to his house for baptisms.
Literally, 50 to 100 people would attend baptisms
right there in their… at their swimming pool.
[man] That's where we really got to know them.
From a Christian perspective, you have to say,
"Hey, we… we all have skeletons in our closet."
"We all have done things that we regret doing."
[man] I know that he and God have reconciled that.
That he's been forgiven, and that he has moved on from that,
and he's a different person now.
[Jacoba] He portrays himself as this godly man.
And I know we all make mistakes,
but I think there's more behind this.
What made him
every day wake up and decide to go into his work,
masturbate,
and place it unknowingly inside women without their consent.
He could've stopped at any point,
but he kept doing it over and over and over and over.
[man] Growing up, I kind of knew that something was off.
Something was different.
You know, why do I got blond hair, blue eyes?
[man] Everyone in my family has dark eyes and dark hair.
So, I got an Ancestry kit just to figure out where I came from.
[man] When Ancestry results came through, my coworker said,
"Well, you'll have 11, 15 hits on Ancestry."
Well, when I opened up mine, I had over 3,000 hits.
[Jason] And then immediately after that,
Jacoba called me.
"I'm your sister."
And she told me the truth.
I don't even know how to tell you the emotions that came over my head.
Took me to an incredibly dark place.
Why? Why feel the need to do this?
Is it to… to further your career?
Is it to be the best of the best?
Is this to create life?
Is this some sort of sexual thing?
Like, I don't know.
I feel like he's hiding something more sinister.
[Jacoba] Jason, we talked on the phone a lot before we got to meet.
Hey, how are you?
This is crazy.
[Jacoba] I know!
Jason and I are very similar.
Like, we can read through people's bullshit.
When someone isn't religious,
and you're gonna use religious verses to justify your actions,
that just makes it even more--
Worse. I would have just laughed at him.
Well, and it makes it even more of a reasoning of people saying,
"That right there is why I would never be religious
because of fuck nuts like you."
And it took all I had in me
to talk to him on the phone that day without going off.
And I thought, "You've just got to remain calm
because you're recording this, and try to get as much out."
Let me hear it.
[Don] You know, I know that nothing happens without God,
um, allowing it.
[Jacoba] See, I think that's where our problem is.
I don't think that God should have allowed it in the first place,
and I really think that we ask ourselves every day, "Why are we here?"
I think that's, like, a lot of our problems. [scoffing]
Yeah.
[Don] Well, you know, I mentioned one of my favorite, um…
One of my favorite scriptures was Jeremiah 1:5.
If you'll remember, it says,
"Before I formed you in your mother's womb, I knew you."
[Jacoba] Mm-hmm. Yeah. [Don] Um,
and… and that tells me, and it should tell everybody
that no one is born as a mistake.
Before I knew you, in your mother-- What it… What was it? It's--
"Before I formed you in your mother's womb, I knew you."
Jeremiah 1:5.
Which really just kinda…
nails it all home that he knew what he was doing.
He knew exactly what he was doing with us.
I've just become obsessed with the story
and trying to piece everything together.
When I was sent an email
from someone at the Attorney General's office,
I would go through, and the person that sent me the email,
and every person that was copied in on that email,
I would search them on Facebook.
And one of the people with the state
has a "Quiverfull" email address.
That's when it was--
"What is Quiverfull? Like, what the hell is it?"
God says, "Children are a blessing."
"We should want to have our quiver full of them…"
[Jacoba] Quiverfull. It's essentially a cult
aimed to having as many children as possible.
If a man with his wife has a lot of children,
he will send them out as arrows.
He's like a warrior for God, and he sends his children out
as arrows into the world, who will be ambassadors for God.
[woman] The children are raised to actively participate in government,
to actively run for office,
to seek positions of political prominence,
and eventually that the civil law will actually be the Bible.
[Jacoba] Lo and behold, Jeremiah 1:5,
the verse that he kept using
is one of the Bible verses
that Quiverfull uses.
[Jacoba] Basically, for them, women are just-- You… you breed.
Was Cline in this Quiverfull movement?
[Jacoba] Were all of us part of some sick, twisted, secret society?
There's so many theories that I've thought of in my head.
[Heather] I think the philosophies
or the beliefs of the Quiverfull movement seem so outrageous to me
that it's hard for me to actually believe that it's real.
I agree with that and that we could even be a part of it. [Heather] Mm-hmm.
[whispering] Yeah.
[Julie] With the Quiverfull theory, back when we were all conceived,
that theory was to produce more of the white race
because they were in fear that other races were infiltrating that
and the white race would eventually disappear.
I mean,
when you look at that wall of babies,
it is all Caucasian babies.
[Jacoba] It's crazy because every time we get a DNA match,
it's like, "Yep. Looks like one of the Cline boys,"
or "Looks like a Cline girl."
Most of us have blond hair
and blue eyes.
I hate to say this 'cause it sounds so-- But it's almost like
we're like this perfect Aryan clan,
and… it's disgusting.
It's sad that we have to have conspiracy theories
to understand why he did this.
If he would just tell us, then we wouldn't have to go through
of trying to find all these different reasons…
Life would be easier for him if he did.
It would help all of us heal too.
But you're not gonna get that from somebody
that does not have compassion or any empathy.
It's disgusting to sit there and lay in bed at night,
and wonder if the person that created you
is some racist bigot,
and he used my mom as a pawn.
[Jacoba] And he did it over and over and over again.
I didn't ask to be born.
I didn't ask to be born into this situation.
But this is my life.
[Debbie] But it's not your fault.
No, it's not, but then you have this man who shares half of my DNA.
Our DNA.
[Jacoba] There's just so many theories, and I…
I don't think we'll ever know why he was doing it,
but
I want him to have to pay for it. I want an investigation.
I want him punished.
[Jacoba sighing] The Attorney General's office didn't give a shit.
We were told that they couldn't give us any information
and we weren't allowed to know.
And we just kind of got disregarded.
The one person that we had was Angela Ganote,
calling and asking them, "What are you going to do?"
[Angela] I had started back in 2015,
asking the Attorney General for an interview,
asking anything that I could know about this, and they would tell me nothing.
And then I also reached out to the Marion County prosecutor
and said, "Is anyone listening?"
Finally, the spokesperson from the Marion County prosecutor's office said,
from the Marion County prosecutor's office said, "Angela, I'm sorry. I don't-- Somehow I missed it."
I laid out a long paragraph of the whole story and what had happened.
I had even sent our story that had aired and said,
"Did you watch our story? I've been asking these questions for more than a year,
I've been asking these questions for more than a year, and I'm getting nowhere."
"And I feel like it's time that the prosecutor, or the Attorney General,
or somebody sits down and answers the questions that I have."
When we got the media inquiry,
there hadn't been any true investigation done anywhere yet.
But at the end of the day, there's just no crime that touches
this particular act.
That's our problem.
So I remember we were sitting there,
and, um, you know, we're asking him,
"How is this not rape?"
I don't deny that it was a sexual violation.
But legally, it isn't a sexual violation.
"I feel like my mother was raped"
is a valid human emotional statement.
But…"Dr. Cline committed rape"
is a legal assertion that was not true,
and I wasn't gonna put it on paper
with my signature.
And I said, "What about battery?"
And… [scoffing] …he got rude with me.
He said, "I don't know how many times I'm gonna have to tell you this."
"I can't charge him with battery. It wasn't battery."
I, uh, was so pissed.
I looked at Tim Delaney, and I said,
"So if I spit in your face right now,
it's not battery?"
And he said, "It is, because you'd be spitting on me."
And I'm like, "What the fuck?"
"So a doctor can go jack off
and put their sperm in a woman
who's their patient that did not consent
to have their doctor do that,
but yet, you're gonna tell me that if I spit in your face,
I'd be arrested and charged with battery?"
Jacoba and a lot of the individuals touched by this were very emotional,
and had, um, a feeling that what I was there to do,
wasn't to apply the law
to determine whether or not Dr. Cline had committed a crime.
They thought I was there to deliver catharsis.
And I wasn't.
There's unequal application of the law. It happens every day, it happens all over the United States,
It happens every day, it happens all over the United States, and it happens here in Indiana.
Was there fraud?
Was there something else?
I just didn't feel like it was investigated enough
to look at what could he have been charged with.
There was never a good explanation in my mind.
[Liz] I had a copy of the Indiana sexual assault law,
and I said, "Surely, there's somewhere in this law that you can say--"
He says, "No, it has to have both components. It has to have force
and non-consent."
When you talk about rape,
there is a provision in Indiana law that says,
"Rape can include conduct
which a victim does not know is sexual, but the perpetrator knows is sexual."
And that, I think, is actually the closest charge,
because in order for him to produce this sperm sample,
he had to masturbate in very close proximity
to the office where a patient was waiting,
unclothed from the waist down,
with a paper cloth covering her knees,
and knees spread apart.
Who's to say when this touch
stops becoming sexual and starts becoming clinical?
I think even if he's not thinking of the patient in a sexual sense,
the very fact that he's still under the effects of physical arousal
makes this a sexual touching.
Even if he's thinking of his wife or a pink fuzzy bunny rabbit,
it is still a sexual act.
But I also think we have to see Tim Delaney
in the context in which this case was brought.
And so when I interviewed Tim Delaney,
he said that Indiana juries
were not willing to buy rape-by-deception theories.
The jury is going to say, "This woman consented to insemination."
"This woman wanted a child." And the question is always out there,
"Does this woman's desire for a child legitimate Donald Cline's deception?"
And unfortunately, that is a question
that Tim Delaney had to weigh would enter into the minds of jurors.
[Debbie] If he asked me if it'd be okay for him to be the donor,
I would have not said yes.
I would say no.
It was a violation of him into me.
The issue for me is there was no consent.
He didn't give me a choice.
[Angela] The Attorney General's office had at least
reached out to Dr. Cline at some point
and asked him if he… if he had used his sperm,
or had asked some sort of question because Dr. Cline told me that.
He told me that he filled it out,
and that he denied anything, that he wasn't the father.
I don't know what's in that letter 'cause I've never seen it,
but I know what our conversation was.
Dr. Cline told me that he talked with the Attorney General's office
through paperwork,
and that… he was not the father.
That was really what ended up getting him in trouble,
because he lied to me, and I knew it,
and he lied on the paperwork to the Attorney General's office.
So at one point, I reached out to the Attorney General,
and say, "You know he's lying to you."
He lied and said that he never used his sperm
to inseminate his patients.
[Tim] Only after we determined that the Attorney General's office
had sent those letters
were we able to come up with a theory for how to proceed.
We wanted to nail him with something,
and the fact that we finally got something,
it was like a "hurrah" moment.
And not only that,
he also added that he was going to sue me
for libel and slander.
[Tim] Denying is obstruction of justice,
but denying and threatening, and, to paraphrase, saying,
"Do you know who I am?" was more than enough.
It was like, "Eureka!" The, you know… The bathwater started spilling out.
I said, "Oh my God, we've got an angle."
[Tim] After we began the investigation,
obviously the first step was to get DNA from Dr. Cline.
[Tim] He was sick.
He had pneumonia, I believe. So he said, "Don't come too close."
And we said, "We have a search warrant for your DNA."
He asked a little bit about "What is this all about?"
But he knew what it was all about.
[Tim] Detective Sergeant Carmen Walker
of the Marion County Sheriff's Office said,
"We need you to open your mouth."
[Tim] And he complied.
He did not look like he was enjoying it.
It came back 99.9997%
that I am his biological daughter.
[Carmen] And how many times did you use your own sample?
[Don] Sparingly, but
keep in mind, we're talking 30 to 35 years ago,
and I… I can't remember.
All the records have been shredded.
[anchor] The fertility doctor at the center of a controversial case
is headed back to court to answer criminal charges.
[anchor 2] Dr. Donald Cline is charged with two felony counts
of obstruction of justice for statements he made to investigators.
[anchor 3] The retired Indianapolis fertility doctor
now plans to plead guilty to obstruction of justice.
Prosecutors say he intentionally misled investigators about a case
that's turned dozens of people's lives upside down.
And it was literally 20 months ago
that I got a Facebook question to me, "Angela, can you help me?"
And thank you for believing in them, because no one else did but you.
Yeah, thank you.
He didn't want to go to trial
because more information would come out,
and then also, he'd probably get more of a punishment.
So he changed his plea to guilty.
[Jacoba] I felt good that day at the court hearing.
Even though I knew that all he was being charged with
was two counts of obstruction of justice,
I thought, "Fucking finally. Something."
[Matt] I didn't wanna make eye contact with him. I…
I was afraid of him.
[Julie] Uh, he actually walked right past me and brushed up against me, and…
it almost brought me to my knees.
That was my first time seeing that man
and being that close to him, and there was no regard for us.
[Don] Your honor, I'm asking for mercy
and compassion for myself.
I've tried to live out my life
showing honesty and care to others,
and I will continue to do so.
[Heather] He looked very old
and weak, and part of me thought,
"Is this an act that you're putting on to get the judge to go easier on you?"
I was allowed to give a victim-impact statement
because I was one of the originals that filed a complaint with the state.
My hope was that the judge would be appalled by this,
and that he would at least get, like, some jail time.
These are my words to Cline.
Every time I or my half-siblings look up our name,
we all have the same issue tied to you.
It has caused anguish in everyone,
and some of us have wanted to die from this pain.
For 30 years, my half-sister, Julie, believed her dad was her biological dad--
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevancy.
We had agreed to the wording of the statement.
Literally redlined it.
And I had things crossed out or highlighted that you can't say.
Because of your denials,
I feel you have no consideration for the mothers
who came to you, us as your biological children,
or your wife and the four children you had with her.
It was always about you. You lied. You still lie.
You even have your family believing you, and that sickens me.
-Our mothers trusted you– -[lawyer] Objection!
She… she went for it.
I don't know if I would've had the courage to do that in front of a judge. But, you know…
[Jacoba] I'm asking you to look at the depth of the reasons he is charged with--
[lawyer] Objection!
What we're really getting at
is the inability of victims to tell their stories.
Those who testify can only testify
to… to what is relevant to a criminal proceeding.
But-- And what is relevant to Cline's proceeding was not what happened in the '70s or '80s,
was not what happened in the '70s or '80s, not the births, not the fertility fraud.
It was the lies to the state.
In Cline's proceeding, the state was the victim. They weren't.
[judge] I do want to reiterate, probably for the fifth or sixth time at this point,
that the court, by law, can only consider
the charges that Dr. Cline's plead guilty to,
the obstruction of… of justice charges.
Obviously, it would be inappropriate for me to consider outside of that realm.
What we asked for the judge to do
was twofold.
One, to make sure that these crimes remained as felonies
on his record, and two,
deliver executed time, an executed sentence,
meaning time served in jail.
[lawyer] We received a number of support letters for Dr. Cline.
These are letters from members of the community,
former patients, and members of Dr. Cline's family and church.
These individuals have known Dr. Cline for many years.
And they evidence a strong connection to his family, the community, and that rehabilitation
the community, and that rehabilitation is not only possible but actually has already taken place here.
is not only possible but actually has already taken place here.
[Matt] A lot of folks submitted letters
on his behalf to the judge.
I believe there was one that came from a prosecutor
from Boone County, which is where he lives,
saying that "This guy is a good man,"
you know, "He should get some leniency."
[producer] Is that an odd thing for a prosecutor to write to a judge if it's a friend?
I'd do well not to comment on that particular question.
That's when I, in my gut,
felt like the state was corrupt. There were people corrupt,
and they were friends with him or something.
[judge] Please remember that whatever happens during sentencing,
the people that love you are gonna continue to love you.
[Jacoba] The judge seemed very sympathetic towards him,
like on the verge of tears.
[judge] With the limited resources that we have, overcrowding at the jail,
[judge] With the limited resources that we have, overcrowding at the jail, and your lack of a criminal history,
um, an executed sentence is nothing that the court is gonna order.
I really wanted him to have jail time.
I really did. I thought that that would bring a little bit of closure to me.
I thought that that would bring a little bit of closure to me.
[voice breaking] But… no.
[judge] I know that this is your first offense, but Dr. Cline, I do believe
that the facts support going ahead and sentencing you as a level 6 felon.
Um, as to fines and costs,
sir, the court will fine you $500.
[Julie] And so he got the two Level 6 felonies
with complete suspended sentences
and a $500 fine,
which is a slap in the fucking face.
[reporter] Dr. Cline, do you have any comment at all?
[reporter 2] Dr. Cline, what would you change now if you could change anything?
[Jacoba] This was a span of two years
from me filing a complaint,
to them actually, finally doing something about it.
[Jacoba] And…
…this judge just let this man
pretty much off the hook.
[Jacoba] And I dread every new match that comes.
But they just keep coming,
and you never know the day that you're gonna wake up,
and then they're going to be there.
I just-- Uh, I feel like he…
That this was some sick
game experiment for him.
[Don] As far as I know,
all of the inseminations that I did with my sample,
um, and again it was sparingly,
um, had a healthy baby.
It was, you know, important to my parents
that it was someone that was healthy,
and for him to turn around and violate them
and for him to turn around and violate them and do this without their consent, and
there's a lot of us that have the same health issues.
Almost every single one of us.
[Jacoba] I've been to so many doctors, been to the Cleveland Clinic.
They don't know what's wrong with me.
I'm sick.
And other, um, siblings have, um,
autoimmune diseases and stuff.
I have an autoimmune disease, yeah.
It's, um, a blood clotting disorder,
um, which I didn't know until I had a miscarriage,
and, uh, we were determining what would have caused that.
I mean, I've had…
…colonoscopy, endoscopy, I've had--
I mean, I've spent weeks in the hospital,
losing 15 pounds at a time.
I have a lot of digestive, um, and colon issues, and
no one on my mom's side does.
[Mark] In the early '70s,
I had heard that he was having trouble, uh, operating
because he had rheumatoid arthritis. And he had-- His hands were swelling up.
I… I, at that time, I felt I would hate to see him,
his career of being a great surgeon end
because he couldn't get the right treatment for his arthritis.
And so, I called our chief of medicine,
told him about Cline's problems.
And he said, "Yeah. Well, let me call Dr. B. up there,"
and Cline went down and met with him, and he told him what to take, etcetera.
So, once he got on the right medications, he seemed to be fine.
[Shereen] His symptoms abated.
[Robert] I know in talking to a sperm bank,
30% of the guys didn't even make it
past the questionnaire
because of what was in their family.
History of cancer, history of whatever,
even color blindness, for goodness sakes.
Now, looking back at it, and being like,
"Okay. He's got an autoimmune disease,
um, and his sperm wouldn't have even been allowed
to be a donor because of that."
Like, "Dude, you knew this."
"You knew… you knew you had issues."
"Like, how… how dare you?"
[smacking lips] Yeah.
Now, there's the Don Cline we knew,
that I knew, that I th-- knew well.
And there's the Don Cline I would have never imagined.
Yeah.
Yeah. It broke my heart.
Evil.
And I-- If Don was right here, I'd say that right to his face.
[Jacoba] Still to this day, there are people in his community that back him.
And people that sit there and say, "But he is such a wonderful man."
And I just want to look at those people
and say, "Well, then maybe he should have put his sperm
in your wife without her consent."
"And then how would you like that?"
I took a 23andMe DNA test because,
about four or five years ago now,
my children and I were both diagnosed with a genetic disorder.
I got the results back.
And when I got to the genetic DNA family,
there were half-siblings listed.
And I honestly just thought, "Oh, this is a mistake."
Because by that time,
I didn't know that my parents had any type of fertility treatment
other than receiving fertility medications.
So I kind of just put it out of my mind, and didn't think anything of it.
And then I had a couple messages from Jacoba.
And it basically said,
"I'm sure you're confused by your results."
"Feel free to contact me with any questions."
It didn't occur to me that she was talking about the siblings,
so I just kind of disregarded that message.
[Alison] On December 9th of 2019, a Dr. Phil show aired.
Well, question for you.
How would you feel if you found out
your mother's fertility doctor
was actually your biological father?
When the siblings walked out…
Jacoba was introduced.
You felt no remorse from him, other than just the fear of being caught.
He was not remorseful at all. [clearing throat]
-[Dr. Phil] None? -He just did not want it to be public.
He told me, "The world does not need to know."
[Dr. Phil] Wow.
I, uh, quickly got my phone and opened my 23andMe,
and all of the siblings on that show were listed as my half-siblings.
So then I knew, I knew at that moment,
that there-- That we were a part of it.
I was a patient of Dr. Cline's for many years.
I think he took each case very personally.
At least he did with me.
He delivered the girls,
and he came over with his wife
to see our babies at home.
[Alison] So this is a picture of my twin sister and I
right after delivery, in the incubator.
[Alison] And…
this is the picture of Cline holding me as an infant at the house.
I was probably eight months old there.
I had such mixed emotions in that
the thought that he had used
his own specimen to impregnate me
made me kind of queasy and sick to my stomach.
Whereas, um…
on the other hand,
I thought about the fact that because of his skills
in operating on me,
and… and clearing up some of the things that were causing infertility,
I was grateful to him.
So I had this mix of emotions,
and I have twin daughters
who are absolutely delightful girls.
[voice breaking] And I--
You know, you can't be angry
when you have… you have what you always dreamed of.
Well, it was, um, complex for me because…
I was 47 years old at the time,
and to find out…
…that the man I looked up to and emulated
from the time I was small…
was not my biological father was crushing.
That was the biggest part.
I felt this need to protect him,
and I didn't want people to know.
But the other part of my story is that Don Cline was also my fertility doctor.
is that Don Cline was also my fertility doctor.
[Alison] He was my main GYN.
He took care of all my gynecological needs for the two years that I saw him.
He did my Pap exams. He did breast exams.
I mean, I don't think any grown woman wants…
someone closely related to them,
a member of the opposite sex, to touch them in that way, in such--
It's a very vulnerable position that the patient is in.
And to be touching and examining
private areas of your body. It's just--
It's-- I can't… I can't even think about it without getting upset.
I didn't get to have that knowledge. He knew.
I didn't get to know that or have the chance to say,
"No. I would… I… I'd rather I see someone else."
"I don't… I don't want someone who is biologically related to me
to touch me in that way." I didn't get to do… know that.
It's almost, you know,
it's like… it's like a bad dream that you-- that's recurring.
You wanna wake up.
But every time you wake up, it's not a dream.
[crying] I just can't believe how it was, you know, done to us.
I really can't. And for him to act like nothing happened.
I think that's the worst part of it.
[Don] I don't want you to think that I do this--
I did the insemination with my own sample
very blasé.
Was there a sexual connotation to it?
Absolutely not.
I don't look at these people
and consider them to be my
children.
[Julie] I want zero relationship with him.
[crying] He's not my father.
I may share half of his DNA,
but he's not my father, and he never will be.
I feel sorry for him because his whole life to his wife,
to his own children, to his community, to his church,
to his colleagues in the hospital and his office.
It's all a lie.
I would like to see him pay for what he did…
…but I just, I feel like…
there isn't gonna be any justice.
I'm okay.
This is not my issue. It's his.
[Matt] I think continually putting his name and face in the media,
and telling our story was the absolute way to go.
I'm not gonna run away from him.
Not gonna run away from this story.
If you were not even experiencing problems with infertility,
if you saw Dr. Cline and you have a child,
I think it is important, very important, that you have a DNA test.
Your child has a DNA test, just to be certain that you know
who the father is of that child.
[Jacoba] Instead of destroying me…
you made me realize my self-worth.
That's absolutely what you did.
And you made me realize what my purpose is too.
And I'm a fighter.
And I will fight for every sibling
that I have that I know, that I don't know,
and for every woman that you assaulted.
And I will do this until the fucking day I die.

Listen, Ros...
I think your firmness got rusty from living too long in Java.
Now you're so easily persuaded.
It's not about being persuaded, Brother.
It's for the happiness of our family.
Didn't you see Ita's face that night? She almost lost her mind.
You seem to be very "productive", huh?
My second kid is five years old older
and the first one is eight years old older.
The team fits perfectly.
You're smart, you chose the right woman.
One who's got an "insurance".
Shut it!
Have you tried the grilled goat?
This is the reason people come to wedding receptions.
I'm gonna dig that in.
I've had four plates.
This is really good.
Do you want more?
Can I have one?
Bun, who is that?
That's Pipit, Aunty Rika's daughter.
This is why you need to come to our family gathering!
Cousin, huh?
Yeah.
Bun, please look after him!
Take this.
I haven't had anything to eat.
Come here, Mom is tired.
Go see that with your dad.
That's a lame excuse!
Ican, come here!
What's up, Aunty?
- How are you? - I'm fine.
Aren't you worried about your cousins getting hitched one by one?
Your Western standard doesn't suit us!
But we're really Westerners.
I mean, from West Sumatra.
Don't talk back to your elders, think about your mother.
She really wants a granddaughter.
That poor woman!
Thank you for the sympathy, but it's really okay.
I don't have any granddaughter, that's why I pray that I'll have one.
I'm just saying that he should get married.
It will be hard if he has little kids when he's old.
Sure, but don't pity me, I'm embarrassed.
I'm sorry.
Can...
Come here for a moment.
I'm going to get some more food.
You can do it later.
Just a sec.
I met Aunty Len, her daughter is pretty!
Now she's a doctor in Maninjau.
Okay, let's talk about it tomorrow, let me eat first.
Hey, how are you?
Praise be to God, I'm good. This is my second son, Ican.
Is he married? We can introduce him to Nopi.
Sure, we can. Is she here?
She was here a moment ago, now she's somewhere around...
You want to go home already?
No...
I just want to enjoy some fresh air.
I thought this woman wants to go home.
Why can't you stand a family event?
No, it's Nathan, he can't stay still.
It's normal if a kid can't stay still, but that's a different story for adults.
It's okay, this is Aunty Len from Pariaman.
Excuse me.
Can...
You can't be with that woman's daughter.
I've seen her, she's not good-looking, and she smokes.
Mom, you can't judge people by their looks,
but by their heart.
Don't say it like that.
It's still important to see whether they're attractive or not.
Mom. I need to come out for a moment. Nathan just can't behave.
I need to come out for a moment. Nathan just can't behave.
A moment...
Let's have some coffee.
Alright.
Where are you going after this?
I'll head home, where else I should go to?
But you said you want coffee?
Come on... Are you coming or not?
Who is that? Where?
That girl over there... She's Asril's sister.
I'm off, guys.
Hi...
Hi.
You're Asril's sister? I am.
How come we haven't met?
I've been visiting your house lately to accompany my mom and Rostina.
You're Rostina's brother?
Well, I'm her cousin.
Ican. Rike.
My aunt once said to me...
You're working in advertising, right?
Yes.
Who are you waiting for?
My mom, I don't know what's taking her so long.
That just how parents are.
They say they're just saying goodbye but end up chatting with so many people.
Can, where's the car?
Wait, Mom...
Asril has your number right?
I'll get your number from him.
Can!
Who's that?
Don't do things that will spread false rumour!
No, I'll take the car.
Come on.
Ladies, Allah has destined that every human being has a time limit.
So when the time comes,
they can't postpone it... for even a moment,
nor advance it.
We all have the past, the present, and the future.
Current generations, past generations, and future generations.
All have their own times and ways.
Is that new?
Yes.
It's good to exercise, you'll be healthy.
Young man...
Look at me, sixty-five and fit!
But remember...
Don't drink too much coffee or smoke.
They're not good for you!
How many times can you do it?
As much as I can.
This is good.
Do it again.
Assalamualaikum.
Waalaikumsalam.
I still have more snacks.
Can we bring this home? Sure.
Sure.
I've never seen Ican has a serious relationship with any woman.
He's thirty-two now...
When I was his age, I already had two children.
Ma'am, we'll head home first.
You have them wrapped?
Thank you, Ma'am.
See you later in the next recitation gathering.
We can go home now that we're full.
Assalamualaikum.
Waalaikumsalam.
Ma'am. Maybe God listened to your prayer, Ma'am.
What do you mean?
You remember when he studied in Bandung?
You always prayed that he wouldn't fall for any women.
And not to commit adultery.
Well, maybe God heard that prayer,
so now he's not into women.
Nope! Of course not!
Nope! Of course not! God always listens to parents prayer.
Can...
Can you make a better soap opera? Your office makes films, right?
Yeah...
But we don't make soap operas.
Why not?
You can make a story about a daughter-in-law who loves her
You can make a story about a daughter-in-law who loves her mother-in-law.
It would be great.
Yeah, we will make it.
Soap opera where the mother-in-law is very kind to the daughter-in-law,
and she is Padangnese.
A fussy woman!
Assalamualaikum.
Waalaikumsalam.
Come sit with me, dear.
I brought your favorite goat soup, Mom.
I cooked it myself.
I put lots of gristles.
Ndoy said you like them.
How far along are you?
Praise be to God, it's our sixth month.
I pray for your health.
The meal is almost ready, do you want to eat it right away?
If it's already there,
it's up to me I want to eat it now or tomorrow
Just leave it there.
Mom...
Maya cooked it for you, your tone is uncalled for.
What tone?
She offered it when I'm here watching TV, i just asked her to leave it there.
Yes, but that's not how you should speak to her.
It's not your place to tell me how to speak.
That woman has gotten into you!
Mom.
Try changing the channel.
There's nothing to see in the commercial breaks.
What do you mean?
Just see that...
Please drink the tea.
Do you want some tea?
It's okay, Ma'am.
Can, you haven't showered yet?
Kids nowadays really don't know how to behave.
Ican! Coming.
Come here.
Sit down.
Can. They are our relatives from your father's side.
Indra Tauhid. Poppy Ampeno.
Why "Ampeno"? It's like Javanese name.
That's actually a short for something...
For what?
Date of birth...
My date of birth, fourth of November.
Please excuse me.
Okay.
Where do you go to school?
I'm a college student.
"Okay, I'll pick you up at 7."
Were you born in Padang or in Jakarta? Or did you grow up in Jakarta?
I was born in Jakarta.
My mom and dad were born in Padang.
You've met them, right?
If I am not mistaken...
It was when I was in high school.
You were still in elementary school.
What is your hobby?
My hobby is reciting the Quran.
Isn't that mandatory?
I guess... showering is also your hobby then.
Yes, it has to be done.
I see it as my hobby, so it won't be hard to do.
You're just like my mom.
Miss Poppy Ampeno?
That's me.
"You texted me first, it's unlike you."
Romli your left ear-
I mean your right ear.
What?
You right ear. Speak for yourself! You're not even sitting down yet.
Where did you come from, Can?
I had a date with Poppy.
Yas' daughter?
I think so. She's a relative from my father's side.
That's good!
She's from Minang, and a relative from your father's side.
Go for her!
It was only a date, I don't know what will happen next.
Uncle... Wait...
Listen, I was too old when I got married.
My kids are still in elementary school, but now I'm fifty one already.
She's pretty, right?
Well...
What about Daeng?
Don't be like him.
Single geezer!
Geezer!
Gosh!
Did you just wake up or get home?
I just got home.
Come sit down with me!
Can...
Did you go out with Poppy? Yas told me.
I did, but there was nothing special.
But, Poppy is pretty, right?
Yeah, not bad...
for Jatinegara.
Not bad, but she suits you, right?
Mom. Mom, it was only a date.
We haven't done anything.
We haven't done anything. Oh dear, what are you looking for?
I don't want you to choose the wrong wife.
Marriage is only once for a lifetime.
That's why you should stop pestering me.
What if I choose the wrong person? What if I get divorced?
Another excuse.
Alright then, I'm going to pray now.
I'm off.
Bye.
Call me later.
Catch up?
You go first. Shut it!
Are you going for a run?
Yeah.
You like to work out, huh?
I do.
I don't want a fat belly and bald head when I'm forty.
You take after your father.
Your father wanted to be an athlete,
but he just stopped.
Riddle me this.
What tree is the bravest?
Durian tree.
Wrong answer, you go run first.
Just answer it later.
Okay then, bye...
Come to my house before you leave for work.
Okay.
Hey, Can!
People are busy going to work and you're still running.
Keep up the good work, Mas Ucup!
Help!
Help! My grandpa!
What's wrong with my grandpa?
Why?
Please help my grandpa.
What happened to your grandpa?
Mr. Giran passed away! Mr. Giran!
Mr. Giran? Yes
We were just chatting.
He went to bed and didn't wake up.
He asked me to wake him up at nine, I woke him up
He asked me to wake him up at nine, I woke him up but he had already passed away.
Please help.
Can...
You met Mr. Giran?
I did, we talked over there, he was healthy.
He's dead now.
How horrifying!
When death comes,
no one knows.
That's why you should get married soon.
Only God knows a man's destiny.
Nobody knows on which part of Earth they will die.
Where are you going?
I'm going to the office.
Keep running away, Can!
Run away from your mom!
You never listen to me or obey what I say.
Your late father always told you to obey what the parents say.
I don't want to die before my son gets married!
Hello.

Thank you, but we need to deliver stuff to the others, Ma'am.
One more thing, please find me the smart one.
And if it's possible, a pretty one who understands religion.
Okay, what religion?
Islam.
Okay, is there more?
That's it.
If there's anything, I'll contact you.
Thank you, good evening.
Miss!
Yes?
If possible, find me a true Padangnese girl.
Okay, anything else?
That's it, Miss.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Is this Indra Tauhid's house?
That's right.
My name is Arini.
Arini Chaniago, his friend in college.
He said you have a pavilion for rent here?
Yes, please come in!
Come on, please!
So you have known Ican for long?
We've known each other for a long time.
We were once close.
We went out, more or less.
You two dated?
Praise be to God!
Can you speak Minang?
Not too fluent, but I understand it.
My father is Bugis, my mother is Minang
I often hear my mother speaks in Minang language.
Mom. Can...
Ican!
Can.
You never say you had a girlfriend in Bandung.
Come on! Sit here.
How are you?
What about your mom? Is she well?
So, you've met her mother?
My mother used to visit me in Bandung. Ican met her once or twice.
She calls me Upiak at home!
Upiak?
Mom! I'm hungry.
Go eat first.
Let me accompany you.
Later when you're done eating, take her to the pavilion next to yours.
The room is empty.
I have a work training around East Jakarta.
Okay, I'll take you there after dinner.
Sure!
You picked a good one!
You know your job, right?
Actually what you did at my home earlier was right.
So, these elders keep interfering my dating life, marriage, women and all.
Your job is just to make them all calm.
Okay, are there more specific things I need to know?
My mom is Padangnese from flesh to blood.
But I believe you can adjust yourself to it.
This is your pavilion, this is the key.
If there is anything, I live here.
Upiak!
Hey, Upiak Arini!
Who's that?
She used to be close to Ican when he studied in Bandung.
Now she moved to Makassar, but her mother is from Minang.
Ma'am.
Where are you going in the morning?
I'm heading to the training place, they provide breakfast,
and the training starts at ten.
If that's the case, then let's go home, and have breakfast at home!
But...
Come on, let's enjoy the meal of our people!
Come on! Join our breakfast.
My eldest son Ndoy, used to obey me.
He wanted to study at UIN majoring in Tarbiyah, but before the exam,
he had a fever!
When he was little,
When he was little, he often went out of town with me
if his father could not take him there...
Until that woman came!
I feel like I'm losing my child!
Ndoy didn't do anything wrong, Ma'am. How come it's Maya's fault?
She manipulates Ndoy so he won't listen to me anymore!
How about Ican?
Ican is a rebel.
Being a civil servant is better than his current work now.
But he prefers wearing jeans to work like poor people.
But Ican is a good person.
As I remember, he's understanding and responsible.
Do you still like him?
Assalamualaikum.
Waalaikumussalam.
Come on Arini, we're going to the market!
To cook breakfast, I'm looking for ingredients.
You work in the afternoon, right?
Yes. Come on!
Yeah just a minute, I'll brush my teeth first.
Pretty girls never smell bad! Come on let's go! Okay?
Okay. Can.
Ican!
Thanks.
You're having breakfast?
Yes.
Your dad still works on film shoots?
I think he's working on a shoot right now.
Oh yeah?
If he needs an actor or anything, tell him to contact me.
Okay.
Daeng, I brought this food.
Mrs.Ros, let me help you with it.
Give it to Daeng. Okay.
Mrs. Ros brings a girl! Mrs. Ros brings a pretty girl!
Mrs. Ros brings a girl! Mrs. Ros brings a pretty girl! Who's the girl?
Assalamualaikum.
Waalaikumsalam.
Daeng. Let me introduce you.
This is Ibrahim from Makassar too,
This is Ibrahim from Makassar too, but he has lived in Jakarta for a long time.
My late husband's best friend.
We're good friends until now.
Pretty lady!
Come sit down.
Let me introduce you...
Surya.
I'm Romli.
Syarip.
Ipeh! Just call me Ipeh.
Cut it out, I’m not Syarip!
We have a reason to call you Syarip, kooky!
Ican was Arini's close friend.
She's his future wife?
They were dating in Bandung.
Old love is blooming again.
That's true!
What are you guys saying?
Hi.
Indra Tauhid. Via.
Hey, come here, will you?
Come here!
It's not often that we get to see you here.
Yeah, I'm on a diet.
Are you going to marry that girl?
She was my old friend, we just met again.
Old friends can be your leap towards something else.
True!
Is she pretty?
She's pretty, her mom must be pretty too.
Your turn.
But, I agree she is pretty
You better make your mom happy.
That's even better!
I personally approve that Chaniago girl!
Anyway...
Go for it!
Go for it!
You'll be happy.
I'll just go home.
Why?
Now, you're all like my mom.
Can...
Can! You and your loud mouth!
You and your loud mouth!
Excuse me...
Your turn, my face hurts.
If only I had a daughter like you, Arini...
Diligent, kind, religious.
I only have sons, you should be my daughter-in-law.
Can...
Where are you going this early?
What are you doing? You're playing with trash at this hour.
I was told to take some days off.
But I don't know until when.
Domino tonight?
You took the medicine?
I did.
If you're still not feeling well, go see a doctor.
Hey, Ican! Let's have breakfast first.
I'm still full. Where's your plus one?
I'm heading to the office.
I'm off. Where are you going?
I'll go in.
Iron the suit, okay?
Do not leave any wrinkle!
Is that Buncun?
Cun...
Buncun...
Hey! Buncun!
Why the long face?
Are you sick?
What's the problem again?
Are you sick? Drink this.
Drink this.
What happened to you?
What happened? Tell us.
Endah wants us to split, Daeng.
Lailahaillallah...
It's either me or them who shall leave the house.
Drugs, huh? Are you doing drugs?
Are you doing drugs? Admit it!
Are you doing drugs?
No...
Work?
Its been six months since I stopped.
They found out about my drug habit.
That's it, you'll make your mom sad again! Come on, I'll take you there.
You guys man the place, I'll help him first.
You're making it hard for your mom!
What else do you bring to this house, Son?
Divorce story?
Oh my God.
Is it still the same problem?
Pray!
Choose the right path!
Return to Allah.
Live well.
Take it, Ros. Use this.
Ma'am. Ma'am, where do you want this food?
Let me take care of it, I'll eat it inside.
What happened to you, Ma'am?
Have you met Yunus? He's Ican's little brother.
Ican often told me about you.
He said you're his dearest little brother.
Come on in, let's eat this together, this looks so delicious...
Where's Mom?
She's in the mosque.
What happened?
They say Endah left you, huh?
If only you followed Dad's words.
Being a good student.
Graduating and working as an honorary staff.
Everything's settled!
You would've lived a good life now.
I'm not you, we're different. I don't like being compared to you.
Then who else?
Ican?
Ican didn't study here.
He is used to being far from our parents.
What about yourself?
You were Dad's dearest son, his hope...
Just follow his words, live peacefully! Live well! Okay?
I understand about Burhan, Endah or whoever.
Didn't I say to you? if there's anything, tell me I will definitely help!
Ican is also like that.
We're brothers!
No matter how different we are, we're still siblings.
We will not go anywhere.
So, where have you been looking?
Everybody says they don't know where they are.
It's been three days.
I'm so frustrated.
Have you talked to him?
I was just talking to him.
Family must be together at any cost.
Listen to that.
I would be embarrassed if you get divorced.
I'll lose my face in front of the family.
Our family in Padang must be talking about me.
What it would make me if my child gets divorced?
Did you buy it?
Yes, would you like to try some?
Good for you, it's not your wife's cooking.
You can also eat my food.
I told you, she uses you so her child would have a father.
Why are you taking it out on me?
If your wife was a little bit better,
you would've had a better luck.
God, what did I do?
The little one wants a divorce.
The oldest one has a troublesome wife.
And my second child...
Ican...
Is he at the office?
I don't know.
Please give him an advice.
Tell him to get married, to get a girlfriend and have a stable life.
Why don't you just say that yourself directly?
I want to call him.
How do I use this? Turn it on please.
Let's think about it, what if we barter it?
Barter?
Hold on a sec.
Barter?
We can do that, but...
I have to ask the cast whether he agrees or not.
Let's have another meeting, shall we? To discuss...
I'm really sorry I'm late.
This is a package for you.
Yes, thank you. Okay.
We can talk about it, what do you think?
Sure. How is it?
We haven't got the budget yet.
We can't cut the cameras anyway.
He didn't pick it up!
Maybe he's having lunch.
It's like water...
On a taro leaves...
Come on sing!
Smile please.
Everything will be alright.
Come on sing!
What's with that face?
So gloomy.
It's your brother.
His wife left him, that's why he looks all gloomy.
You should get married soon! You'll make it easier for us.
I'm the one to blame again!
It's on you, you know.
It's on you, you know. You married the wrong woman.
And this one is so reckless when it comes to sex.
Me? He was Dad's favorite, a civil servant just like him.
Why am I the wrong one?
You're both married, but it doesn't change anything.
You live a complicated life and you're not even married.
Just get married for real then!
Upiak!
Mom.
We have a single geezer here.
Can.
Try to think about ways to make your life more meaningful.
But don't choose the wrong wife like your brother.
Why are you taking it out on me, mom?
Looking for the right wife to please you is really hard.
Now you're talking back!
Don't you remember what your religion taught you?
Go pray, so you remember God!
Say the syahadat again later, I'm gonna be your company!
You shall pray...
Hey!
Why are you laughing?
Do you think I'm joking? This is no joke!
And you shouldn't get divorced!
Listen to her.
Assalamualaikum.
Waalaikumsalam.
Arini, have you finished your training?
Yes, Ma'am.
I brought durian for you, Ican, and Buncun.
What about me? They don't need it, give them all to me.
They don't need it, give them all to me.
Start from tonight, you will sleep here.
Arini will sleep in the front room.
Okay?
Let's go to your room.
But that's my room, Mom.
You guys can stay here.
Upiak will stay with me.
Who's that?
Where does she live?
Where are you going? Help me! You lazy bum!
What? I just need to take something. Don't overreact, I need help too.
Assalamualaikum.
Waalaikumsalam. Please come in, Maya.
What happened, Mom?
This soap opera is so sad.
The daughter-in-law really loves her mother in-law, it made me sad.
Something smells really good, are you cooking?
No, it's Upiak who's cooking. Smells good, huh?
Bang Jaja's goat soap is losing its spell.
Don't worry, I'll finish it later.
Ma'am, what should I do with...
You're Ndoy's wife, right?
You haven't met her, have you?
Not yet.
She is Ican's sister in-law, let me introduce you.
Arini. Maya.
It's good to see you two get along well.
Well, cooking is the most fun when it is done together.
Help me! Seasoning is also okay.
How far along are you now?
It's the eighth month.
Please be careful if you want to cook.
Come on!
I have never seen your mother as happy as now.
I can really feel her happiness.
Look at her aura!
It shines!
Very positive.
Her beauty is back to the way it was, really beautiful
Why are you bringing up her looks?
What happened in the past?
To be honest...
Well...
Your mother is actually my true love.
You want to laugh, right? Huh?
You wanna hear the story? Just tell me then.
So...
The first time I met your mother, I immediately fell in love.
But...
I don't know why I hesitated I was afraid to express my love.
Kids nowadays call it confessing, right?
- Confessing. - Yeah.
I was hesitant to confess to her.
And the funny thing was that your father
And the funny thing was that your father secretly fell in love with your mother too.
That was a huge dilemma!
I remember that very well.
Your mother, your father, and me
went to eat at one of the meatball stalls in Salemba.
I was so determined.
I was determined to confess after we finished eating.
I was so determined!
But you know what?
Amazingly, your father!
He confessed when your mom was still eating!
In front of me!
So dramatic!
I wanted to be angry, but he was my friend.
Then they were together, got married, and everything.
I let it go because we were friends.
So your father and your mother were very nice people.
Your mom is very kind.
She is willing to do everything for her sons.
Anything!
I think...
I think, it's not difficult to make your mother happy even though she's that fussy.
I think, it's not difficult to make your mother happy even though she's that fussy. You'll find a way if you really want it.
So...
I beg you.
Please...
Please make your mother happy.
Because that is your duty as a child.
For your father...
And for me...
Promise me.
This is our secret.
Are you done talking? Come on let's play.
Let's go! Shuffle the card.
I was so close to my victory.
What can we say, huh?
He's an elder...
Let's go.
This song...
Just like water
On taro leaves
Floating above
Leaving no marks
Ican...
Bun...
Ah, you're home!
What song do you want? I'll do it for you!
Keep your words!
I want a song from Lamb of God. What the...
I give up, please pick something slow.
People will come here to complain.
Assalamualaikum.
Waalaikumsalam. Someone's here to pick me up.
Sorry for coming late, Zulaikha wanted to play.
It's okay, Juleha come here!
Who's Juleha, Mom?
It's the same.
Mom, we're going home. Rest well.
Everyone, we're going home.
That's unlike her.
Please sing something seriously this time.
We can do it.
Let's sing with me.
I'm going back to the pavilion.
Don't you want to sing?
Ready?
Just like water...
Ma'am...
I'm okay.
I'm just reminiscing about my kids.
And... their childhood dreams.
Ma'am...
What was Ican's dream?
He wanted to be a president.
I just want him to be happy.
His dad loved him so much.
His dad used to give him everything he wanted.
Now he turned out like that...
He's influenced by so many things now.
Mom...
It's a rare sight to see you stop by before going to the office in the morning.
Yes, I want to go together with Arini.
I see.
Can.
Mom, we're going.
See you.
Take care.
I know you two are close, but don't commit adultery.
Mom, please!
Where are we going now?
The scenario is I'm going to a "training".
You're right.
Do you want to eat?
Well, sure.
The stalls down there?
Okay.
I think there are a lot of delicious food down there.
Shall we? Let's go.
Hey, you're walking together, but you aren't holding hands.
Like the proverbs...
Swimming with boots!
It's heavy!
We aren't mahram.
Mahram?
You better take a shower with hot water if you don't want to catch a cold!
Supiak Arini!
You went somewhere? I just finished my training.
How was the training?
Praise be to God it was good, it's just typical training.
Tell Mrs. Ros I said hi.
I will.
"I prepared your favorite food, Upiak. Please enjoy it, dear."
Will you still love my mom...
when your contract ends?
Will you be like this forever?
Will you still love your family?
Now you two are close again.
You still like each other, right?
Right?
I think you better have an unofficial wedding first!
Supiak...
Do you have any relatives in Jakarta?
I have an uncle.
He owns the most delicious Padang rice stall in Jakarta.
Located on Benhil.
Why don't you meet my uncle first?
Praise be to God.
So we can go there?
We can do that, can't we?
Sure, we can.
Is this the place?
You can sit here, Ma'am.
Arini, how are you?
Praise be to God, I'm well.
It's been awhile and you look prettier.
Is uncle Afadal here?
He didn't come.
Is he not feeling well?
I don't know, there's no news either.
What do you want to drink?
Orange juice please.
Please sit down.
She speaks Minangkabau?
Well...
She's a Minang girl after all...
Smooth.
Wow, it looks really good, I'm really hungry.
This is the most delicious one.
Intestine curry.
I see.
You first...
I'm hungry.
This restaurant belongs to your uncle? Yes.
He is from Solok, he's been living here for a long time.
Has he got a branch?
Mom, let's eat first.
We can talk after enjoying the meals.
Are you hungry?
Okay, let's dig in.
Hello, what the...?
Bun! Don't even bother coming to the court, you're gonna delay the process.
What are you talking about?
Don't take my child with you!
Just go alone!
Why are you yelling at me? I'm just...
You piece of shit!
Buncun! Calm down...
It was Endah...
I can't take this pain
I can't take this pain anymore
I can't take this pain
I can't take this pain anymore
I can't take it anymore
It's hard to find a wife who wants to see her husband gets wasted every day.
I don't want it too.
But you're my son, there's no way I could disown you.
I've been clean for three months.
I do it for my child.
But she doesn't believe it.
Can...
Can, come here.
Okay, Mom.
Sit here.
When you we're still a kid,
you used to say you wanted to be a president.
Now...
Now I don't even understand what your job is.
You don't listen to me...
and do as you please.
But maybe...
Allah gave you that job.
Are you happy with your life?
I will pray for you.
My dearest sons.
Ma'am.
Are you sad, Ma'am?
No.
My eyes...
Something got in my eyes.
Are you sure, Ma'am?
I'm fine.
I will be able to laugh again soon.
Ma'am.
If I could choose...
I really want to have a mother like you.
A mother who loves her children,
understands religion,
cares for everyone.
What about your mother?
My mom...
My mom is just an ordinary person.
She used to sell clothes, but now she runs a tailor at home.
I am also an ordinary person.
But you're different.
Someone is trying to find a way to be my daughter-in-law.
Don't tease me.
Am I right?
I wish that we have the same timing.
This is Ndoy's house.
Assalamualaikum.
How come this tree is so big now?
Gosh, everything's so lush.
It was still small before.
I'm so speechless!
You're spacing out!
Waalaikumsalam.
Arini...
The last time you came here was when I just bought this house.
Nathan was still a baby.
Now he is in kindergarten.
Wait...
Maya! Mom is here!
Come in.
Please sit here, Mom.
You want me to sit here like I'm your guest?
Mom?
Maya.
Arini is here too.
I'll take Nathan upstairs.
What a surprise, we didn't prepare anything for you.
Take it easy, Arini will cook later.
But we don't have the ingredients.
We don't have the ingredients. Let's just order the food.
No, I don't want to. I want freshly cooked meals!
Maya, just sit down.
May I please use your kitchen for a bit?
Yes, sure. You can just leave your bag here.
It's okay, I have ingredients from Madagascar.
You plan to deliver your baby naturally dont you?
Maya please come to my house next week.
I'll cook something for you, we'll have dinner together! Okay?
Mom...
I can't find any ingredients in the kitchen.
There's only instant noodles with eggs.
What if we buy food outside?
We'll do as you say.
Look at you listening to her.
She said there's no food!
Okay, I'll prepare the drinks first.
It's alright, please let me do it.
Thanks, the glasses are above the plate drawer.
This one?
Yes.
Please make sure you come next week, okay?
I'll prepare a special dinner for my family.
Mom.
Ican.
You're picking up your soon to be wife, huh?
Not so soon.
Upiak! Ican is here.
Okay.
See you.
Be careful.
Let's have lunch at home later.
My mom looks happy.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you for what?
I've never seen her like this before.
Well...
I probably have.
But it was a long time ago.
Let's go to Makassar.
Sure. When?
Now!
Come on! How about we take the bus to Makassar?
As soon as possible.
Okay.
I love you.
If you love me...
I have no reason not to love you back.
Don't take my child!
I didn't even cheat on you!
You know that well! It's hard enough for me to get hard because of the drugs.
Shut it!
You shut up!
I've done everything for you and my child!
Now you want to ditch me just like that?
You sick witch!
Now screw off! Go away!
Yunus Tauhid Sikumbang!
Watch what you say!
I never raised you to speak like that!
There's no force strong enough to change the fact that you are my child!
All of you.
Anandoyo Tauhid Sikumbang, Indra Tauhid Sikumbang.
Let her go!
As a mother, it's her right to take that child with her.
Mom...
Ndoy...
Ican...
This is my goodbye.
I don't want to cause a scene.
Bun...
You are Burhan's father.
You can meet him when the time comes.
Screw off!
Screw off! Just screw off!
Assalamualaikum.
Be strong, Mom.
Ndoy.
Please stay here.
Well, if there's anything, just tell me, my house is near.
Be strong, Bun...
Your house is near just like you said, just around the mosque, right?
You're right.
Upiak! Come to the kitchen, help me cooking.
Don't let this fuss mess up our dinner.
Come here! Okay.
Why the hell are you making your mom sad?
Failure is nothing to be ashamed about, you can take lessons from it.
That's just life!
It's like sailing...
in the ocean.
Then there's a big storm!
You just have to turn around!
Start a new life!
Keep that in your mind!
What is your real name?
Arini Chaniago.
Really?
How...
How did you end up with this job?
Why do you want to do it?
I like to see other people happy.
I like seeing other people feel happy.
It's the same with you making me happy now.
Arini!
Where are you going this early?
I have to go, Mrs. Nurma, we have an early schedule today.
Please watch over Ican and his mother.
Is the door locked yet?
It is, come on!
It's hard to start...
Hey!
Where are you going this early?
You're not going to pray?
I'm in a hurry.
Surya, Romli...
Please watch over Ican and his mother.
They are good people.
We will...
Why the hell she said it like it was a will?
Ican... Mom...
Her room has been empty since this morning.
Where did she go?
I don't know.
She didn't pick up my calls either.
Assalamualaikum.
Waalaikumsalam.
Who's turn is the recitation tomorrow?
We'll do it in Mrs. Salim's house, we've done it here three times.
That's good news.
I met Supiak this morning.
Really?
She went to her office early in the morning.
She told me...
to watch over you two.
Ma'am.
Since we can't contact Mrs. Hasan, what about the arisan money?
It's okay, that's fine.
Mom, I'm going.
Take care.
He's here this early?
He wanted to say goodbye.
He's a good boy.
Where is Supiak?
I bet she's in her office.
She has a life, unlike me.
A dirty and unshowered young man
having lunch with his mother.
That's not what I meant, she didn't answer my calls.
You should eat with me.
I will find her later.
Find her where?
Well, I'll try.
"Supiak Arini hasn't come home yet, where could she be now?"
Hello, Mom.
-Have you called your girlfriend?
Not yet. -Call her.
-What's up with you two?
-You had a fight?
-Fix it.
What are you cooking?
What are you cooking? It's a simple recipe.
Come here, Mom.
We have stir-fried shrimp and chicken.
Buncun, we have stir-fried shrimp.
Where can I put it?
Thanks, Nathan.
Today is Mother's Day.
Today is Mother's Day. So, just sit down and we'll take care of everything.
Thank you, my child.
Don't mention it, Mom. These are our duties to make our parents happy.
I hope you continue to be happy.
Like me and your dad.
Like me and your dad. Loving each other till we're old and gray.
And finally until one of us had to leave.
Amen.
Let's eat.
Gosh, the water broke!
Please call Daeng Ibrahim.
Help me! Hurry up and help!
What about mopping the water? Where's the mop? The cloth!
The foods are tasty, right?
It's divine!
My name is Afadal, the owner of this place.
I heard you've tried to see me in person?
My nephew is your niece's friend.
Really? Which one?
Her name is Arini.
Arini! I see...
She's not my immediate niece, I know Arini Chaniago from Bukittinggi.
She learned to cook Minangkabau cuisine.
She said it takes ages to cook them.
This one, sir?
Yes, that one!
Enjoy your meals!
Ladies, on this occasion I ask you to pray for the health
Ladies, on this occasion I ask you to pray for the health of my fourth grandchild.
Maryam Fatimah Tauhid.
The third daughter of my children. Anandoyo Tauhid and Maya Setia Hariyanti.
I also ask you to pray for our child,
Arini Chaniago,
who's somewhere out there now,
so that she will stay healthy and live happily.
Let's recite al-Fatihah.
When it has to be over...
it's not your fault...
my fault or our fault...
But it's the timing that is not on our side.
Is Mr. Richard coming back, sir?
He said this week.
Three days ago he said that he arrived in the city with lots of durians and elephants.
Where's that?
Many durians and elephants!
Palembang? Lampung? Lampung!
Lampung...
Finally...
Mr. Samsul, we're off.
Your batik looks dapper!
Thanks, we'll go home, Sir.
Mr. Richard is enjoying his life for real, going on a lot of trips.
I didn't even realize it's been three years.
He always stayed here all his life before.
Since he was a kid?
Since he was born.
Jak! Why did you close it?
Shh! Keep it down will ya?
Swap the eggs quick!
I'm starving!
Hurry! Hurry!
Ok! Job’s done!
Let's move!
Out of my way, BoBoiBoy!
Watch where you’re going.
Huh? What’s that you’ve got there?
What else? It's my breakfast!
Huh?! You're not supposed to take one of the eggs Gopal! Why not?
Let’s make an omelet. Want some?
Sheesh... What is wrong with you?
Put it back Gopal! Now!
Hey! Lay off! You're not getting a single bite of it then!
Mama's not home! She’s gone to work!
This is all your fault, Gopal!
My fault? I was just hungry!
You're so full of excuses!
I don't wanna die BoBoiBoy!
Elemental Power!
BoBoiBoy Ice!
Ice Slide!
Amma! Appa! Help!
Well done, BoBoiBoy...
You do all the heavy lifting for me...
and we'll gladly swoop in to grab the prize!
Let's go, Probe! Transform now!
Aye aye, Mister Boss!
Mode: Probey Copta!
We've lost her!
Look out, BoBoiBoy!
Pizza Transformation!
She’s looking for us.
Please don't find me...
Please don't find me...
-Ow! Ow! Ow!
-Ow! Stop pecking me! -Hey!
Don't go out there, Gopal!
How was work, Mama?
Calm down, Mama!
Gopal! Get back inside!
Help me!
We got him, Probe! Let's go!
Okay, Mister Boss!
What are you waiting for?
Help me out here, BoBoiBoy!
You guys go help out Gopal!
I'll go save EggaBot.
BoBoiBoy Thunderstorm!
Gravity Lift!
-Let go of me! -Be quiet, will you?
Mister Boss! We're almost there!
Farewell, BoBoiBoy!
See you never again, ex-buddy!
Hit the brakes, Probe! Now!
You may be able to run and escape from your ex...
However!
You cannot escape from Justice!
Ochobot!
Okay!
Huh? What are you trying to do? Open a zoo?
Do kids like Mister Boss get a free entry?
Super Speed!
Hey, hey! That power sphera belongs to me!
Is that what you think?
Attack!
That hurts! Hey! No biting!
Please stop hurting me, Mister Gorilla!
Please don't hurt us anymore...
We won't do it again!
You don't have to worry about me.
But... I don’t know about BoBoiBoy.
BoBoiBoy?
-Take this! -Uh oh!
Thunderstorm Slash!
No!
Gopal, are you okay?
I'm okay...
Thanks, Yaya...
Mama! Mama!
Mama!
Baby!
Ma-
Ow that hurts. Huh?
That's a nice cushion you’ve got there Mister Boss.
Where did you get it?
EggaBot's safe and sound.
Let's get out of here!
Captain Papa, everyone's on board.
Ow! Ow! That hurts!
Oh, my back!
I wouldn't want to be in their place.
What are you waiting for? Let's go BoBoiBoy!
-Help! Somebody help! -You bring Gopal inside.
-Where are you going?!
-I can't just leave Adu Du and Probe like that!
Elemental Power!
BoBoiBoy Triple Split!
SECTOR Z55-2P SOLARIA GALAXY
Get ready everyone!
Move it, slowpokes!
We don't have time to waste!
Secure the perimeter! Set up the charges.
Ready, Boss!
Grab as much as you can.
Hey! Fill up the cargo!
-Okay, Boss! -Move it, move it!
We're going to be rich!
We are running out of time.
Boss! Take a look at this!
What is it?
There’s someone inside?
100 YEARS AGO
Stop hiding behind your shield and face me coward!
I’ll show you!
Take this!
Crystal...
-Trident!
You’re not going anywhere!
Crystal Prison!
Stop!
I will be taking your elemental powers!
Gamma Blast!
No!
Good work!
Yet another Power Sphera has been acquired safely!
Thank you, Commander!
I wouldn't call that safely. What?!
BoBoiBoy saved Adu Du and Probe again.
Watch this!
That was not a wise move BoBoiBoy.
You could have jeopardized the mission.
BoBoiBoy should just stick to the mission plan
-instead of wasting time on saving Adu Du. -What is all this fuss about, Cadets?!
Admiral!
It's nothing, Admiral Tarung!
Nothing?!
BoBoiBoy jeopardized the mission again! He rescued Adu Du and Probe!
What?!
But...
We still rescued the Power Sphera EggaBot!
That's right, Admiral!
BoBoiBoy and friends have successfully rescued all the Power Spheras in every mission they’ve been given.
To date BoBoiBoy's team is the highest achieving team in TAPOPS.
Admirable.
Good work BoBoiBoy and team!
Looking at all your previous achievements, the leave you have all been applying for has been...
Approved!
-Congratulations! -Yay! We're going back home!
Yay! I was getting sick of looking at the Admiral's face!
What did you say?!
It's nothing, sir!
How much did we get?
About half a ton, sir!
What? That comet is only accessible once a century...
but we only brought in half a ton of crystals?!
We shouldn’t have saved that guy in the crystal!
Are you referring to me?
How the...
How did he get out of the crystal?
What is this place?
Wh-who- who are you?!
Retak'ka.
And who might you be?
I’ll ask again.
Who are you?!
We are just crystal miners!
I still have remnants of this power?
Retak'ka?
The Retak’ka?
The legendary master of the elemental powers!
Huh? Master of the Elemental Powers?
But I thought...
The Elemental Powers belong to that kid named BoBoiBoy?
Yeah! That superhero kid from TAPOPS right?!
Explain yourself!
Who is BoBoiBoy and TAPOPS?
They are... The protectors of Power Spheras! What? Power spheras you say?
You will take me to them!
Why should I listen to you?!
I give you two reasons.
For the sake of your safety...
And... for you to harvest even more crystals...
Even more... crystals?
Good evening, Mister Boss!
How are you feeling today?
Ow! Ow ow ow!
Take it easy will you?
Oh please, Mister Boss...
It’s just a little bump on your head.
And a little Penguin smackdown.
Stop being so dramatic.
Hey! Easy for you to say!
You're just a robot! You don't feel any pain!
Well excuse me. Robots do feel pain, you know?
What do you mean?
My heart is in pain working for a boss like you.
Ow!
This is not the time to be making ridiculous jokes!
Go out and find BoBoiBoy's location!
Oh, okay okay.
This old alien’s never going to learn.
What did you say?!
Nothing!
I said, Mister Boss, don't forget to eat your medicines.
Finally... we have arrived on Earth.
I can smell Amma's curry from here!
Oh! They’re finally here!
My beloved son is finally home!
Tok Aba!
BoBoiBoy!
-Mom! -Mama!
-Yaya! -Ying!
My dear boy! How I’ve missed you so- Huh?
I'm coming for you, Amma's curry!
Hey! Why you! Stop right there! Hey! Come back here! You ungrateful child! -Wait for me! Amma's curry!
That's Gopal for you.
He went straight back home
Awesome…
How are you, Tok?
Hmm, I'm fine…
I can't believe it's been 3 months. I’ve missed you so much, BoBoiBoy.
I’ve really missed you too, Tok.
Papa is home!
Huh? Where are my honey pumpkins of justice?
Yay Papa! You’re home!
Pipi!
Papa!
Oh my little girl!
-I've missed you so much! -Papa! Papa!
How many evil aliens have you beaten?
How many Power Spheras have you saved?
Tell me, Papa! Tell me everything!
It's nothing much...
I'll say... around twelve to thirteen dozens!
What a bald-faced lie...
A dozen equals twelve...
Twelve to thirteen dozens...
Wow!
One hundred forty four to one hundred fifty six?!
That's a lot!
-You're amazing, Papa! -Oh dear...
You're a clever one aren't you?
Who taught you that?
You did, of course.
When I grow up, I wanna be just like Papa!
I am Pipi Zola!
Daughter of Justice!
Cousin to Cuteness!
Aww, just look at her!
Hey, Justice can be adorable too.
Watch this.
I am Papa Zola!
Lovable enemy of evil!
Adorable ally of-
-I'm going to throw up! -Come on girls. Let's go home!
Hey hey, wait up! You haven't seen half of my cuteness yet!
Come now, Papa. Let's go home. You must be really tired right?
You must be really tired right?
You are absolutely right my darling.
Let us go home!
Alright. Come and help me close up shop early.
-We have so much to talk about tonight. -Sure thing Tok Aba.
Huh? Fang?
Fang! Are you coming with us or not?
I don't think so. I have to guard the spaceship.
EggaBot is still under our protection.
Relax, there's nothing to worry about.
It's safe here.
Yeah! This spaceship has state-of-the-art defenses anyway!
Yeah! This spaceship has state-of-the-art defenses anyway! Come on, Fang.
Well... If you're not gonna sleep over at my place,
who's going to finish all of the carrot soup I made?
Carrot soup?!
Wait up, Tok Aba!
I’ll go get my things now!
Caught a big fish at night.
Gonna cook it in curry tonight.
Here you go Fang. One carrot soup just for you.
Woah, I love carrot soup.
Coming through! Piping hot! Piping hot!
Tok Aba's special chicken curry is ready!
Woah! The curry smells so good!
Compliments to the chef of course.
You didn’t have to cook so much Tok Aba!
Of course I had to. You've been away for so long.
I’m sure you’ve missed my cooking am I right?
Got that right Tok Aba!
I haven't eaten anything this good in three months!
Now the table is set and dinner is served.
What are you waiting for BoBoiBoy? Start talking.
What do you want to hear about, Tok Aba?
Why, tell me all about your TAPOPS missions of course. What else?
I don't think there's much to talk about.
Nothing much?
BoBoiBoy has saved countless Power Spheras!
Isn't that right, Fang?
I guess. But he doesn't stop at saving Power Spheras.
He even saves the bad guys while he's at it.
-What! You saved the bad guys? -Yeah, Tok Aba!
Can you believe he saved Adu Du again?!
Oh, Adu Du. It’s fine. That alien boy isn't so bad.
You got that right!
He's nothing more than a troublemaker!
Gopal?
How did you-
Easy peasy.
Where there is curry...
There Gopal will be!
As usual... Always quick with a quip.
So, uh, have a seat! Come, come!
Make yourselves at home!
Hey! You took the entire fish?!
You want me to throw you out?
Please don't, Tok Aba! Who's going to finish all this food?
-A little bit higher. Higher. -Here?
Ah... That’s the spot.
Papa, what are you looking at?
Just looking at these mission photos.
Wow! You're so cool, Papa!
Don’t you ever get scared?
Everyone knows, Justice is afraid of no one!
Woah! I wanna be just like Papa!
I am Pipi Zola!
Protector of Power Spheras!
Oh dear... You're gonna break my back!
Bring me along next time, Papa.
I’ll help you beat up those evil aliens!
Ow, ow, ow ow ow! Let go of me!
The back of Justice...
Papa?
Yes, Pipi?
Why are your eyes so big?
Hey, do you need glasses?
Can I see a Power Sphera, please?
Ha-ha! Look all you want!
I don’t mean here. I wanna see it with my own eyes.
Please say yes.
Here you go, here! Close enough for your eyes?
That's not funny!
And I thought your eyes were big,
your teeth are even bigger!
Alright, alright. We'll go in the morning okay?
Yay! Promise, okay? Take me there tomorrow.
Okay! Like I always say...
Justice... never breaks any promises!
I'm in, Probe!
Upload the ninja programme immediately.
On it, Mister Boss!
Ninja programme, uploaded and ready!
That was too easy.
I have a visual on the Power Sphera vault.
Not even ninjas can get through!
Find another route, Probe!
Oh, we don't have to, Mister Boss!
Switching to, Manual Control!
Get ready...
Onwards!
Hold up Probe! Stop!
Ow... You actually rolled me up into a ball!
It’s like they say, better be safe and round!
It’s safe and sound not round!
EggaBot?!
Excellent... At long last. This priceless Power Sphera will finally be mine! Huh?!
At long last. This priceless Power Sphera will finally be mine! Huh?!
Wow!
Adu Du?!
What are you doing here?!
Oh no!
What? Probe is here too?
Huh? Who is this little girl?
I am Pipi Zola!
Enemy of evil,
daughter of Justice!
Huh? Pipi Zola?
Yeah! Pipi!
Putri
Intan
Payung
Indah!
Zola!
Zulaikha
Odelia
Ladasyia
Absyari!
Wow, that's such a long name!
Must be hard to fill up school forms.
Don't have to, Papa does it for me.
That's right... It is now... too late for regrets...
Hey, hey! Stop being friendly with them, Probe!
Get them now- Huh?!
Where did they go?!
Where is EggaBot?!
Come on, you. Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Stop right there!
See you later invader!
Let’s get out of here, Pipi!
Where you think you’re going, huh?!
Come back here!
Papa?
Why are you screaming like that?
Huh? Uh, what I mean to say is...
-Please help this macho man! -Stop!
Don't run!
Drat! Probe! Activate Chaser Mode!
Okay, Mister Boss!
Chaser Mode on!
Huh?
Swim Mode?
You're done for!
Why am I swimming on the floor?!
Uh oh! Sorry, Mister Boss!
But you're going pretty fast!
Just keep swimming, Mister Boss!
Faster! Backstroke!
-Hey! What are you doing? -Breaststroke!
Dolphin leap!
Wow! Adu Dulphin!
Activate EggaBot now my little one!
Get inside!
Hey, hey! Stop!
Get out of there!
How do I do this?
Scanning identity.
Calibrating size.
Yay! I've got it!
Activation complete.
Welcome. Please insert your name.
Um... Putri...
-Intan... -Don’t you dare activate EggaBot!
Ow! That hurts!
What’s taking you so long in there, Pipi?
This is your fault, Papa!
You’re the one who gave me such a long name!
Take this!
Don't you dare lay a finger on my Papa!
Mode: Hardshell Tortoise Pipi!
Hardshell tortoise?
Aww… you’re such a cutie pie aren’t you?
I’ll show you who’s a cutie pie!
Hardshell Tortoise Roll!
Wait!
Take this!
Ow... My whole body hurts.
-What do we have here? -Oh no...
Just what are you two doing here?!
Nothing!
We’re just here on Earth for sight seeing!
Sight-seeing?
More like Power Sphera stealing.
Pipi?
Wait is that EggaBot?
Indeed!
Without the daughter of Justice,
our Power Sphera would have been stolen!
Way to go, Pipi!
Throw these troublemakers in the cells of Justice!
Okay, Captain!
Please! Let us out please!
Don’t worry. You’ll be out in no time.
Huh?! When is that?!
When chickens fly.
I should never have followed you.
-Adu Du could have- -BoBoiBoy!
What’s wrong, Ochobot?
There’s an emergency transmission from the commander!
An emergency transmission?!
I tried to contact you, but the line was cut.
Why is everyone panicking?
Listen up, everyone.
-TAPOPS Station is under attack! -Under attack?!
As soon as you receive this message…
Head to this coordinate!
Follow my exact instructions!
Commander!
What’s going on? What's the message?
Commander just contacted us!
TAPOPS Station has been attacked!
What?! Say it isn't so!
The coordinates given by the commander point to a specific planet.
Planet Quabaq.
Planet Quabaq?
What kind of a planet is that?
-It looks kinda creepy! -That planet is not important!
We are not going there!
We need to go and save everyone at TAPOPS!
Hey! Weren't you listening?!
The commander specifically told us to go to the planet and follow his instructions!
But... we can't just leave them and not help them out.
Orders are still orders, BoBoiBoy.
What should we do, BoBoiBoy?
I’m ready to teleport.
No! We have to go and help them!
Get ready to teleport to TAPOPS Station!
All hands on deck!
Quick! Get ready for launch!
Fire up all the engines!
Arm the weapons!
-Shields at maximum! -Shields at one hundred percent!
All weapons, ready!
Teleportal ready to engage.
Breakfast, ready in five minutes!
Well... Looks like someone’s asking to be left behind...
Huh? The spaceship is moving!
Open the teleportal now, Ochobot!
Okay!
Teleportation Power!
We will arrive in...
Three...
Two...
One...
Warning! Incoming object!
Incoming object!
Warning! Warning! Warning!
Watch out Captain Papa!
Too late! Brace for impact!
Shields at fifty percent.
What did we hit just now?
That’s... That’s TAPOPS Station!
That’s... That’s impossible!
TAPOPS Station has been destroyed?!
Still refusing to disclose the boy’s location?
You can torture me all you want, but-
BoBoiBoy?!
Get out of here before he...
Silence!
Commander!
It appears all of this destruction has been unnecessary.
You should’ve arrived here sooner, boy.
Even Admiral Tarung has been beaten?
Oh no...
Who are these people?
What in the world…!
What? What’s wrong, Captain Papa?!
Look! Over there!
Papa, Papa…
I'm so sleepy...
Pipi Zola?!
Oh no! How did she get in here!
My wife is totally going to kill me!
Who are you?! Why did you come here huh?!
I am Retak’ka.
Pleased to make your acquaintance... BoBoiBoy. Huh? Me?
What do you want from me huh?!
Return my powers to me.
Your powers?
Yes...
The Elemental Powers!
What?
Did you really think you were the first to wield the Elemental Powers?
I am the true owner of the Elemental Powers!
Let go of me!
BoBoiBoy Blaze!
Blazing Chakram!
Impressive.
I never thought a mere child would be able to use the second tier elemental power.
I'll make you regret ever coming here!
How arrogant.
Allow me to show you the true Elemental Power.
Hey! Can't you see my daughter is trying to sleep here!
What was that?!
This is but a taste of what I can really do with your power.
Blazing Chakram Throw!
Surely you can do better.
Flaming Fists... Barrage!
Come to me!
BoBoiBoy!
-Slo-Mo Power! -Gravity Punch!
Crush every one of them!
Shadow Beasts!
High time we get out of here!
-Push me out Probe! -Okay, Mister Boss!
-Wait Probe! My head's stuck! -You can do it, Mister Boss!
BoBoiBoy...
The Elemental Powers are wasted on a child like you!
Surrender now or end up just like them!
Just like them, you say?
He beat them in just one shot?
We have to do something!
Captain!
Take BoBoiBoy and get out of here!
And now it is your turn to fall, BoBoiBoy.
Where are you?!
BoBoiBoy...
Penta Split!
Cyclone Veil!
Binding Vines!
Take this!
Thunderstorm Strike!
How irritating!
This is how you use your Elemental Powers?
By splitting up?
Earth Golem!
How pathetic!
Now, Solar!
Solar Eclipse...
Blast!
Yes... Excellent!
Channel all your powers to me!
Oh no… Solar, stop!
You've made the wrong move!
Perhaps a mere brat like you do not know...
Splitting only makes your Elemental Powers weak!
Return your power to its rightful owner!
Gamma Drain!
Solar!
BoBoiBoy only has three powers left!
Long have I waited for this exact moment!
Behold...
Retak'ka Gamma!
Maximum Power!
Earth Barrier-
You are not worthy to wield the Elemental Powers!
Let… Let me go!
Keep on wishing, boy.
Submit to me... my elemental powers!
Stop... Stop it.
How I have missed the Elemental powers coursing through my veins.
BoBoiBoy only has three powers left!
We have to help BoBoiBoy!
The time has come to complete all of my powers
Come to me!
Gopal?
Pull us, pull us up quickly!
Retak’ka Darkwood!
Our spaceship is stuck!
Hey! Get inside! We need to get going right now!
But... But what about the rest?
Don’t... Don’t worry about us.
Just go!
This is an order!
Don't forget to read my message, BoBoiBoy!
Find Hang Kasa!
Just go, BoBoiBoy!
I... I can't just leave them...
Hurry up BoBoiBoy! We need to go now!
Come on! Come on!
Burn down the vines!
On it, Captain!
Shoot down that spaceship Ayu Yu!
Huh? Ayu Yu?
Oh, Ayu Yu...
Rockets are red, lasers are blue,
How I love you, Ayu Yu...
We have entered outer space.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Get back!
Your face is turning blue, Mister Boss!
Shields at critical levels, Captain!
Huh? Open the teleportal now!
Coordinates identified!
Teleportation Power!
Hang on everyone! Engines, maximum power!
There is no escape!
I don't want to die, BoBoiBoy!
Watch out, everyone!
Drat! That brat managed to escape!
Master Retak’ka. What should we do now?
He can try to run...
but he cannot hide from me forever!
Come!
Let's move out Ayu Yu!
But what about this space station?
Annihilate it.
Roger that.
How is the admiral doing? Is everyone okay?
Warning. Shields at zero percent.
Evacuate immediately.
Huh? Papa's still asleep?
Wake up Papa! Wake up!
Don't be lazy!
Aha! I know what to do!
Nostril Poke of Justice!
Hey! What’s the big idea, Pipi?!
The window's broken!
Huh?! Watch your step, Pipi! The mud is acidic!
We gotta get out of here!
Not yet! We have to retrieve the information that Commander sent us! Ochobot!
The data in the computer is corrupt!
The spaceship is sinking! Run for your lives!
Just get what you can!
-Commander instructed us to find someone named... -...Hang Kasa!
Hang Kasa!
Hang Kasa?
Oh no, what is BoBoiBoy still doing?
Oh no!
What is it, Papa?
Justice forgot to pack our dinner!
Wait for me here!
What in the world...?
Faster Ochobot!
I've got the location! It's North of here!
On the mountainside!
-We have to go now! -Wait!
-I'm trying to get all of the mission data!
-There's no time!
Dey, come on Captain Papa!
Tuna, baked beans, tomato soup...
Ooh, chicken rendang!
Dey, Captain Papa! Get over here!
You wanna get yourself killed?
Better to die for food, than to die without it!
Huh? What are you doing there Pipi!
Nothing, I just forgot to take EggaBot with us.
No! Be careful Pipi!
Teddy bear, teddy bear, touch the ground!
Teddy bear, teddy bear, turn around!
Help! Help me, boy! BoBoiBoy!
BoBoiBoy Ice!
Freezing Ice!
Get out now!
Sprint of Justice!
Watch out Captain Papa!
Woah! That was cool, Papa!
Hashtag #PapaTries.
Oh no! Adu Du and Probe are still inside!
You're right!
It's empty! They're not inside the ship!
Huh? Where did they go?
Oh, my spaceship is ruined.
That’s okay Papa!
I’ll get you a new one from the store okay?
This is Hang Kasa. Find him and get the...
But be careful!
According to intel, he is the-
I’ve lost four of my Elemental Powers.
How would Hang Kasa be able to help me?
I'm not sure. The data is corrupted.
Let's just find Hang Kasa first.
Everyone’s in a bad mood...
Looks like I have to cheer them up!
Papa! I have a song just for you.
What song is that?
Papa goes to the supermarket,
Papa buys some chocolates by the pound,
Papa finishes all the chocolates,
That's why his tummy is really round!
Hey... Stop making fun of my tummy okay?
I’m so hungry- Let’s stop and eat!
Did you get any updates from TAPOPS station, Ochobot?
Not yet. I can’t seem to contact them...
Oh dear...
Hey, let’s take a break!
I can't feel my legs anymore!
I’m okay. I don’t feel tired at all.
Hey!
Have you forgotten I was carrying you?!
Why don’t you try carrying me instead? How about it?!
No, I don't wanna!
You’re right... It is getting dark.
I saw something in the bushes!
What?! What kind of animal is that?!
That’s a Kang Kong!
Kang Kong?!
Yes! This creature moves slowly during the day,
but it’s extremely fast at night!
What are you talking about? They don't look fast to me.
Gopal!
No! Stay away from me!
What's wrong with this guy?
They must be sensitive to light!
The flashlight tricks them into thinking it's daytime!
Oh! In that case…
BoBoiBoy Solar!
Your Solar element is gone, BoBoiBoy!
BoBoiBoy Blaze!
Oh no, there’s so many Kang Kong Papa!
Huh? Why is my flame dying out?
You don’t have enough energy, BoBoiBoy!
Oh no! Don’t die on me right now!
Oh my heart!
I’m going to bed now okay?
It's a school night.
Hey! Don't you hide in there!
You’re not even in school yet!
Come out and help me!
Oh no!
Run for it everyone!
Stay away!
Who… Who is that?
Do not worry.
You are all safe now...
My head hurts.
Huh? Where am I?
You are at a safe place BoBoiBoy...
How do you know my name?
From them...
-It's so yummy, Papa. -Yeah, let's eat!
Hey! BoBoiBoy’s awake! What? He’s awake?
Here, eat up! Eat up quickly, Pipi!
We don’t want him finishing up our breakfast.
Uh... Who are you?
My name… is Master Kasa the Black.
Disciple of Grandmaster Tok the White.
But you can call me...
Bro!
Bro?
Just kidding. You may call me Tok...
or Tok Kasa.
Tok Kasa…?
Could you be... the Hang Kasa?
Yes.
Did you know?
Our commander sent us to find you!
-Huh? Your commander? -Yeah.
Didn’t Captain Papa tell you anything?
I may have mentioned some stuff,
something about Retak’ka?
But the rest uh... Why don't you tell him in detail?
Justice needs to eat!
So good.
Papa...
I heard Retak’ka stole some of your elemental powers.
Yes, Tok.
That must be why my commander sent me here to find you.
Retak’ka was a student of mine.
I cannot believe...
that baldy has returned to wreak havoc.
Baldy?
Pretty sure he has hair Tok.
Hair?
Wasn’t he a four-legged baldy?
Uh... No, Tok.
My bad!
That’s my horse I’m talking about!
Do you think there is something wrong with him?
You have to help me, Tok!
Retak’ka, he... he already took four of my seven Elemental Powers!
Oh, Retak'ka!
The evil elemental master!
You mean, you do know Retak’ka!
I guess you can say that.
If that’s the case... Can I train under you Tok?
You certainly can.
Thank you, Tok!
Ochobot! Did you hear that?
Tok Kasa agreed to train me.
Huh? Ochobot? Where is Ochobot?
Oh... So Ochobot is the name of your Power Sphera?
Ochobot! Are you okay Ochobot?
I'm okay, BoBoiBoy.
Don’t worry.
Your Power Sphera is just running a mild fever.
Wait! Power Spheras can have fevers?
Kids these days.
Always questioning everything.
You’re right, Tok.
He does seem kinda warm.
It must be the weather.
Are you out of your mind?
Robots don't get sick!
These two Power Spheras are just running low on energy.
I will recharge and get them back to full power.
Very well.
Let's not waste anymore time.
If what you say about Retak’ka is true... You need to start training immediately!
You need to start training immediately!
Okay, Master!
We are ready!
We begin tomorrow!
Tomorrow? I thought he said immediately.
Keep going, Padu Du!
Hey. That voice seems familiar.
The ex-disciples of Justice!
Oh, so you used to be their master?
What sort of skills have you passed down to them?
The skill of deduction.
Huh? Deduction?
Indeed. I deduce that... these two are still lacking in skills!
these two are still lacking in skills!
You are absolutely correct!
Padu Du, Probobo, come here!
Come on.
We're here Tok!
Oh, so this is where you’ve been hiding Adu Du!
Adu Du?
I’m not Adu Du.
You must have mistaken me for some other alien.
Uh huh! This is Padu Du,
and I am Probobo!
And who might you two dirty looking peasants be?
Dude! Stop pretending like you don't know us!
Yeah! Don’t trust them, Tok!
They’re the bad guys!
The bad guys?
Are you saying, this handsome, small and petite,
dent-headed green alien is a bad guy?
Hey, hey! There really is a dent on his head!
Well, that was how I found him in the forest late last night.
Who’s this little green guy?
Perhaps... he has lost his memories.
Lost his memories?
Yes. Indeed.
The last thing I can remember was... was...
was seeing my beloved wife taken away by evil aliens!
Padu Du! My darling!
No!
Ayu Yu!
And that is why I have come here to train under you master.
I must find a way to save my beloved wife, Ayu Yu!
Dude! Ayu Yu is not your wife-
That’s admirable!
Wipe your tears, train hard and good luck oh young Padu Du!
You make sure you get your beloved wife back ya hear?
-Thank you! I will continue training! -Let's go!
Good luck Mister Humble Padu Du!
Work it til you make it!
Hey, Captain Papa! What was that for?
Oh, come on. Leave him be.
He deserves to experience happiness even if it’s false.
Keep going!
Padu Du!
For your wifey, Ayu Yu!
Observe Padu Du and Probobo carefully!
Tomorrow you will be joining them in their training!
Tok...?
Before we begin our training tomorrow,
is it okay if we contact our friends and commander first?
Huh? You want to contact the outside world?
You need a crash course on the Three Tenets of Training!
Three tenets?
What sort of tenets?
The first tenet!
You must never ever question my training methods!
No problem, Tok!
Second!
Training will be done in complete isolation! Not a single communication device or any form of technology is allowed!
Not a single communication device or any form of technology is allowed!
But why not Tok?
Training requires focus!
How are you supposed to focus...
when you’re distracted by the outside world?!
Take me for example.
I have reached this level of mastery because I never relied on technology.
So what's the third tenet?
The third tenet…
The most important one of all!
Wait.
I can’t remember.
Say what...
Was it having a stable income?
No. That tenet is for a housing loan.
You are not allowed to go inside my house!
This is a restricted area!
Then where are we supposed to sleep?
Out there, of course.
What kind of a joke is this?!
Justice... never sleeps outside!
Really? But mama always tells you to sleep on the sofa outside?
Hey! You can't tell people that!
Hey that's a secret.
Enough! Get some rest today.
Tomorrow, you will both begin your training to defeat...
that Ka’Ta Puntu.
Don’t you mean... Retak’ka?
Oh, yes... Retak’ka...
Are you sure we should be attacking this place?
This whole area is guarded by the elite Guruhan Soldiers!
You are scared of a few soldiers?
Of course we are, sir!
They have never once been defeated!
Come out and identify yourselves!
This is the elite guard?
Not bad at all...
Halt! State your intentions!
Retak’ka Voltra!
Elemental Drain!
Attack!
Come forth.
We need to go to BoBoiBoy's location Commander!
It’s not that simple.
Planet Quabaq is located deep within dangerous territory.
BoBoiBoy is not our priority!
We need to stop Retak’ka!
Stop Retak’ka?
None of you are his match.
True...
We were almost destroyed along with TAPOPS Station.
If it wasn't for Captain Kaizo's timely rescue, we wouldn't even be here.
Energy Barrier!
Captain Kaizo also managed to plant a tracker on Retak'ka's spaceship.
Let us wait for his report!
What happened here?
This is impossible!
Admiral! Commander!
The Guruhan Soldiers from Planet Gur'Latan have been defeated!
What?!
Defeated? How many?
It seems like... All of them...
All of them…?
The current situation is more dire than we expected!
But why Planet Gur’Latan?
Where is his location now?
They are currently in Sector G159A Nusagima!
What's in that sector?!
The sector has no known inhabited planets except…
Planet Bayugan!
What would he want with that planet?/
Oh! I know!
What is it, Yaya?
Retak'ka wants the elemental powers from the planet!
Look at this!
Planet Gur’latan is full of electrical energy!
And Planet Bayugan is known as a stormy planet!
He’s going to these two planets to enhance the elemental powers within him!
Looks like, Planet Bayugan is in danger!
Send a warning signal to them immediately!
On it, Commander!
I'm so sleepy...
Why are you all bundled up, Tok?
Oh, didn't I mention it?
On this planet,
cold icy winds can blow in the blink of an eye.
Blink of an eye?
Nothing's happening-
BoBoiBoy Blaze!
You're just lucky you still have your fire elemental.
Trainees came unprepared.
Points deducted!
Hey! Who are you to deduct our points?
Introducing my assistant,
tiny and bright, Pipi Zola! What?
How can you call Papa tiny, Tok?
Oh woe. That was really uncalled for.
Now then!
Are you two ready to face Tok Kasa's ultimate basic training?
Ready!
Coming through....
Excuse us.
What are you guys tiptoeing around for?
Shhh! Quiet you rookie.
Aha! That's the tree, Master Padu Du.
I didn't notice that tree there before.
That right there is your first training!
The Accuracy Training!
You must shoot the fruit on top of that tree!
On that tree? Shhh!
Aw come on! Just shoot!
It's not like the tree can dodge.
That tree actually dodged?!
What kind of tree is that?!
This is the tree we call Bak Bak.
It must be struck, struck.
BoBoiBoy Ice!
Ice Cannon!
Food Transformation Blast!
I missed?!
What is the use of strength without accuracy?
Ooh that was deep.
Hashtag too deep.
Chase it Probobo! -After it! -On it, Master Padu Du!
-After it! -On it, Master Padu Du!
-Hey, don't run, tree! -No wonder you missed!
You must first fix your horse stance!
-What horse stance? -Just do it!
What kind of horse stance is that?
This is a horse stance!
Are you for real?!
This is a hungry horse! Now you do it!
Don't forget the sound too!
Yes! Well done!
Now use your Ice Bow.
Now then. Try to shoot down these plates.
Here!
I... I wasn't ready, Tok!
Did you think I would go easy on you?
Step aside.
I'll show you how it's done.
Here, Tok.
Come at me!
Ok. Ready?
Ready!
Watch and learn, BoBoiBoy.
Here! Shoot!
Failure due to a stomachache.
What did you eat, horsey?
Horsey ate a whole plate!
That’s not funny!
Next training, please...!
The second training course is called the agility training.
You must venture into the cavernous lair of the Kang Kong.
They are a pack of dangerous and vicious creatures.
They move slowly in the light...
However in darkness, they move at extremely high speed.
Be wary as you approach the tallest rock formation within the cave!
Therein lies that which you seek.
What are we seeking again, BoBoiBoy?
What you seek is the leader of the Kang Kongs, also known as, King Kang Kong.
Your task is to obtain a strand of hair from the top of the head of,
King Kang Kong!
Shh! Tok! Not so loud please!
Oops. I'll get going then.
King Kang Kong's just up ahead.
Say hi to him for me.
Watch your step, Gopal.
They're very fast in the dark.
He's so huge!
Come on, Gopal!
How did I get myself dragged into your training...
He's bald?!
Shh! Keep it down, Gopal!
Dude. How are we supposed to pluck his hair if he's bald?
Watch out, Gopal!
Run, Gopal!
Yikes! The other Kang Kongs are awake!
Please don't eat me, Mr. Baldy!
We have to dash across using the light rays!
Hey! How's your training going down there my students?
Captain Papa?
Move! Don't block the light holes!
Get back, Papa!
The Kang Kongs will speed up!
Oh, thank you for reminding me, Pipi.
Good thing Justice has you!
But but... I can't stand it!
I wanna know what's going on!
Let's get closer.
What a brilliant idea!
Are you guys okay down there?
What's happening? What's happening? What's happening?
Run! Don't just stay in the dark!
Hey, hey! Run, run!
Get away!
Strange.
Someone just sent us BoBoiBoy's location.
We have arrived at Rimbara.
See, what did I tell you? Don't stay in the dark.
Did you listen?
No.
So! How did your second training session go?
They failed, Tok.
What? Failed again?
Of course we failed, Tok!
How are we supposed to pluck King Kang Kong's hair when he’s bald?!
I guess...
That's not my problem.
I must thank you, for sending the warning to our people in advance.
Retak'ka truly did come and attack our planet.
Thanks to Yaya the people of Rimbara are safe.
How is the evacuation process on Planet Rimbara going?
It's going very well.
There is only one village left.
Good.
Retak'ka's spaceship has been detected!
What?!
Prepare ArmoBot!
Here, here! Quick!
Inside, inside!
This is the last group. Prepare to depart!
Make haste! Retak'ka is here!
What?!
Cendaham, Cendasya, Cendamar, Cendapia, Cendalal,
Cendadam, Cendarin, Cendayad, Cendaqif.
Where is Cendamad?!
Cendamad's left behind!
-Cendamad! Cendamad! -Where are you?!
Cendamad!
-Little Cendamad! -Cendamad!
Over there!
Go and get him, Ying!
How peculiar. And here I thought you had all been destroyed!
Come with me, Cendamad!
Retak'ka Voltra!
You think you can outrun me?
-Gravity Punch! -Shadow Gorilla Punch!
You will regeret that.
Retak'ka Darkwood!
Get inside Cendamad!
-Mama! -Cendamad, my boy!
Let's move!
He's absorbing the Elemental Power!
You have to go, Commander!
It’s too dangerous for you to stay here!
But...!
Don't worry! We'll defend the spaceship from below!
Very well!
Where are you're going?!
Slo-Mo Power!
Deploy ArmoBot!
Right away, Admiral!
ArmoBot has been deployed!
Let's move out!
Let’s do this!
Why do I get just horns?!
What am I supposed to do with them?
New arsenal?
I will shatter them along with their owners!
Gravity... Blitz... Smash!
Take this!
Supersonic Kick!
How dare you-
Gravity Punch!
How irritating!
My hand is stuck!
Shadow Buffalo Hybrid Attack!
This horn ain't half bad.
Get over here you brat!
When will we ever complete our training, BoBoiBoy?
Beats me...
No matter how many times we try, we keep failing the tests.
Hey dude! Were you even listening to me?
Sorry...
I was just thinking about Yaya, Ying and Fang.
Why are you worried about them?
You should worry about our training instead.
Because if we worry about them...
we’ll start missing them! I wanna go home!
I wanna go home, BoBoiBoy!
I wanna go home too, Gopal! I wanna go home!
Let's get our training done BoBoiBoy!
The sooner we complete it, the sooner we can go back home!
Let's do it!
Sometimes I wanna be like everybody
But there are times I wanna be somebody
Wanna be a champion
Gonna make it happen
They say you gotta live your life with virtue
Cause we’re only really just passing through
Yeah face it and find your courage
You gotta believe it
So I try and I try, no I’m not giving in
Chasing that flickering light
So I try and I try, no I’m not giving in
Reaching that place out of sight
I’m fire, and I’m water
You have given me the power
I’m earth, and I’m nature
Yeah you got me feelin’ like
I’m rising up
I feel it now
I’ll never let you down
I’m rising up
I feel it now
I’ll keep you safe and sound
I’ll give my all to face it all
Together we can take it all Woah oh!
I’m fire and I’m water
You have given me the power
I’m earth and I’m nature
Yeah you got me feelin’ like (yeah!)
I’m fire, and I’m water
You have given me the power
I’m earth, and I’m nature
Yeah you got me feelin’ like (oh!)
Boy oh boy oh boy oh boy
Don’t go down without a fight (oh!)
I’m fire, and I’m water
Why do we keep coming back to this cave?
It’s not like he's going to grow hair so soon.
Well you never know... It might just suddenly grow.
I know one thing for sure.
Every time, we keep on failing again and again.
And how do you know you've failed?
What? You’re the one who keeps telling us we fail every time.
Fail! Fail!
Fail again!
An utter failure!
-Pa- -Pa-?!
Did we pass?!
Pathetic!
You see?
Don't tell me you forgot.
This is what you don't understand.
You may have failed the training course.
But the training course has not failed in training you.
What do you mean, Tok?
I don't get it.
Yeah. You mean we failed in failing our failure?
Observe closely.
What gives, Tok?!
Why’d you suddenly attack us?
Do you not realize it?
I... I get it now!
Tok has way too many dishes for a hermit!
That's not it!
We... We're a lot faster now!
Yes. So you do get it.
Do you understand now?
I do, Tok!
Our agility and accuracy has increased!
That was the real point of the training!
Indeed.
Now for the real test...
Let us see if you are fast and accurate enough to seize this crystal from me!
You’ve got it.
If you succeed, I will consider your whole training complete.
Our training will be complete?!
Come on, Gopal!
But I still don't get it.
Our failure... failed to... fail us?
You just sit there until you get it.
Awesome...
BoBoiBoy Triple Split!
Good day, Tok!
I've prepared my report for you!
I really can't wait to show you!
Doesn't look like anybody's home.
Hey! Don’t enter the house!
This is restricted area!
I thought he said he doesn't use technology,
but his house is filled with all these gadgets.
Hey, you're right.
He even has an electric guitar.
Welcome home, Tok Kasa.
What? Your favourite iced milk tea, with cream on top.
One hundred twenty five calories.
He even has a ButlerBot!
Where do these stairs go?
Three against one and you are still struggling?
Flaming Breath!
That’s really hot!
Earth Golem!
Take this!
He is definitely a lot faster...
Gopal?!
Hi Tok!
Cookie Crumble Transformation!
My crystal!
No!
Grab the crystal now, BoBoiBoy!
I didn't get it...?
Huh! I got it!
We did it!
Way to go, BoBoiBoy!
That was awesome, Gopal!
How's that?
You didn't see that coming, did ya?
You sure had me fooled with your act earlier.
So, Tok.
This means...
we passed all of our training right?
Yes...
Congrats! Congrats!
You two have passed indeed!
And now...
Time for you to pay your training fees...
-Huh? Training fees? -Of course.
Did you think all this training was for free?
But, we don't have any money to pay you with.
All I’ve got is, one dollar.
What would I want Earth money for?
I can't use it here.
BoBoiBoy! Gopal!
Disciples of Justice!
What’s up with Captain Papa?
So then... How should we pay for your fees, Tok?
Oh, don't worry.
You can pay me like this!
What’s going on, Tok?!
Let me go!
I will be taking your quake elemental power!
No!
My... My Quake Power is gone...
But... but why, Tok?
Because... Tok Kasa is a liar!
A liar?
That's right! Here. Look at this!
Huh?! Ochobot?
BoBoiBoy...
We found Ochobot all hooked up to the machines in Tok Kasa's house!
Poor Ochobot.
What?
Hey! Are you even listening?!
Get out!
What is this place?
That's Ochobot!
Forgive me, Tok Kasa.
I tried to stop them from trespassing into your house.
But they refused to listen!
Who are... who are you really, Tok?!
I am...
the original user of the Crystal Elemental!
Crystal Elemental?
Yes.
The third Elemental level after Earth and Quake.
We've been tricked, BoBoiBoy!
Oh? I didn't trick you at all.
Look at this.
Hey, hey! Give him back!
BoBoiBoy!
Run away and head to Planet Quabaq!
Huh?! Wasn't the data from the Commander corrupted?!
Tok Kasa fixed my data bank...
This is Hang Kasa.
You must find him and find out a way to defeat Retak'ka.
Commander...
Commander never told us to train under him!
According to intel,
Hang Kasa was Retak'ka's old friend.
Retak'ka's old friend?!
How is that possible?!
It's a long story...
Tell us, Tok.
A very long time ago...
I met Retak'ka on the desolate planet named Gugura.
The dumping ground for all things unwanted.
Such as Retak'ka and I.
Please, Tok Kasa...
Can you please cut this short?
Oh... Of course.
Retak'ka and I were best of friends.
He found the Power Sphera Light Gamma,
I found the Power Sphera Quake Crystal.
But as we grew older, he became greedy.
He stole five more Elemental Powers!
And then, he came after my power.
How could he? What do you think? Huh?!
No, he shouldn't have!
And that is why I had to stop him.
I used a special Power Sphera, Ochobot,
to drain all of Retak'ka's Elemental Powers.
So... you do know Ochobot?
Is Ochobot your grandson?
-It's a long story. -Shorten it.
No!
Tok Kasa! Tok Kasa!
You have a message from Retak'ka.
Retak'ka?!
Imagine my surprise to find you alive...
You have not changed at all.
Still cunning and deceptive!
Did you think I would not find out?
It was you who sent me the location of those brats!
Tok Kasa used us to bait Retak'ka!
I will not go to Quabaq and fall for your obvious trap.
If you really wish to stop me...
you must come to this planet.
Earth?
He's heading to Planet Earth?!
If it wasn’t for these pathetic kids,
Fang! Ying! Yaya!
I wouldn’t have learned about this planet that contains all seven elements.
I will see you there.
Let me go, Tok!
I have to go back to Planet Earth!
Why are you spacing out, Tok Kasa?!
Was that...
really Retak'ka?
Of course, Tok.
What's wrong?
You don't recognize your own BFF?
But why does he look the same?!
He should be much older by now.
Oh, man... My crystals must have kept him youthful.
How am I supposed to fight him now?
I didn't expect to fight a young man.
Huh? What are you doing Papa?
Well. What else?
Justice...
also wants the elixir of youth!
It seems...
I have no choice but to use my greatest technique.
Show yourself.
Hello there. Are you looking for Hang Kasa?
Who is that old guy?
Apologies. Hang Kasa couldn't make it.
He’s got a stomachache.
What kind of a lame joke is that?!
You mean that's his greatest technique?!
Uh... Do you see Yaya, Ying and Fang anywhere?
I see them!
They're inside the spaceship!
Must be something he ate.
That's why he sent me here in his place.
Did you really think I would not recognize you, Hang Kasa?
Hey, calm down.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
What's up, bro?
Do not waste my time!
Hand over that boy and your power!
Oh... So you want to play rough huh?
Very well!
Behold... KristalBot!
A Power Sphera?!
Time for me to put an end to what you started one hundred years ago!
Wow. So 80s. Me likey!
Crystal Shield!
Look at all those crystals!
Let’s grab as much as we can!
-Come on! -Let's go!
Break us out of these crystals!
Are you ready or not, Pipi?
Not yet!
It's not fully charged!
Hey! You don't have to wait until it's 100%!
But Papa always says...
To get A+, I have to reach 100%
That is correct, my daughter.
Study hard, okay, Pipi?
How it warms my tummy.
Captain Papa!
80% is more than enough!
Sheesh... Fine, fine.
Hurry up, Pipi!
Okay!
EggaBot! Mode: Hardshell Tortoise!
You’re out of shape, old man.
Retak'ka Darkwood!
Retak'ka Gamma!
Take this!
I must thank you for crystallizing me.
Now...
Not a single soul can stand in my way!
Retak'ka... Tempest!
Farewell, my old friend.
I will wipe your existence off this world!
Stop!
Don't you dare hurt Tok Kasa!
Finally you're here.
If you really wish to take his place...
then by all means!
BoBoiBoy Ice!
I'll freeze you!
Where are you?!
Here!
Retak'ka Darkwood!
Let go of me!
How pathetic...
Such amazing Elemental Powers,
but wasted in the hands of an incompetent child!
BoBoiBoy is in danger!
Wait Ochobot!
We can't let Retak'ka see us here!
Knock, knock! Hello!
-Is anybody home? -Hey, hey!
What on Earth are you doing?!
I'm just saying hi. What else?
There they are!
Where do you think you're going huh?
Uh, nowhere!
We were just headed to the market, right, Pipi? Right?
Uh huh! Got any vegetables?
Vegetables?
I'll turn you into one!
Not only do you dare attack an innocent lady...
you also kidnapped my beloved wife Ayu Yu!
You are an alien with no honor!
Do not worry, my darling!
I will rescue you from these vile fiends!
Hey! I do not need to be rescued!
Oh dear.
Save me from this absolutely embarrassing moment.
Just a little bit more...!
Ow!
Pipi!
My precious girl...
Did that hurt?
I guess he's not too bad...
What did you say, my dear?
Are you okay, my love?
Oh... I'm okay... but...
You're not okay!
How could you block the love coming from this block-shaped head lover.
Re... Release me.
Very well.
If that is your wish then I shall grant it!
I will release you from your never ending torment.
By ending you now!
I will pound you to dust...
BoBoiBoy!
No!
Tok Kasa...?
You're still here?
Why... why did you save me?
It’s okay when you play the hero...
but when I do it, you’re surprised?
Tok Kasa...
Forgive me, BoBoiBoy.
I did not intend to deceive you.
But I needed to take back the Crystal Elemental Power to stop him...
You want to stop me?
What a pathetic joke.
I'm... I'm sorry, Tok.
I'm not strong enough.
I can't defeat him by myself.
No... But you have a strong will.
Stronger than Retak'ka and I could ever be...
All this time you held all seven Elemental Powers,
but I see now that you were never corrupted by those powers.
Unlike him!
Huh?! What did you say?!
Yes! You are weak!
You were overcome with greed!
You are not the same Retak'ka that I knew.
Whom I once called, my best friend.
Silence!
Tok Kasa!
Defeat him, BoBoiBoy!
I... I can't, Tok.
I only have two Elemental Powers left.
Two Elementals?
I defeated him with only one Elemental Power you know.
Go and take back all your Elemental Powers, BoBoiBoy...
Enough with your nonsense, old man!
Tok Kasa!
Papa... It hurts...
Serves you right for meddling in adults' business.
Pipi, get some rest first okay?
Justice... will teach you what being an adult truly means.
EggaBot! Mode: Papayam Egg!
Cock-a-doodle-do!
At long last...
Your Crystal Elemental Power is finally mine!
I defeated him with only one Elemental Power you know.
Splitting only makes your Elemental Powers weak!
I...
I actually just need one Elemental Power to defeat him!
I thank you... Hang Kasa, my old friend.
Retak'ka...
Crystal!
Finally.
Now, it is your turn to be destroyed.
Surrender your Elemental Powers to me!
My turn...?
You're wrong.
It's your turn now!
BoBoiBoy... Dual Split!
You still insist on splitting?
Oh, we're not splitting.
We are...
merging!
Elemental Fusion!
BoBoiBoy...
FrostFire!
What? You've found a new way to use the Elemental Power?
I will make you regret over what you've done.
You overestimate yourself, boy!
Blazing Frost Punch!
Blazing Knee Strike!
So how do I activate your Elemental Drain, Ochobot?
Hardshell Tortoise Roll!
I'll go help Tok Kasa.
Gopal, find a way to activate Ochobot's Elemental Drain!
Huh? Me? Why me?
Hey BoBoiBoy!
Wait up!
Oh man... I can't do this!
Let me help you with that.
Tok Kasa?!
You're still alive?
Why do you look so surprised?
I just fell asleep. What?
I will put an end to your evil reign!
You dare think you can end me?
Dream on, boy!
Crystal... Spikes!
Blazing Frost Arrows!
Here! Take this!
Papayam Peck and Scratch!
Stop that!
Oww!
Papa!
That'll teach you.
How dare you attack Justice from behind?
Behold!
Papayam Eggs in a Basket!
I didn't know roosters can lay eggs?
What can a harmless egg do?
Why don't you see for yourselves?
Rotten Eggxplosions!
What is this smell?
It's nasty!
What is this smell...?
I think I'm gonna pass out again...
Impressive.
However, it's going to take more than that to defeat me, boy.
Let go of me...
BoBoiBoy!
Take Ochobot!
My Elemental Drain is activated!
Elemental... Drain!
No!
Quake Crystal Elemental Power, successfully retrieved!
How dare you!
Slo-Mo Power!
Don't even think about hurting BoBoiBoy!
Shadow Dragonfire!
I am not beaten yet.
How could that...
-puny brat... be able to- -Puny brat?
Who are you calling a puny brat?
You've lost.
I may have lost...
But I will take you all down with me!
Let... disaster... strike!
BoBoiBoy Dual Split!
Elemental Fusion!
Let destruction consume you all!
Ice Gargantua!
You are not worthy of this power!
No!
Don't you dare...!
You'll pay for what you've done!
Elemental Fusion!
Thunderstorm!
Solar!
BoBoiBoy...
Supra!
Supra Shift!
Super Supra Blast!
I... I finally beat him...
BoBoiBoy!
BoBoiBoy is awake!
BoBoiBoy!
He's awake?
Are you okay, BoBoiBoy?
I'm okay.
How about you guys?
We're... not too bad...
But don't you worry about us.
I'm glad to hear that...
Thanks for helping me out earlier guys...
Huh? Who are those people?
They are the Cendawa Tribe from Planet Rimbara.
Commander. Admiral!
The Cendawa people will be staying here on Earth for a while,
to oversee the rebuilding process on Earth.
BoBoiBoy!
Tok Aba?
Mom!
Yaya! Ying!
Gopal, my boy!
Hi Appa.
This time I brought some curry with me!
Appa!
Mama!
Honey!
Why did you bring our little girl with you?!
Uh, uh! Oh no!
Forgive me honey!
Hey, don't tell me you're scared of your wife?
Hey! But of course!
Justice... is always scared of his wife...
-Run for it! -Get back here!
Yay! We're playing tag!
Don't run!
Where is he?!
Mama, Mama! Papa's up there!
Trying to hide?!
So all is well that ends well.
All seven Elemental Powers are now safe in the hands of BoBoiBoy...
It's now time for me to take my leave...
Remember to use your Elemental Powers for good, BoBoiBoy..
Continue to become a worthy hero.
One who will never succumb to his greed-
Tok Kasa?
You're still alive?!
Gopal! Why didn't you tell him I was alive?
What? Me? How is it my fault?
You're still alive, Tok!
Why didn't you tell me?
If I had told you, you wouldn't have unleashed
all that supra supreme stuff now would you?
Sheesh...! Tok Kasa!
Who is that Gopal?
His new grandpa?
-It's a long story... -Cut it short.
Yep!
What?!
Run the diagnostics, Amato.
Repair my Power Sphera.
Strange.
Why didn't you join the battle yourself?
It wasn't my fight.
You are the one who should have helped BoBoiBoy.
There's no need.
He needs to be independent.
We're on an island.
There's a storm.
The wind is blowing sand and dust into our eyes.
I can't see her clearly.
As if I had forgotten my contact lenses.
A small, compact body. A rich skin tone. Darker than mine.
Her feet only touch the ground briefly,
then she runs away.
She looks at me quizzically.
Her face remains blurry.
I recognize her from her body language. It's his.
I try calling her, but I've forgotten her name.
Dreams are like that. Things change with no logic. We accept that in dreams.
We're helpless and do as we are told.
The fertilized egg implanted perfectly well…
but unfortunately there is no heartbeat anymore.
Look.
I knew it. I didn't feel anything lately.
The embryo is only four millimeters.
The physical process is basically imperceptible.
I did think I felt something.
Here.
At least we can expect a spontaneous miscarriage
at this early stage.
No curettage this time.
I'm so sorry that I don't have better news for you.
It's not your fault.
Please, come in.
Aside from the psychological impact
there is the huge strain from the hormone treatment.
You shouldn't underestimate that.
I'm okay.
The body just needs some rest now.
May I suggest something?
After the fourth attempt, I always suggest taking a step back.
And to reconsider your life plans.
You are aware
that further attempts are not supported by the I.V.F. funding, right?
Maybe you could do something nice together.
Maybe take a nice vacation.
A deductible of 954 as a previous I.V.F. patient,
fifty for consultation, plus 250 for semen preservation and storage.
That's 1,254 euros.
-It's not working today. -Alice, can you use yours?
-My limit's too low. Can we wire it? -I'll give you the bill.
Hi.
Hello.
-Hello. -Hello.
I'll be right there.
BASED ON THE SHORT STORY "DER LAUF DER DINGE" BY PETER STAMM
Signal. The ferry is this way.
Sure?
Yes, there--
-Yes. That was the exit to the port. -I think it's the next one.
There was a sign with a ship on it.
We've missed it.
Yes, but there it says "porto." "Porto" means "port," right?
I can't see. I forgot my contacts. Do you want to drive?
Should I?
It has a screw propeller.
How can a ship sail with a screw?
-They moved the ticket counter. -Okay.
What happened to the tent?
Did you throw it away?
When we were moving.
It was broken.
Isn't that the road to the campsite?
No, that's somewhere else.
Mr. Janaceck.
Mr. Janaceck? Yes?
Yes.
But isn't it… It's all leak-proof, right?
Yes.
Yes, well… Then…
all we can do is wait.
It'll be better tomorrow. It's pouring in Vienna.
Yes, thanks anyway. Goodbye.
I forgot to say it is also a center for exposure therapy.
We should ask if it's the right house.
That was quick, right?
It definitely is.
Lucky we didn't take my car. We would have had to charge it.
He's always on the iPhone.
David, come on. Put the phone down, get out. We're here.
Thanks for helping.
-Wow, we got an amazing house. -Did we?
Oh, look. A Vienna license plate.
They're everywhere.
There must be a store. The neighbor bought something.
Near the entrance.
Right. You…
-Shall we fire up the grill? -Yes!
So, and now I'd like lots of carbs and olive oil and grappa.
And share my dessert because you don't want one,
and in the end you'll eat all of it.
Hey…
Can we afford that?
I think we can afford a tiramisu.
I mean the vacation.
Wrong question. We need this.
I'll take a shower.
What is it?
Am I being greedy?
I'd say you're enjoying the food. It's nice.
My grandma used to say, "He doesn't need a wife, only dessert."
-Oh, you did it all wrong. -She'd see it differently now.
Seeing me with such a beautiful wife.
Mom, I can't fall asleep.
Can't you be quiet for one second?
It's almost 10:30.
Your garlic smell is very nice.
It keeps you young.
My grandma used to eat a whole garlic clove per day.
I want to be with you!
Mom!
Not a moment's peace. Not even at 10:30. Not even then.
Nobody will tuck me in. Not even at 10:30. Not even then.
Not enough to drink. Not even at 10:30. Not even then.
Stop with the drama.
-Always such a fuss. Off to bed. Quick! -We have to take that with us.
Mom, can I have ice cream?
Not before lunch, sweetie.
When is lunch?
It's only just after nine.
Mr. Janaceck, good morning. I was just about to call you. Yes?
Is the weather better?
Well, maybe in the afternoon. Regarding the basement, yes.
With the basement in this condition, it's useless to us.
And that's really inconvenient because we have lots of material to store.
It would be great if you'd finish the walls
before we get back from vacation and at least tile the large room.
Can I have a bite?
Yes, sure.
Yes?
Nobody sees the basement, and they cost only half.
Take the whole thing. My treat.
-Really? -Yes.
Thank you!
-He's still asleep. -Excuse me.
Sorry, neighbor, is this your croissant?
Yes, no worries.
-Thank you. -Yes.
Very kind of you. Sorry.
Yes. I'll forward you the quote for the tiles,
so you have it in writing.
Yes.
Denise, come! Mom has to do her bananayama…
I have to do pranayama.
She's doing her banarama.
Goodbye.
Denise, leave Mom alone. She has to do her bananarama…
It's totally okay to leave the attic unfinished for now.
We can build a large room up there later.
Very spacey, all open plan, okay?
I'd be happy if we just had a roof.
Well…
Will you go to the pool with me?
We're going to the beach, as always on day one.
Why?
It's just the way it is.
Do that later. You can't concentrate anyway.
Can we blow up the docrodile?
It's "crocodile," not "docrodile."
Oh, the Viennese are up as well.
-Morning. -Morning.
Morning.
Christel, where's the pump?
At home.
Unbelievable. Who did the packing?
-Well, not you. -Do I have to blow this up myself now?
Cut out that tone.
You can do it, Dad. You can do it.
You're the strongest!
It's not that bad.
That's the tail.
It looks bigger than it is.
David. Come out of there.
I'm studying!
You'll get a shade allergy!
You know what? You go ahead and I'll see if we can change the house.
Okay?
-Signore? -Io… una… question.
Sì. Prego.
Si possibile de…
Shall we speak German?
Oh, yeah, great.
I was wondering if it would be possible to switch houses.
-Is there a problem? -Yes, I…
-Buongiorno. -Buongiorno!
Hi, neighbor.
Hello.
We would prefer…
-We'd like more sun in the morning. -No problem. I'll check in our system.
Hold on. Is it because of us? No. We just want more sun in the morning.
-Then we'll move. -No, out of the question.
Da noi, um… another… um… niente… children's bed.
There's no children's bed, so…
The children's bed is at our house.
At your house?
We have a nice house. A bit smaller, but very sunny.
As you wish.
You know what? Never mind. We'll stay at the house.
Okay. Then I'll send someone to pick up the bed.
No. We can do that, right?
Sure.
-Romed. -Niklas.
-Hi. -Hello.
-Are you all right? -Yes, I'm all right.
Does it hurt your back?
Excuse me?
Is your back hurting from carrying this?
No. It's not heavy enough for that.
Well, you never know with you city people, right?
That's you.
The sad woman.
Why sad?
How would I know?
What's your name?
I'm Denise.
And when I grow up, I'm going to be a downhill skier.
Denise, come here! We still need to put sunscreen on.
Gotta go.
A girl gummy bear.
Did you make a new friend?
There was no way around it.
How about you? Any luck?
They said they're booked up.
She's actually really sweet.
And their accent is hilarious.
-Let's climb the Bichl backwards. -Sorry?
Let's climb the Bichl backwards.
My back hurts, you lass.
Where did you learn that?
Goddamn, get off my nuts.
I want to go back in the water.
Lass… I don't give a shit what that is, but I think it's exactly what I am.
Lass…
Do I look sad?
What do you mean?
I was wondering if it's written all over my face.
Nonsense.
You're beautiful.
Like a lass.
Don't be afraid! Go in!
No need to be afraid of the water.
That's a vacation!
-You only arrived yesterday. -Yes.
You're from Vienna, right? Your license plate is from Vienna.
But you don't sound Viennese, I have to say.
Yes, I had some work there, just for a couple of weeks.
Then I met my wife and got stuck there.
.And what do you do professionally? -I'm a social worker.
Wow. Respect.
I couldn't do that.
-And you? -Metalwork.
Nine employees.
-Business is going well. -Cool.
-Where? -In Hall. Do you know…
-Tyrol. We're from Tyrol. -I was in Tyrol every winter as a kid.
-I can ski better than you guys. Yes. -I'd like to see that.
Oh, the lady.
You got a little sunburned, huh? Christel.
-Yes, I'm skin type one. Alice. -So, Alice. Romed. Hi.
-Thanks! -Happy holiday!
Cheers!
-Cheers. -Cheers.
What do you do that you bring your computer on holiday?
Sorry?
What do you do… professionally?
You're always on your laptop in the garden.
That's not for work. We're building a house.
Virgo, ascendant Pisces. For sure.
Pisces because of your sensitive skin, Virgo because of your career focus.
Virgo is correct. I work at a bank. Customer service.
Well, Christel here just got her certificate in astrology.
-And she's been analyzing ever since. -Exciting.
Yes.
You don't have kids, right?
No.
-You're so lucky. -Yes.
-Mama! Papa! -Yes… Maybe it's not in our stars.
-Probably! -Right now!
Okay, let's go.
-See you around? -Yes.
-Mama! Papa! -Ciao.
Do you play tennis?
-Yes. -Let's play a match.
-Sure. Yes. -Awesome.
Great.
See you.
Well done, David. Did you annoy Denise again?
Crested Caracara.
-That was okay, right? -Yes.
Crested Caracara.
I always think I should order fish, but end up getting pasta.
Let's order drinks first.
Why do they even have a child?
That way the parents can at least have a conversation.
They probably envy us right now.
Yes, maybe.
Buona sera.
We'd like a bottle of the house wine.
Rosso? Bianco?
-Rosso. -Okay, perfetto.
I'd say your ascendant is Gemini.
-Why? -Because you always have two servings.
You can't-- Do you know how much I ate?
Yes, I know. I was there.
-Hey, come. We'll do that now. -What?
There.
No.
-Yes. -I can't move.
No, really, I can't. Stop! Please, no.
-I want to go to bed. -It's so easy.
Look, there's no one here.
That's the great thing.
Yes.
-Why didn't you put sunscreen on? -I did. But just once.
Turn around, please.
Jeez.
You're no Pisces. More like Cancer, I'd say.
Are you doing the certificate, too?
What did the boy do today?
He was at home. He said he studied.
I just can't get through to him.
I'm about to lose my patience. I'm telling you.
At his age, I got only As in school.
I played soccer, tennis, I helped Dad at work during the summer.
-You can't compare yourself to him. -Why not?
He isn't a kid anymore.
-He is. He's only 13. -I never got to go on vacation.
He's indoors, hasn't even seen the sea.
I would at least take his phone away, but I have no say.
Come on, don't be like that. It's just a phase.
I hope so.
And we all went through it. You too.
He'll get over it.
He used to be so great.
Oh, shit.
Toby just started high school, right?
Yes, great.
That's good to hear.
Well.
The reason I called is that…
there have been some changes to our budget and I… Yes.
And I wanted to ask you
to have a look at our contract again and think about
if we can increase our credit limit by another 15,000.
I've been telling customers for years and now I'm in the same position.
What a surprise.
Hey, Romed, could you be a dear and bring me the nut oil?
Which one?
Yes, great.
Thanks, Mr. Wagner.
Good.
I'll be back at work on Monday.
I could meet you at 9:30. Would that work?
Well, the one I use.
The weather is perfect.
There are bottles everywhere.
Yes, you too. Goodbye.
Can you put lotion on my back, please?
Sorry.
Sorry?
That was out.
On the line.
-No. -Yes, it was on the line.
I don't think so.
Shall we replay it?
It's always the same with you.
Okay, replay.
That was more luck than skill, but it's okay.
Hurry, before I take back my offer.
Take back the part about skill.
Definitely not.
You're such a bad loser.
I just passed on a replay.
I even let you win a couple of sets to liven up the match.
Can I have some, please?
Sure.
I'm sad today.
Why?
You don't always know why.
Yes, that's true.
Can I have some?
Here you go, gallivanting girl.
What's a "gallivanting girl"?
It's a girl who always runs away.
David?
From what?
-You don't always know. -Denise?
-That's true. -Here!
Sorry. Where is David again? Come on, Denise, honey. Alice has to work.
No, not at all.
Sorry, I guess you expected a bit more peace.
No, we didn't.
Don't worry.
Come, Denise, come on.
You're always running away.
Take care, sorry!
Mom, why did you go to the neighbors naked?
I'm wearing pants.
Where's David now? David?
David?
Oh, there you are.
-I'm going swimming. Wanna come? -I don't wanna go swimming.
Wanna play tennis?
I don't wanna play tennis.
There's a via ferrata not far from here. If you want to. You might like it.
First the canyon, then a nice meal…
and then we'll also have a really nice evening.
Why "also"?
-Did I say "also"? -Yes.
I don't know why I'm so tense at the moment.
Hello.
You again?
Do you want to play with me?
Okay, but not for long.
Okay.
-Do you mind? -No.
Are you in a children's choir?
Am I in a children's choir? No.
No.
Why, you?
Yes.
Yes?
Our Father in heaven
Hallowed be your father
Good. Very nice.
And now we pray.
Why would we pray?
-Don't you go to church? -No.
But then your wishes can't come true.
Yes, maybe.
May I?
Oh, it's already evening for you.
Yes.
Denise! Wait… Sto--
Denise…
Will you give my glasses back?
Hold on a second.
Denise. Ca--
Denise…
Denise, that…
-Shit. -You're not supposed to say "shit."
Yes, I am. Shit.
-Denise! -They were damn expensive.
Are you mad? No swimming without water wings!
She said she'd look after me.
-I didn't know she-- -You'll give me a heart attack.
I'm sorry.
It's okay. How could you know?
Let's go!
Oh, Mom.
You'll have to take swimming lessons after all.
Jerk!
I built a wine cellar, had one built. It was worth it.
We've got like…
It looks great. We've got… we put a volcanic tuff in there.
It looks amazing.
Ah, like a really old wine cellar? Well…
Not really. It was built in 2009. But it looks a bit like an old one.
-What about the temperature? -A cooling system.
In a separate room. You can't see or hear it.
Wow, crazy.
Look how beautiful those flowers are.
Look.
Let's hurry home.
The cellar is my kingdom.
If I want peace, I go in there. It's all mine. It's fantastic.
I get why you don't want kids.
Would you rather have another wife?
Would you rather sleep with Christel?
I mean, I don't need a wine cellar, but I wouldn't mind a sauna.
It's not that expensive.
You also like saunas.
We should make it all really nice.
Maybe a… a small swimming pond.
If it all works out, we could put… some carp in it.
Do you know koi carp?
They're quite expensive, but…
Alice?
-Hello. -Hi.
Sometimes I think we should sell it.
I didn't know you only deserve a house if you have three kids.
We deserve a nice life, too.
Even without kids.
But I don't want a house. Or a dog.
Or a sauna or a vibrator instead of a child.
Don't you get it at all?
We haven't discussed everything after the Czech Republic and egg donation.
Or we adopt but you don't want to hear that.
No, I don't.
I want our own or none. I am that egotistical.
I would like to have your cells and my cells.
My hair, your eyes.
I want us.
What's wrong with my hair?
You always have to avoid things.
With your jokes and your body.
I do understand you. Totally. I also want our own little gene pool…
just from the two of us, running around in our garden.
But we have to face the fact that our wish might not come true.
You're talking to me like a bad therapist.
But I'm not the one who needs therapy.
Like in the movies, huh?
I made such a scene.
I do understand you.
Don't always say that.
Come on. Get up.
I would really like to have sex with you.
Oh well. I'm always at work.
Family, no time for anything.
Why did you give it up?
I don't know. No idea.
I tried.
All right, helmets. If you need them. You never know.
-How does that work? -Exactly. Tighten it.
All right, those are my back-up shoes. Try them.
Don't be surprised it's good if they pinch your toes.
Nice and tight.
That's good, otherwise you can't feel the rock.
Morning!
We want to try out the via ferrata at Rocca Doria.
It was his idea.
Sure.
Nice.
I don't think she liked the idea.
Shall we go tomorrow? Fine by me.
It's all right.
So.
-Are you sure? -Yes.
Well, if you say so.
Does that look right?
Yes. Hey, but I'm not taking the blame. All right? Just so you know.
-She'll calm down. -Yeah?
Are you on vacation with Romed?
I've wanted to climb again since forever.
Oh, shit.
Hello?
Yes.
Excuse me?
But Mr. Janaceck said the offer was still good.
That…
What?
We were counting on that.
It's not our fault they mounted the shingles wrong.
I won't let you call me naive.
Would you talk to my husband this way?
Yes.
Yes, I want to know-- Yes.
I will definitely not calm down right now!
Asshole.
I just don't get yoga. Do you?
No.
I can't force myself to relax.
The only beautiful thing in life is music.
I wasn't going to.
The fucking battery's dead anyway.
The way you threw your phone away just now… So cool.
One small step…
and I'd be gone.
There would be nothing left of me.
What do you mean?
Nothing. Just saying.
Hey.
Where were you?
I couldn't reach you.
Are you okay?
-The roof will-- -I'll fire up the grill.
We're invited.
So I didn't bring it for nothing.
We won't stay long. Promise.
Dad, I'm so hungry.
-Stay away. -Hey!
It's really hot.
How much longer?
I can't even get any peace at the grill.
Buongiorno.
Hello.
Where is Alice?
She sends her regards, but she has heatstroke.
Poor thing. She needs to drink a lot.
So do you. Grab yourself a beer from over there.
How is the construction coming along?
Not great. The roof is more expensive than expected.
Yeah, I know. Always the special wishes. Be careful.
I went gray overnight when we were building the house.
There they were, all of a sudden.
It was horrible.
But all the special wishes were your idea.
Which normal person has a yoga room at home?
Won't you have a sausage?
No.
-I just need to be alone right now. -Being alone isn't nice.
That's what I think.
Are you still mad at me because of the glasses?
Yes.
You can have them.
It's so dark.
I'm scared a storm is coming.
Let's have some Prosecco.
I have to have dinner otherwise I won't get ice cream.
What a body! He's got such a great body.
-Come here, sweetie. -Can I have ice cream?
The 2010 one is fabulous. Just the right amount of spice.
A nice, smooth body. It'll melt in your mouth.
Neptune conjunct Midheaven. Oh, dear.
Why?
The opener is a joke.
-Did you drink lots of water? -Hey.
Why?
Sit down. Have some good wine. It's good for everything.
-Actually, I'm here for the ice cream. -One sec…
We have pistachio ascendant stracciatella on offer.
You're such an idiot.
Sounds great.
Let's do a couple's horoscope.
-Place and date of birth. -David, eat some more.
Ninth December, seventy-nine, near Hanover.
Oh, Hanover.
See? I told you. Time?
I don't know.
Ascendant Pisces. No need to calculate.
-Here, your gelato. -Thanks.
Ah, are we hungry after all?
You're a really spicy combination.
Sagittarius and Virgo.
And his sun, that's your sun…
is in a square aspect to your Venus, oh, dear.
In what way?
You have a Saturn-Sun-Mercury conjunction.
You're very disciplined and modest.
But your Saturn is in a square aspect to the moon.
That could be an issue, with having children and…
Christel, you're overdoing it, aren't you?
You can't stand it that I'm better than you at something.
Not every woman is cut out for a family.
Let's leave it at that.
I wanted to say something positive about the situation.
Trying so many times to no avail…
Awful.
One's never happy, right? For us, it was the other way around.
With David, I had just turned 17. It was an accident.
Thanks, that's enough.
Just relax. It'll all work out.
That's unlikely.
Unlikely and unaffordable.
Not every woman has to be a mother to be a complete person.
-Your body is smarter. -Can you please be quiet now?
Sorry. She talks and talks and never listens to what she's saying.
-Nature is often far smarter than us. -Stop it, please.
The problem is that we believed we were smarter than nature.
What do you mean by that?
I was pregnant once. No planning. Just by making love.
We were here on Sardinia. Camping.
-We'd just started dating. -Alice.
Such a nice vacation, though it rained the whole time.
How is this any of their business?
We agreed that we weren't ready yet.
That we didn't really know each other.
I saw the heartbeat at the doctor's, but turned away quickly.
Did you get rid of it? Oh, dear.
Go ahead and cry. It helps.
That's not true. I've been trying for years.
It's getting pretty cold, isn't it?
But tomorrow's weather will be great again.
No astrological advice on how we move on from this?
She's Catholic.
That was apparent then.
I don't know why you're talking about this with a couple we just met, but okay.
You started it.
I told Romed when we went climbing. I needed someone to talk to.
You could talk to me.
You haven't touched me in months.
Do I disgust you?
Hey, you're exaggerating.
I'm just not in the mood at the moment. I don't know.
You're afraid of me.
You're crazy.
It's true.
Because you can't make it happen.
Because your shitty sperm is far too slow.
Take that back right now.
You only want sex with me because you want a child.
You take that back.
I didn't start it.
Nature is probably right.
Something's not right.
Fucking Pisces!
Caffè?
First, you can't have sex for 14 days,
and on the day you're supposed to have sex,
you have to have it at 11:25
because at 12:00 it could already be too late.
-That's an inconvenient time of day. -Indeed.
But you have no desire to sleep with him. You don't even want to see him.
But you still lie down.
Because… chances are higher if you're on the bottom.
Although you prefer to be on top.
Then you put it inside you.
He doesn't look at you. You don't look at him.
And for what? Nothing.
Then you try fucking in vitro again.
...degrading, you know?
Would you want to be conceived like that?
No.
David?
David!
David! Come on! Let go!
David! What the fuck have you done?
David!
-Stop it! You're in the way! Move! -Leave me be! No!
No!
David, sweetheart…
David!
Wake up! David, wake up!
David!
David.
Wake up! David!
Is it a good or a bad sign?
What do you mean?
That they're still not back.
I don't know.
He was never in the water.
Never.
We're so sorry.
Can we do anything for you?
No, there's nothing we can do now.
We just have to wait.
And hope that he wakes up.
They pumped his stomach…
He took everything we had in our medicine bag.
Pain killers, sleeping pills…
even the… the allergy medicine Christel uses.
Well.
He's always been a dork.
He has everything, the boy.
Can I say goodbye to Christel?
No.
Not now.
But thanks.
For being such good neighbors.
Are you coming, Denise? We're leaving.
Get in the car, Denise.
Cosa?
Niente, scusi.
He woke up.
Shit, that must be hard.
What?
He feels like a total loser.
Like me.
-I'll make some tea, okay? -Yes, please.

One of those panoramic ones.
Of course we can.

Look at the idiot! Retards.

Shame on you.
We're sorry, teacher.
Good. Go on.

A Heidi backpack!
Heidi backpack!
What's up, Memo?
How's it going, girl? How's school?
-How much for this backpack? -400.
It's very expensive.
Give me what you have. We can take care of the rest later.
No, no.
-Take it, boy. -No, Grandma will be mad.
-My goodness! -Come on.
We can't buy it, right? It's too expensive.
I'm going to sell candy apple tomorrow at the parade.
Then we'll buy it, just like that!
Always the same.
This can't go on, Rıza!
You have to do what everyone else does.
I'll tell Grandma, I swear.

Come here.

What's wrong with my dad?
What's wrong with him?
Is my dad crazy?
Mind your words!
Don't make me slap you.
But they say so.
Who says so?
The kids in school.
You tell them,
''If you call my dad crazy again,
I'm going to tell Nana
and she's going to cut your tongues.''
I'll tell Nellie over there, I swear.
Rıza.
But he's not like the other dads at all.
No, he's not.
He's not like anyone else at all.
Do you know why?
Because your father is the same age as you.
My father is the same age as me.
All right, go.
Enough already.
Enough, go on.
All right, enough. Go.
Walk, come on.
Come here.
Walk! Come with me.

You won't go away like Mom.
Dad won't go, Ova.

Thank you!
O, jewel of the skies, crimson and white
My sister's wedding dress,
The final cloak of my martyr
Basking in light,
Flows in waves, my flag
I read your legend
And I will write it down, too
Those who would not see you as I do,
I will dig their graves
The bird who would fly without hailing you,
I will break its nest
There can be no fear or sorrow
On the lands that you flow over
Please, please take me in your shade
So what if the sun never rises, the morning never comes
The light of your crescent and star is enough for the homeland.
The day war took us to the snowy mountains
We were warmed in your crimson
-Ova! -The day it lowered us to the dunes
We took shelter in your shade
-What are you doing? -O, you the pure!
Flowing in the wind
Dove of peace, eagle of war
My flower, blossoming up high
I was born under you
And I will die under you
-Children's day! -My history, my honor,
my poetry, my all
Pick any place on earth
Tell me where you want to be planted
And there I will plant you
Heidi backpack is gone!
Heidi backpack is gone!
-Thank you. -Enjoy it.
But sir, we were going to buy that backpack.
We brought the money.
I'll order another one, all right?
But we were going to buy that, here's 400.
What is this?
-Don't mind them, sir. -Move.
They were interested in it for some time.
Leave it, son.
Memo, stop. Come back here.
Sir?
Here's the money, you take it.
-Step away. -But, this...
This is the one Ova likes. It's Ova's.
Sir.
Dad!
Who are you to touch my daughter?
Don't, sir. He's a half-wit.
It's all right. Go back to your posts.
Mount vehicle.
Come on, daughter.
Lunatic! It's nothing.
Sheep, come here.
Where's the backpack?
There isn't one. It's gone.
Gone where?
Seda's father bought it for her.
Oh, dear!
Whatever. Don't be so sad. It's just Heidi.
That's not why I'm sad.
Seda's father hit Dad.
Memoş?
You're okay, right?
Huh?
You're fine, right?
Grandma.
Will Ova smile?
She will. She will.
Don't you feel small.
You're no different than any of them.
You have more, not less.
You have a beautiful heart, son.
Come on, get up.
Get up and herd the sheep.
Come on.
-It was a great idea to come here, right? -Yes, sir.
-Are you hungry? -Yes sir, real hungry.
Thank you for the invitation, sir.
Of course, Staff Sergeant.
-Fresh air is nice. -Yes, sir.
Don't fan that much, you're going to burn the meat. Slow down.
Yes, sir.
These young privates are like children.
They don't know anything.
Don't call grown men children, sir.
Those anarchists we called children almost burned the country down.
-Seda! -Brother!
Stop!
Stay with your mother, Rıza.

There's blue on the crazy guy! Go!

Brother! Enough, he's Ova's dad.

-Kids, the meat is ready. Come here! -Come on, Seda.
Do you like this backpack that much?
It's the Heidi backpack.
Seda's dad bought it for her.
Enough with the backgammon. Dinner is served.
Come on, come on.
You can't catch me!
Look at my backpack!

Son, where's your sister?
She's playing with the crazy guy. I called her but she didn't come.
Aydın?
Can you check on her?
He said she's playing with the crazy guy. Go check on her.
He got her. Memo got her. Memo got her.

Don't do it, sir. Don't do it!

I want to see Mehmet Koyuncu.
-What's your relation? -He's my grandson.
You can't see him.
-You shouldn't see him. -Why? Why shouldn't I see him?
He drowned a little girl in the lake.
Mehmet?
-Mehmet wouldn't do such a thing. -He did.
-There are witnesses. -He wouldn't, son.
He has a daughter that he dotes upon.
He confessed, ma'am.
-No, he wouldn't. -Go away.
-I'm busy. Go. -Just let me speak with him.
He's like a child.
Only I can understand him.
Son, just let me speak to him.
Please, for the love of God.

Never mind Dede Efendi,
even God himself can't straighten this place out.
That's blasphemy, son.
You're talking like this now because you're in prison,
what are you going to do when you're in Hell?
My God!
Didn't you say on my first day here,
''God makes people he loves suffer here, you will be all right in the next world''?
What happened to that?
That wasn't from the book.
Just something my late mom used to say.
I never saw my mom's kind of Islam in any book, to tell you the truth.
''Mother is the Truth,
Have you learned this secret?'' says the song.
This is what I've read, Askorozlu. What you say is shirk.
And this is what Neşet said, Hafiz.
Whatever it may be.
It's all about concentration.
-I don't remember asking. -What happens when you concentrate?
Do these walls come down?
Concentrate on your own business. No one's talking to you.
Just give me an answer, what happens?
He's still concentrating on me.
What is he doing in the open?
Askorozlu punished him after his last suicide.
He has to look at other women until he's free of heartache.
The girl he snatched got married.
It doesn't fucking work!
It doesn't work!
It doesn't work!
I can't fucking concentrate!
How can she do this to me?
How can she? How?
Cut it out!
Stop it!
Don't make Askorozlu lose his temper.
Warden, the new inmates are here.
Move. Stand in line. Over there.
Good afternoon, Faruk.
It's Captain, Warden.
These aren't bird shit.
There's special instruction for one of the inmates.
Don't bother trying to take him to interrogation.
The Gendarmerie can't just take people anymore. Regulations have changed.
Read it.
Which one of you is Mehmet Koyuncu?
-Me, officer. -This one!
Don't, don't.
Enough!
He is our responsibility now.
Captain.
So be it.
Warden.
If you make even one wrong move,
I will kill you myself.
Got it?
Can I go home?
Take him in.
-All of them. Come on. -Come on!
-Come on. -Go.
Inside.
Don't let others know what he did.
You're right. They would kill him.
Strip, boy!
Quickly!
I said strip!
Hello.
What are you doing here?
Cooking mushrooms. You?
One of my friends fell down into the lake here.
I saw.
Did you, really?
Yes.
Did you see my dad too?
The shepherd?
They thought he did it.
Can I bring my nana?
Will you tell her too?
Yes, I will.
Hooray!
Wait here, I'll be right back.
-Okay? -Okay.
Would you like some bread and cheese?
Halt.
You come with me.
And you stay right here. Got it?
Don't you move an inch!
Why isn't he coming?
I'm going to give you your mattresses.
I can't deal with him right now. You take both of them.
What's up?
What are you doing?
What do you want, boy?
Are you mad?
Askorozlu.
Call Ali.
Is he staying here?
-Take your mattress. -Ali.
Get in.
Get in.
Ali is the ward representative.
He will tell you the rules and such.
-May God save you. -You go over there.
And you there.
-What did they do? -I said go!
The tall one is a prisoner of fate.
The other one's not to be told. Warden's orders.
Don't make me mad, now!
-Warden's orders, my ass. Tell me. -He...
They beat him up pretty good.
What did he do?
He killed a little girl.
Come on, Nana. Here.
Where is he?
Where is he, dear?
He isn't here. He's gone.
I'm scared!
-I'm scared. It's dark! -Move aside.
It's dark!
I'm scared.
I'm scared.
You're scared, huh? Fuck you!
You fuck!
No, Nana. Let's wait a little longer. Maybe he'll come back.
Come on, girl.
It's almost dark.
I'm not going.
I'm staying here!
Ova.
My child.
Are you sure that it wasn't your imagination?
Yes, I'm sure it wasn't.
I really saw him.
He said that he would tell you.
Don't cry, sweetie.
Don't cry, my child.
Come on.
Come on.
How is he?
It's a miracle that he's still alive. There are a lot of broken bones.
Let's keep him in the infirmary for a while.
Okay, it'd be better.
Do we know who did it?
How can we, Warden?
They found out what he did.
They won't let him live.
Captain Faruk.
Lieutenant Colonel Aydın.
Yes, sir.
I sent special instructions to you regarding Mehmet Koyuncu.
We're following it to the letter, sir.
The Warden wrote a petition.
He asked him to be transferred for his safety.
Sir, the inmates in the ward--
Shut up!
Would I send him there if I wanted to kill him?
I will have him hanged, make an example out of him.
Everyone will read in the newspaper
what happened to the man who did this to my daughter.
That dog will not silently disappear!
Understood, Captain?
Understood, sir.
Sorry?
Yes, sir!
Skipper.
This is Cengiz.
He has a request.
No need.
May God save you.
Thank you, sir.
I'm listening.
I was going to say...
Be quick!
Sir, I play the bağlama.
They took my bağlama.
The guards didn't let it in.
Got it, all right. I'll tell them to bring it here.
-Ali. -Thank you, sir.
-Get up! -Come on, get up!
-Get down from there! -On your feet!
-Over there! -Move!
-Get up! -Form a line!
-Move! -Get in line!
-Move over! -Get in line!
-What the hell is this? -Move!

Good evening, gentlemen.
What did you do?
Huh?
Did you think that you were bringing the child killer to justice?
Her father is a Lieutenant Colonel!
Lieutenant Colonel!
He's God, as far as you're concerned.
You will not touch him!
You will not touch him!
He'll be on the end of a rope when the time comes.
We will punish him, not you!
Do you fucking get it?
Anyone touches a hair on him,

So, Selim...
It's warmer now, why are you still here?
My hand slipped this time, Skipper.
I missed a little, so the judge missed a little too.
My release is postponed to the end of July.
But God willing, I'll be back here next winter.
He's like a seasonal worker.
It's a sin.
How can you stab someone just so that you aren't on the street in the winter?
You don't know how cold it is in our town.
Piss off, you heretic.
Tevfik.
Are you feeling better?
I'm fine, Hafız. Thank you.
Why do you do this, son?
You're so young.
What happens to those who try killing themselves?
Do you know?
Nisa surah states that,
''Don't kill yourselves.
Those who take their own life
will suffer greatly and severely in the afterlife.
And remain in Hell forever.''
God speaks the truth.
Yes, brother.
Skipper, what should we do with him?
Do whatever you want, just don't kill him.
Put him with Selim, he can help him.
-Selim! -Yes, brother?
For the love of God!
Fuck off! I'll rip your arms off!
It's okay, Skipper.

Thank you, brother.
So, they made up their mind, huh? They're going to hang him.
The dead girl is the Commander's daughter.
Nobody can save him.
Never mind all that.
This man is crazy.
He shouldn't even be in here, let alone be executed.
I asked Şeref.
He said that the health board cleared him, but...
Cleared him?
He has a brain the size of a pea!
Maybe they made him the scapegoat for someone else's crime?
It's possible.
Damn it.
He should be able to see his child before he dies.
Where's my mom, Nana?
She's an angel now, I told you.
She went to Heaven.
When do you go to Heaven?
You go whenever the man upstairs calls you, my child.
Who's the man upstairs?
God, my dear.
Will you go to Heaven too?
I hope so.
Only God knows that.
So...
If you go to Heaven, who's going to take care of me?
Don't worry, Ova. I'm going to be here until you grow up.
I won't leave you.
Go to sleep now.
How many days until Dad comes back, Nana?
Not many.
I don't know exactly, but not many.
Go to sleep already.
Come on.
I am going to...

Her mother?
My Ayşe became an angel.
When Ova was a baby.
God rest her soul.
Ova doesn't remember it, but I do.
Look at him laugh.
Was it love at first sight?
I don't get it.
Skipper asked how it happened.
Did you see her at the bazaar or at the market?
Or did she see you first and liked you?
You're quite the catch!
-I got it. -You didn't get shit!
Where did she see you, how did it happen? Tell us.
I saw her at home.
Grandma. Grandma took me.
Said, ''You are getting married.''
Ayşe looked at me, and smiled.
Then I smiled at her.
Imam came and married us.
After that, we went home.
We got in the room...
Good God!
-This guy! -My goodness!
Hey!
What about the wedding?
-There wasn't one. -Why?
I don't know.
What do you know, Memo?
I don't know.
I'm not very smart.
-Grandma says so too. -What does she say?
''Memoş doesn't know.''
Why does she say that?
So that they don't get mad!
We're all passengers, we come and we go
We're all passengers, we come and we go
Is the world your country, your homeland?
Is the world your country, your homeland?
-What a talent! -Congratulations.
Thank you.
BLOOD IS CLEANED WITH WATER NOT VENGEANCE
-Get over there. -What are you doing?
-Get over there. -Who the hell are you?
You don't know me, Askorozlu.
And I don't know you.
Hüseyin Ağa sent me. He sends his regards.
Hüseyin Ağa?
Hüseyin--
Memo, stop!
-Stop! Memo! -Stop!
Stop! Memo!
Fuck!
Memo!
Get over here!
Get over here!
You got stabbed!
It hurts! It hurts!
It hurts, Askorozlu!
I'm going to fuck you up!
-No, it's a sin! It hurts! -I'm going to fuck him up! Let me go!
Askorozlu!
-What's going on? -What happened?
It's okay. This asshole attacked me!
-Get up! -Stand up!
It burns! It burns!
Hafız!
It's okay.
It's okay, Memo.
-It's a sin, don't do it! -Are you okay?
You're unbelievable.
It's all right.
How did he get the knife inside?
He didn't.
We did.
He snuck it in the bağlama, the dog.
Thank God Memo came in time.
So, what do you say?
Are we doing this?
-Skipper, we'll dig our own graves. -This is nonsense.
How can--
Which one of us is as good of a father as him?
Who in this ward is that aware of their fatherhood?
Tell me.
This is going to happen.
This is a debt of life now.
If they find out, we're done.
We'll never get out of here.
-That's what I'm saying, if they-- -God hears who praises Him.
Can you do this?
I'll be damned if I can't.
Welcome.
Thank you, Skipper.
I'm going to ask you something important this time.
I'm listening.
You will sneak a child in here.
-Sorry? -Psst!
A child.
So, what is it?
Askorozlu wanted a gun, we got it.
He wanted a rifle, we got it. He wanted rakı, we got it.
Now a child?
He wanted a child?
For what?
She's going to see her dad.
Who's her dad?
He didn't say. He got pissed.
Think about it. Who can he be?
Come in.
Warden.
Order of execution.
Mehmet Koyuncu.
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DEATH SENTENCE NOTICE
-Here she comes. -Okay.
Lingo lingo!
Bottles?
How do you know that?
Come here.
Your dad sent us.
We're going to take you to him. But you can't tell anyone.
She knows him. I swear.
She got it from just a word.
She knows him, right?
She got it right away.
She has his eyes.
No, I don't think so.
Don't make Hatice go crazy!
Are you mad at me?
No, my dear.
Why would I be mad at you? You're innocent.
But my dad is innocent too.
Of course, he's so innocent.
I WENT TO SEE DAD
There, dear.
Your father is over there.
But, you go by that door for now.
-Where's my dad? -Over there. He's coming.
You can't see him here, it has to be in there. Go.
Be quiet, okay? Go.
Welcome, Hatice.
I brought your child.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What gives?
Something's wrong.
What is it?
I have something to say to you.
Then I will get out of here.
What happened?
I was 17 years old.
What did you tell me?
Huh?
That we'd run away.
What did I do?
My parents didn't approve.
What did I do?
I ran away, didn't I?
What did you do?
You stabbed someone.
Where were you when I gave birth to the first boy?
You trashed Pepe's store and smashed his head.
Hands off!
Off!
What did you do when the second boy was born?
You cut someone again.
What did you do when your daughter was born?
You shot someone.
You told me not to bring your daughter here
so she wouldn't see you here.
My daughter...
Our daughter... Look at me!
Look. Off!
What did I say to all of this?
I said okay, didn't I?
What am I going to say now?
I'm going to say no!
I'm going to say no!
-What are you-- -Let me go!
Sit the hell down!
What the hell are you talking about?
You're going to say no to what?
She's so cute, praise be!
She has your eyes.
Shame on you.
Shame on you.
Who?
The girl?
That girl is not mine. What are you talking about?
What are you talking about? Don't make me yell.
Gentlemen.
Tea is on the house.
Dad?
Ova?
Dad!
Ova!
-I missed you so much! -Ova! Ova!
Ova!
I'm here, my dear Daddy!
I'm here, Daddy, I'm here!
Memo's child!
Ova went to the one-eyed giant.
There was someone there, she found him.
He said that the girl fell.
He said that Ova's dad is a good man.
That he'd tell what he saw.
He said he'd tell.
I, Ova...
went, la, la, la.
I went, one eyed-giant there,
She went ahead, stop, stop. She--
What happened?
Ouchie.
But, here too.
And here, and here.
Welcome.
Is your name Ova?
What a beautiful name.
Ova.
Would you like this?
You can have it.
A present, Ova!
Teacher, present, teacher.
Ova, come back. No, no.
Look.
I can't make those, Ova.
I wrote you a letter, Ova. Why didn't you reply?
Are you looking at the tree?
Ova!
Ova!
God save us!
Where would she go?
Ova.
My child.
Swords!
Brother!
Is she here?
He's not my dad. You are.
Memo's child.
Whose child is she? I don't get it.
I fried my brain laughing.
Dad, is everyone here a bad man?
Girl.
Is that so?
No, no.
Everyone here is my friend, Ova.
My friend.
Girl.
I got you.
Memo got Ova.
You rascals!
I can't find him.
He doesn't come when I'm there.
This witness can really save Memo.
Well done, girl.
You're so smart.
Smart Ova!
It's time. We're going.
Dad?
Ova?
Ova.
Your dad is sick.
Once he gets better, I'll send him to you.
I'm staying with dad.
And I'm staying with Ova.
But this is a hospital, my dear.
These guys are all sick.
But you all look well.
No, no.
We're all sick.
What is your illness?
Me?
My illness...
He got sick because of a girl, but he's getting better.
How?
I saw a very pretty girl and snatched her--
Whoa!
-Whoa, nellie! -You fucking--
-Good God! -God forgive me.
I wanted to marry her without her consent.
When she didn't want me...
I wanted to kill myself.
That was my illness.
To kill yourself?
It was stupid.
As it turns out, love...
is not to kill yourself for someone, but is to live no matter what.
Hello?
Ms. Mine, how are you?
I'm sorry?
What's your illness?
My illness?
It's...
I used to fool people unintentionally.
I used to take their money.
I've never heard of such an illness.
Don't you get it?
I fooled them and ran away with it.
There was a Beril in our class.
She fooled me and ran away with my bread.
Just like Halil.
Halil, it's a sin. It's a sin.
Did you need money?
A lot.
Here. I'm not going to buy anything.
Nana gave it to me.
I can't take it.
Take it.
Take that too. Don't be shy.
I got the news yesterday.
My brother won the lottery.
We don't need money anymore.
Did you hear that, Ova?
He won the lottery!
Don't count me in.
I just work here.
He's a seasonal worker, Ova.
He comes in the winter, goes in the summer.
And you?
Me?
You're a very lucky girl, you know that?
Why?
I...
had a son.
And his mother, of course.
When my son was a baby,
I couldn't protect him and his mother
like your father protects you.
What happened to them?
They became angels.
Because of me.
Did you get better?
For me...
it will take some time, Ova.
Come on, Ova.
We're late, let's go.
You didn't tell, what's your illness?
I made a lot of people angels.
Did you make my mom too?
No. That wasn't me.
I quit. I don't make angels anymore.
Why?
Because I may have made some a little too early.
Come on, we're late. Let's go.
-My dad? -Me, me!
I will bring him to you when he's better.
-Promise? -Yes, I promise.
Come on.
Come on, let's go.
Ova?
Maybe it's better if you didn't ask him.
What's your illness?
I...
believed those who lied to me.
My daughter of wedding age...
Come on, Ova.
Come on, dear. We're leaving.
-We're late. Come-- -We're fucked!
-Quickly! -Don't curse, there's a child!
The guards, they're all here!
-Shit! -What's happening?
Hide!
Over here! Ali, over here!
Lying is the worst.
Both in this world and beyond,
when you are--
Welcome, Warden.
What is this? What are you doing?
We're having our usual conversation.
Is your daughter here?
Move.
Ova, you're it! Run!
What do you think you're doing?
What?
Hafız, for God's sake!
Any of you.
Give me a sensible answer.
Askorozlu, what is this?
Ward confinement, two days. No courtyard.
Don't you see?
You asked where she is,
and he showed you.
He has a brain the size of a pea!
I have a report from the board that says this man is sane!
A martial law commander put him in here!
Of course it says that!
Warden.
We believe that Memo is innocent.
The whole ward, we all believe it.
The dead girl
is the Commander's daughter.
This man was found next to her, covered in blood.
What can anyone do now?
The girl mentioned a witness.
Talk to her.
If you find that witness, you'll save Memo from the noose.
Just talk to her.
-The girl's just-- -Nail!
You're a good man.
What do you have to lose?
What if she's telling the truth?
Act as if you don't know me, okay?
You don't know me, okay?
Never saw me before.
Okay.
Good girl.
Ahmet, take him to the ward.
Yes, sir. Come on, Memo. Get up.
Ova, eat your food, okay? I eat here, you eat too.
Askorozlu will send me when I get better.
-Come on. -You promised.
-Get up, come on. -Yes, I did.
-Come on, move. -Can I stay a little longer?
Let him go, my dear.
-Come on, get up. -Ova.
All right, walk. Come on.
Walk, Memo. Come on.
Come on.
I'll take you home.
Ova.
Maybe you can tell me about that witness on the way.
Come on.
Teacher! Teacher!
They believed me! They believed me!
Of course they did.
Everyone believes truth tellers.
Why is everybody in our house?
Nana!
Ova.
Where's Nana?
Ova.
Your nana, Fatma...
became an angel.
Did she go to Heaven?
She went to Heaven.
But she told me she wouldn't.
She said that she wouldn't leave until I grow up.
Who's going to take care of me now?
-Peace be with you. -And with you.
There's supposed to be some ruins around here.
-Do you know where? -Yes.
Can you show me?
The kid was trying to tell us all this time.
It's obvious why the witness is missing, he's a deserter!
Nail, he's a martial law commander!
His daughter is dead!
Does someone being there make what she says true?
Okay, you're right.
Shouldn't we investigate?
It's a possibility, even if it's a small one.
What if she's right?
This man doesn't feel like a killer.
Do you think that it's that easy?
We would all be fucked!
Faruk.
We have to find the deserter and listen to him.
Patience, patience.
There's more if you like, Memo.
Let me eat this one first.
Eat.
Eat, Memo. Enjoy.
Slow down. Don't eat the spoon.
Slowly, eat slowly.
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
We always thought
that it's just a stain on the wall.
It really looks like a tree.
That stain, Hafız...
is the tree I buried my daughter under.
My innocent daughter.
Now tell me, Hafız. Where do I go in the afterlife?
What about my daughter?
Where does she go?
Heaven.
Would the man upstairs allow me into His Heaven?
He works in mysterious ways.
God is forgiving.
You will get out of here in 1.5 years.
I will not.
Hafız. I can't.
I can't live anymore, not in here, not out there.
-I don't deserve the sun. -No.
Don't talk like that. How can you say that?
Nisa surah states that--
Don't start with that now.
I'm not that callow boy.
I can't be with my daughter,
not even in the great beyond.
Only God knows that.
Jesus said, ''Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.''
Are you the only sinner here?
Just look around.
Everybody carries something that keeps them up at night.
You can't find happiness by staring at a stain or a tree.
You have to stand up and ask for forgiveness.
You have to get out of here.
If you hurt your own daughter,
you have to save other children.
Ova.
I have great news.
The Warden found something on that hill.
You were right.
There was really someone there.
They're doing all they can to find him.
They'll find him eventually.
I'm sure of it.
I, too, love my dad very much, you know that?
Just...
My dad is a little strict.
He's not like your dad.
He looks that way.
So they don't think that he's weak.
He's not really like that.
I always wanted to...
hug him like you do, just once.
I couldn't.
He always took great care of me and my sister.
But he didn't hug us once.
Like your dad.
Would you like me to take you to your dad?
Gendarmerie Captain Faruk Önder.
Patch me to Lieutenant Turan.
Turan.
Hi.
Anything new on the thing I mentioned last night?
The girl was right.
A deserter was there when it happened. Şeref told me.
So?
-The Warden's trying to find the deserter. -What if he can't in time?
He will! Don't be negative!
Don't speak ill.
Look.
-Hatice. -Aziz.
My daughter.
Sweetie.
Sweetie.
My dear girl.
Let me look at my boy.
My boy.
How are you?
Come here.
My dear boy.
Take a seat.
Come on.
Come here.
How are you, Hatice?
God be praised.
-How are you, Aziz? -I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm better now that you're here.
They've grown so much. Look at them!
Come over here.
Sit next to me.
How are you, Dad?
I'm fine, my dear boy.
This time it was my turn, but we all came.
I'm going to come next time too.
Come, boy.
Come, my boy.
Come all together from now on.
No more turns.
Did you hear that?
You can stop nagging me.
How are your parents?
They're well.
Praise be. They said hello.
Hatice.
I've been thinking...
When I get out, I...
I'm going to take my boat from my brother.
Work on my own.
And from now on...
These guys will help me, right?
-Okay, Dad. -We will, Dad.
My boy.
Thank you, Mr. Nail.
-If you didn't... -Don't mention it.
I wish I could do more.
What are they doing?
They're setting up the gallows.
This fast?
They're in a hurry.
They want to get it done before the elections.
Objections, petitions...
Nobody cares.
An appeal for show.
That's all.
They're going to execute Memo.
-Hasan? -He's fine too.
And Zeynep?
She's fine too. They're all fine.
Naughty Rıza?
Fine.
But you said you didn't have anyone.
I don't. I have Grandma and Ova.
But you mentioned 50 people.
Not 50, eight.
Who are those?
The sheep.
You gave people names to the sheep?
This asshole--
Not all of them.
What, then?
There's Milky, there's Coffee.
Why are those different?
Because one is the color of milk.
And the other one has stains like coffee.
Good God!
Ova, how's Grandma?
Nana became an angel, Dad.
I'm sorry, son.
Dad.
Dad.
Dad.
Grandma.
At ease.
Did you desert from the Gölbaşı Gendermarie Command on April 23rd?
Yes, sir.
Were you around Kapıkırı
at 1600 hours on the same day?
Yes, sir.
Did you witness the incident on the rocks?
I did, sir.
Speak.
We found him, Nail.
He verified everything the little girl said.
Memo is innocent.
Let's go.
Come in.
-Sir. -Come in, Cevdet.
-Remove the cuffs. -Sir, yes sir!
You can leave.
Sir, yes sir.
Why did you desert your outfit?
I couldn't take it anymore, sir.
It's hard, huh?
-No, sir. It's not that-- -Shut up!
He couldn't take it.
You witnessed the incident.
Yes, sir.
Good.
What you know can save the crazy man.
Yes, sir.
Tell me.
The kids were playing by the lake, sir.
Then that shepherd came.
Other kids went away, the girl stayed.
The girl was showing her backpack to the shepherd, sir.
She was playing with him.
-He tried to escape. -Sir, yes sir!
Turan. What's going on? What's with the face?
Lieutenant learned everything from the boy.
The witness said that Memo is innocent.
But then the Commander wanted to speak to the boy.
When they were speaking, he tried to escape.
And the Commander shot him.
Is he dead?
He died right there.
He's really bent on Memo.
What the hell is this?
A deserter died, who's going to investigate?
God forgive.
Fuck this shit!
Can't we do anything?
WHO COMES IN DECENTLY LEAVES RESPECTFULLY
Memo.
Come with me.
Get up, boy.
Ova's here.
Teacher, why are we waiting here?
We're going to see your dad.
Why don't we see him downstairs?
He's coming upstairs.
But I have friends in the ward too.
Really?
Did you hear that?
Ova has friends downstairs.
Of course, lots of them.
You can see them anytime you like.
Come in.
-Ova! -Dad!
They said that we're meeting here today.
Ova doesn't eat.
She's thin like Milky.
Heidi has an aunt, Ova doesn't.
Grandma is gone too.
So... who's going to take care of Ova?
No, Memo. I take very good care of Ova.
Don't you worry.
I'm staying at my teacher's for now. We'll go home when you get back.
Our home.
Yes, we will. Memo will come,
and we will go home.
Yes, Dad.
Can I go with Ova?
Be patient, Memo. In a couple of days.
Look, Dad.
We go to sleep, wake up, go to sleep, wake up and then you'll be home.
I'm going to come get Ova, right?
Yes, Memo.
Teacher's going to take care of Ova until then.
Of course I am.
Why are you doing this, Dad?
I'm going to take care.
Lingo lingo!
Bottles.
We're almost there, Dad. All right?
Ova, we should go now.
Ova.
-Dad, don't. -Come on.
Ova, Ova! Memo's child Ova!
Dad, don't. Why are you sad?
You don't separate children.
-Why are you doing this, Dad? -Come on, Ova.
We'll come again.
-Come on, Ova. -Let Ova stay.
Okay, Memo. She can come back anytime. I'll sneak her in.
I want to go too.
-Memo, don't make this harder. -I want to go too.
Dad, don't be sad. Don't do that.
-Ova, come on. -I don't want to!
-Don't, Dad. -I don't want to!
I don't want to be an angel!
-Dad! -Who's going to take care of Ova?
I don't want to.
Ova, come on. We'll come again.
Me execution.
Me execution.
Teacher.
Memo execution?
Dad execution?
No.
No, Dad said it wrong. Not execution.
Not execution.
Dad is good man.
Dad is good man.
Come on, Memo.
Come on.
-Come on, son. -Get up.
-Come on, Memo. -Come on.
Come on. Good boy.
Memo?
Get up, son.
Come on.
Come on.
I'm going to tell you two things, Ova.
The first one is about truth.
You know the birds
that your father runs after?
They aren't flying to Heaven.
They come in the summer,
and leave in the winter.
The second one...
is about your father, Ova.
Whatever they say,
whatever they order,
whatever punishment they give,
your father is a good man.
Remember that.
Your father is a good man.
Give me your blessing, son.
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
Come, son. Come with me.
Come on, this way.
-I forgot to kiss your hand. -All right.
Okay. Come on.
Come here, asshole.
Maybe I should stay here.
-Come on. -I should stay.
-Here, huh? -Come on, Memo.
I should chop onions.
Ova?
Are you up? Come.
Come here.
You're going to be cold.
Come with me.
Come.
Good morning, Ova.
The man who sent you this...
TWO DAYS EARLIER
Look, Yusuf Ağa.
You've really gone crazy staring at that stain on the wall!
Keep it down!
Listen to him!
He's right.
Is this the solution?
Yes it is!
What's he saying, Hafız?
Be quiet, Askorozlu. God give me patience!
For the first time...
I saw my daughter in my dream.
For the first time.
That...
was my final word.
Come in.
Warden.
Askorozlu wants to talk to you.
About what?
It's urgent, Warden.
Yusuf Ağa sent me.
I'm his messenger.
Faruk, say something, for God's sake.
This is the most ridiculous plan I've ever heard.
Yes.
Me too.
Don't go crazy.
It's a sensitive issue.
-It's been sensitive for years, sir. -Pray that there's a soldier here.
Enough!
I need both of your help.
What's going on?
The left and right wingers, sir.
It's big this time.
Send everybody there.
Everybody. You too. Quickly!
Guards, you too. Come on!
Quickly! You too!
Thank you, Askorozlu.
Thank you.
My Ağa.
You...
You are uniting a father and daughter who don't have anyone else.
The place of a man who does this...
is Heaven, whatever his sin may be.
Thank you, brother.
Thank you.
Give this...
to Ova.
I have nothing else of value.
Thank you, Warden.
Thank you.
Give me your blessing.
It's yours.
No, don't tie his hands.
Let's go, Prosecutor.
We can't wait any longer.
But the Prosecutor and the Colonel aren't here yet.
It's almost prayer time.
He escaped during last night's chaos.
Start a search, immediately.
He can't be far.
Go on.
Come on, come on!
Alert all near stations, at once!
Where is he?
I hid him in the back of my vehicle.
We should hurry.
The man who sent you this...
also sent you your dad.
Lingo lingo!
Bottles?
Ova!
Dad!
Jump, jump!
Jump on Dad!
Dad is a horse!
We're here!
We're here!
Go fast!
Come on, very fast!
Memo's child!
-Where did you come from? -Turkey.
-Why? -To escape police violence.
-Who's that? -My dad.
He looks funny, what's wrong with him?
The soldiers did it.
Good girl.
Nail.
She...
shouldn't say soldiers.
She should say there was a clash between rival groups or something.
Faruk, is that what you're worried about right now?
Captain.
Come on, someone will see us.
All right, come on.
Say hi to my friends!
Quiet!
Where are we going, Ova?
No, Grandma.
It's missing something.
Well, Jules, like I always say,
"When in doubt, add glitter."
You were right! Now it's beautiful.
Just like you.
Children, my name is Glinda Stanwyck,
and I love Christmas so much
that I created this entire holiday village for you and your families to come and enjoy.
for you and your families to come and enjoy.
But it's getting late, and you don't wanna miss
the Christmas tree lighting ceremony, do you?
No!
All right then! Chop chop!
MAN: There she is! Look!
WOMAN: They're gonna light the Christmas tree. Let's go see!
MAN: Come on, let's follow.
-WOMAN: Merry Christmas, Glinda! -CHILD: Merry Christmas!
Okay.
Wave at the camera, darling. When you're not here,
I can watch this and pretend that you are.
I love you, Grandma!

Merry Christmas, everyone!
Merry Christmas!
Thank you all so much for coming
to tonight's Christmas tree lighting ceremony.
All right, everybody, on the count of three!
ALL: One, two, three!
CHILDREN: Merry Christmas!
This is so awesome.
I'll never forget it.
And I'll never forget you.

This is Jules.
Yes, all media have the press release.
#WearRedGoGreen is officially trending.
Perfect. Bye.
Ho ho ho ho. I think we can wear red.
Yes! Go green!
Now through Christmas, any customer wearing red
will get a green reusable coffee mug.
Bring it back to any Nickerson's location coast to coast,
and your coffee refill is half-price.
It's Nickerson's way of saying
"Ho ho ho!" to their customers
and to the environment.
For News 8, I'm Hudson Goodell.
Megan, back to you.
And we're clear.
- Jules, how you doing? - Good.
- Good to see you. - That was great. Thank you.
The place looks fantastic. Jules is here.
Hi.
Pardon me.
Jules.
Thank you for all of your tireless work.
I mean, I had high hopes for this campaign, but I must say
I am thrilled.
It is better than I could possibly have hoped for.
Well, that is my job, Ms. Nickerson,
to exceed expectations.
Well, you're darn good at it.
In fact, I was just singing your praises to your boss
when you came in.
That was very nice of you.
Oh, and while you're here,
I wanna get a picture of you at the big event.
Do you ever stop working?
I'm gonna take some time off over the holidays.
- Tim, Ms. Nickerson. - Ma'am.
I wanna get a picture of her with the customers.
- No problem. - Great, thank you.
I know exactly where I'd like it. Over here.
Oh, hey, Jules,
if Nickerson's Coffee can ever help you
as much as you've helped us, please,
do not hesitate to pick up the phone.
I just might take you up on that.
I hope you do. Merry Christmas.
I hope you do. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
- So, Tim? - Yes.
Uh, let's set up the shots
so you can see the menu as well as the employees
and all the happy customers.
Merry Christmas.
You've reached Mitchell Johnson.
Leave a message at the beep.
Mitchell, where are you?
You said you'd be here. Text me your ETA.
So... did you get stood up again?
No.
No, Mr. Hobbs.
Mitchell said he'd be here. He promised.
You hit a home run with this campaign. I mean, you never fail us.
I mean, you never fail us.
I'm beginning to think you're some kind of branding genius.
Thank you. And you're kinda promoted.
How does "Executive Vice President of Brand Strategy"
sound to you?
That sounds fantastic.
And you know the best part? No more globetrotting.
Yeah, you finally get to call New York City your home. Ah! [laughs]
Hey. Getting a cab was nuts.
I got your text.
Sorry I missed the coffee thing.
I got caught up with a client. How'd it go?
Pretty well. I got promoted.
- Wow! That's-- That's great. - Yeah!
Executive Vice President of Brand Strategy.
"Executive Vice President of Brand Strategy."
You still have no idea what I do, do you?
- You... - Mm-hmm.
You develop brand identity
through the eyes of the customer.
through the eyes of the customer. Cheater.
Cheater.
Well, hey, maybe now you can buy that condo
you've been eyeing on West 80th.
I got a promotion. I didn't win the lottery.
Well, congratulations.
Thank you.
Mm!
No more traveling.
I can finally unpack my suitcases
and live like a normal human being.
I hope this doesn't screw up your vacation time.
No, I still have the time off,
but they want me to hit the ground running first of the year.
Good, because I've got some news too.
How would you like to spend Christmas in Aruba?
Aruba?
Yeah, a client of mine has a place there,
and he was so thrilled with our last deal
that he offered it up to me for the holidays. We leave next week.
We leave next week.
I guess I won't unpack.
Uh, while we're gone, you might wanna think about
holding your mail, as well.
It's just junk mail.
Subscription to The New Yorker expired.
I never had time to read it anyway.
Did you see this letter? I don't know. Who's it from?
I don't know. Who's it from?
A law firm, marked "Third notice. Urgent."
I think opening someone else's mail is illegal.
I know. I'm an attorney.
What is it?
Well, it appears you've inherited a house
from a Ms. Glinda Stanwyck.
Oh. That's Grandma Glinda.
She died when I was in Poland, remember?
Well, I think you should go take a look at this property,
see what kind of shape it's in.
I'll push Aruba a week.
I think the sooner you take a look, the better.
No. Why can't I just go after?
Well, legally, you've only got nine months to claim it,
otherwise it goes to probate the first of the year.
Who knows? You might be able to sell this thing,
make a nice little profit.
Let me see that.
"House and surrounding compound."
- I don't believe it. - What is it?
I inherited Christmas Land.
Jules Cooper, I presume.
Guilty as charged.
Hi. Tucker Barnes. You must be the caretaker.
You must be the caretaker.
Oh, no, not exactly.
I'm the estate attorney with Barnes and Bantley.
My boyfriend's an attorney
and, well, you just don't look like an attorney.
I will take that as a compliment.
Nice to meet you. Likewise.
We actually had a heck of a time tracking you down.
Sorry. I have been traveling for work,
and I can barely keep up with my emails,
much less snail mail.
Ah, life in the fast lane. I understand.
Things are a little less hectic here.
I remember.
I used to come every year when I was little.
I know you did.
You do?
I was in the crowd one year
when Glinda had you light up the tree.
Really?
That's amazing.
Well, welcome back to Christmas Land.
Do you want me to show you around?
Sure.
And the Christmas tree farm, who does that belong to? You.
You.
Wait, I thought it was just Grandma's house
and these buildings.
No. Everything the eye can see from here
belongs to you now.
Do you want me to show you the house now?
Yeah.
Like a picture in a storybook.
It's been closed up for the last couple months.
As you can see, everything was pretty much left intact.
Grandma.
Are you okay?
Just miss her.
Why'd you stop coming to visit?
When I was 12, my dad got transferred,
so I wasn't able to make it back as much.
She came to visit us instead.
- Where are your parents now? - Seattle.
Could use some dusting.
Yeah, and the village could use a little paint here and there,
and most of the attractions need maintenance.
But, you know, with a little TLC,
I think the place could be as good as new.
Ta-da!
Cute.
So are you interested?
Oh, absolutely.
- Yes, I am really glad I came. - Great.
I'm just wondering how long it will take to sell.
Sell?
Is that a problem?
No, no.
It's your right, of course.
It's just that, well, when the town heard
that Glinda's granddaughter was inheriting the place,
I think that we all hoped that...
that you might open it up again
and run it like your grandmother did.
Me?
No. No, no, no. I-- Well, I actually just got promoted.
I-- Well, I actually just got promoted.
No. I'm a city girl now.
But, I mean, this place is great.
It's just as wonderful as I remember it.
Yes, it is.
But I'm still gonna sell it.
- Yeah. - Yeah.
Let me show you the rest of the place.
Hey, what's cooking? Hey, Tucker.
Hey, Tucker.
You must be the granddaughter.
That would be me. Jules Cooper.
Honored to meet you.
Uncle Frank is the caretaker here.
Ah. It's an honor to meet you too.
I thought this place was closed.
This time of year, we sell Christmas trees,
thanks largely to Uncle Frank.
You're the spitting image of your grandma when she was young.
She's gotta be smiling, looking down at you right now.
It's a great thing, you being here.
- Uncle Frank-- - Opening this place back up,
getting her going again like it was in the glory days.
Uncle Frank--
It's gonna make so many people in town happy.
Okay, um... I'm just going to stop you.
I'm not going to reopen the place.
Well, that's what you said.
I never said that.
I said that maybe she would...
I said that maybe you would.
She's not moving to town.
No, I'm not. I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, have fun telling that to everybody in town
whose Christmas you just ruined.
Uncle Frank, I--
- Unc-- - You know what?
I can possibly find a buyer who might wanna reopen the place.
I'll keep that in mind!
Mm-hmm.
Believe me, I didn't tell people
you were gonna open up the place again for sure.
But you told them I might.
A guy can hope, right?
You have to understand that--
I do. It's... It's just people around here
have a tendency to jump to conclusions.
I can see that.
Look, I know how special this place is,
and I can see how much potential it has.
Totally! And right now we're only selling trees.
When Glinda was in her prime,
and this place was going full blast...
You know, he's right. You actually do look a lot like her.
You actually do look a lot like her.
Oh, is this her?
Gretchen, Eloise, this is Jules Cooper,
Glinda's granddaughter.
Oh, I used to work in the bakery,
and I just want you to know I am ready to bake again.
- Welcome. - Ladies...
And I used to work in the ice cream parlor,
and I know what it's like to get a place going again.
So whenever you're ready,
I am available when you need me!
She has her eyes.
Don't you think she has her eyes?
- Oh, she has her eyes! - Yes!
Well, thank you.
You are quite the welcoming committee.
We thought since you're opening up the place again
that you deserve the red carpet tre--
that is, the red velvet cupcake treatment!
No. Um...
See, I think there's been some sort of miscommunication.
Ladies, gather up your treats because we've been tricked.
- Tricked? - Tricked?
She has no intention of opening Christmas Land back up. Well, what is she doing here then?
Well, what is she doing here then?
If you're not gonna tell 'em, I will.
I'm gonna sell the place.
Told ya.
Sell it? Hmmph!
Or rent it maybe.
You see, I don't live here.
I have a job and an apartment in New York.
Well, la-dee-dah.
I guess the bright side is, we don't have to get
any of the attractions ready in time for Christmas now.
Okay, well, this has been fun.
I'm sorry. They just got their hopes up.
I think we all got a little carried away
with a trip down memory lane, but let's get real.
If I'm gonna sell this place, I need to claim it first, right?
Right. I have the papers at my office. Great.
Great.
And just your signature here to make it official.
I'm glad you had the paperwork drawn up and ready to be signed
because I have a lot going on back in New York.
I can't take on anything else right now,
especially this close to Christmas,
so selling it...
does make the most sense.
Yes. You have said that.
A few times.
Well, I don't think you'll have much trouble.
Over the years a lot of people made offers to Glinda,
but she never sold. Why not?
Why not?
They always had their own ideas, and it was important to her
that Christmas Land stay the way it is.
Or was.
You know, I guess I... could,
I mean should...
clean the place up, right?
If I'm gonna sell it,
then a buyer needs to see it in its best light.
You think it's difficult for people to see its potential?
Well, I can see it, but...
some people need a little more convincing.
Yes, some people do.
Hey, hon, here's Mr. Barnes.
Hello, Mr. Barnes. I'm here from St. Ed's
to ask if you'd be willing to make a donation
to our annual Christmas show. Oh.
Wait a second. Are you her?
Her who?
The Christmas angel lady
who's going to reopen Christmas Land?
- Listen-- - Yes.
What?
I am going to reopen Christmas Land.
I'm going to reopen Christmas Land!
You're gonna do what?
I am going to reopen Christmas Land.
I'm gonna get the whole thing up and running for Christmas.
Are you nuts?
Christmas is in a couple weeks, and we're going to Aruba.
We can go after Christmas and then stay through New Year's.
So you're gonna stay there for Christmas?
Yes! Prospective buyers need to see
the full potential of this place.
That's why I have to reopen it.
- I'm not following. - I'm in marketing.
Picture it.
You are showing a potential buyer
this beautiful winter wonderland
all decked out in ivy and mistletoe,
the smell of gingerbread and peppermint fills the air.
Carolers serenade you, all the while,
passing acres and acres of Christmas trees.
Wait, wait. Wait a second. Did you say acres?
I thought it was just this old house and a row of little shops.
It's like 200 acres.
200?
Mitchell, are you there?
Yeah, yeah. Uh, you know what?
Have that lawyer email the paperwork,
and you stay there and make the place look presentable.
Just leave it to me, Mrs. Claus.
Santa is gonna deliver you a buyer by Christmas Eve.
Talk to you later, babe.
There you go.
Thank you for letting me use your office.
Well, thank you for changing your mind.
Do you know how far it is to the inn?
The inn?
That's where I'm staying tonight.
No, no! Christmas Land is yours now.
Uncle Frank and those nice ladies you met,
they're cleaning up the place as we speak,
getting ready for you to move in tonight.
Here we are.
Goes without saying, all this is yours too.
So what do you say? You gonna move in?
No.
I mean, I don't think so.
All I'm concentrating on right now
is getting Christmas Land up and running again ASAP.
Well, your grandmother loved this place.
It's a far cry from the city.
And that's why I love it.
Doesn't get too quiet for you?
I guess it's a bit slower, but that doesn't bother me.
You like things slower?
I like to enjoy myself.
Everyone's always in such a hurry.
Comes a time in your life when you have to slow down,
decide where you want to call home, right?
So you have everything you need here?
Almost everything.
- Oh, I gotta get this. - Yeah.
- It's my boyfriend. - Ah.
Yeah.
Hi, Mitchell.
Hey, babe. So how's it going?
Fine, but hold on a second.
I'll just be a minute.
No, no, no, that's okay. You talk.
I'll come by tomorrow at 9 a.m., pick you up,
show you the rest of the property
and help you get started fixing the place up.
Night.
Bye.
Who was that?
Tucker.
Tucker?
Yeah, Tucker Barnes, the estate attorney.
Wait, Tucker Barnes is the attorney?
What?
Do you know him or something?
I went to law school with a Tucker Barnes, if it's the same guy. How old is he?
How old is he?
Um, our age. Brown hair, your height.
- Athletic build. - Yep.
That's him. He was, uh...
He was what?
He had a reputation.
Are you jealous?
Jealous of Tucker Barnes? Give me a break.
I know. Give me a little more information about this place.
Everything okay?
It's actually amazing.
It would be a great place to raise a family.
Yeah, if you're into that kind of thing.
"That kind of thing?"
Well, what I mean is if you're able to sell this place,
you might be able to make an amazing investment in the city.
Maybe that dream condo on the upper west side?
- Yeah. - Well, you get some sleep,
and I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Good night.
'Night.
What have I gotten myself into?
- Good morning. - Oh, morning.
Tucker stopped by on his way out last night and asked me to get you breakfast this morning at 8:30.
and asked me to get you breakfast this morning at 8:30.
Well, you didn't have to do that.
I gotta eat too.
And it's just as easy to cook for two as it is for one.
- Well, thank you. - Mm-hmm.
So do you live here too?
Yes, there's a guesthouse behind the gift shop.
I squat there from time to time.
I hope that's not a problem.
No.
No, not at all.
Jules, I wanted to apologize about yesterday and how harsh I was.
Tucker said that you're gonna be
opening up the old place again.
Morning!
Oh, this is cozy.
Yeah, um... [clears throat]
You know what? I, um...
I'm gonna just go get ready and shower and, you know, just--
You just, um...
- Shovel the walkway. - Yeah, yep, yep, okay.
10 minutes!
Amazing.
Nice coat.
I found some of Grandma's clothes.
What? You don't think it suits me.
No, I-- I love it.
It's fitting,
especially now that you're running the place.
So how was your sleep?
Okay, once I fell asleep.
It's really quiet, which kind of freaked me out.
Freaked you out?
Not a lot of sirens here.
I'm used to sirens.
I like sirens.
Don't sirens usually mean someone's hurt?
That's not what I meant. It's just...
I have a lot on my mind with fixing this place up and Aruba--
Yeah, you seem a little vexed.
- Vexed? - Yeah.
- Vexed. - Oh.
Can you promise me something?
Depends on what it is.
Look...
I do still plan on selling this place.
Oh, now I understand why you're vexed.
But I also still plan on reopening Christmas Land.
I do. I just don't everyone to get down and out and like that,
like it's the last Christmas or something.
Well, if you sell the place, it is the last Christmas.
You see? No. I have a plan.
- Lying to everyone. - No!
If everything goes the way I think it will,
I'm pretty sure I can find a buyer for this place
who will keep it open for good.
But not you.
Tucker, I have a life and a job in New York.
Right. The sirens.
Okay, will you help me?
How can I help?
Just... go along with it.
Keep everyone's spirits up.
Seems like you're the one that does that anyway.
What makes you think that?
First impressions.
Come on. Just help me.
I'm really not that good at lying to people.
It's not lying!
It's just, um, withholding the truth.
What is it you do again for a living?
I'm Executive Vice President of Brand Strategy.
Ah. You make stuff up.
You wanna show me the rest of this place?
Come on.
So here we are at the barn.
Okay.
TUCKER: Well, this was probably
Christmas Land's biggest attraction
JULES: I remember.
TUCKER: But as you can see...
it's...
Missing a wheel.
Yeah.
You'll probably wanna leave this particular project
to whoever actually buys the place.
You don't think I can fix it?
[laughs] Uh, no.
And even if you could,
I think it would take a level of commitment to Christmas Land
that I just don't think you have.
Coming?
So, Frank, what's the damage this year?
25.
25. No problem.
Best trees in town.
- Yeah, they are the best. - Here you go.
You have a Merry, Merry Christmas, okay? Merry Christmas to you, Frank.
Merry Christmas to you, Frank.
JULES: You make your customers pay right on the spot?
Yeah, what's wrong with that?
That's just shortsighted.
Make 'em pay in the gift store.
When they're in there, they might find some ornaments
and things to decorate their trees,
and on the way out, smell the cookies from the bakery, buy a dozen of those.
buy a dozen of those.
Huh. That's not a bad idea, actually.
It's what I do.
So you spend quite a bit of time here.
Not a lot going on in the office this time of year?
Hey, I'm working.
I'm showing you around your property.
Oh, that is until you sell it to the highest bidder.
Stop!
You don't have much of a sense of humor, do you?
I have a keen sense of humor, and I sense none.
But not a bad gig, right? Showing me around?
Ah, I'm still making up my mind.
Honestly, I like to try to get out here as much as I can,
especially this time of year.
And as high maintenance as you are--
High maintenance?
Yes! You can't sleep without sirens.
You are definitely high maintenance.
But what I was trying to say is...
glad you're here.
I wasn't here last Christmas, and this gives me a good excuse.
Well, I'm glad I could help.
These trees are gorgeous.
They're missing something though.
- They are? - Yeah, don't you remember?
Some of the trees were decorated with ornaments
that the kids made?
Oh, yes!
Crafty Christmas Club.
And when you said you were reopening the place,
I thought you might wanna bring some traditions back,
so I took some liberties.
What kind of liberties?
Come on, I'll show you.
Oh, kids, this is Ms. Cooper.
Jules.
This is the lovely young lady who is going to reopen Christmas Land!
who is going to reopen Christmas Land! Yay!
You know what? Maybe you would like to show 'em how it's done.
Huh?
Making ornaments.
Well, I-- I couldn't.
No, that's a great idea.
Show us how it's done, queen of Christmas Land.
Oh, yes.
And I'm so glad you changed your mind.
What do you think of this, Ms. Cooper?
Well!
I think it's pretty great.
Is it finished?
I don't know. I can't decide.
Well, my grandmother always used to say,
"When in doubt, add glitter."
How do I do that?
[laughs] I will show you!
So you're gonna take this brush, brush the glue on...
She has a way with the kids.
You take the glitter and just sprinkle it on.
And then blow off the excess.
She's quite the girl.
I know what you're doing.
What?
I'm just missing work,
walking a lovely young lady around Christmas Land all day.
Oh, wait. That's what you're doing.
Thanks, Ms. Cooper.
My pleasure, sweetheart.
It's gonna be beautiful, just like you.
JULES: Bye!
Are you okay?
I should have had photographers here. What?
What?
I should have had photographers here for this.
The place wasn't ready. I wasn't ready.
Things need to be cleaned and fixed.
What are you talking about? The kids had a great time.
Well, I'm sure they did, but there's a lot more work to do.
You haven't seen anything yet.
They created a Christmas monster.
♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪
You know, I could throw some trash on the ground
and make it feel more like home, if you like.
Oh, you would do that for little old me?
George.
Tucker.
George, I want you to meet the young--
You must be Jules Cooper.
I can't tell you what a great thing you're doing.
Reopening Christmas Land?
Best news we've had around here in a long time.
Well, actually, that is why I'm here.
- I need some paint and-- - Sure, sure.
Anything you need, and it's on the house.
Has anyone ever told you
that you have your grandmother's eyes?
I've been hearing that a lot lately.
It's fitting that Glinda's granddaughter
would swoop down like some kind of Christmas angel
and save us again.
- Again? - Yeah.
That place out there is a real shot in the arm.
Businesses in Fox Valley were closing left and right.
Then Glinda opened Christmas Land
and saved my store.
Heck, it saved the whole community.
Let's go get you some paint.
Hey, so what did he mean,
that Christmas Land saved the whole community? Well, like most people around here,
Well, like most people around here,
George has a tendency to exaggerate a little bit.
But Christmas Land made people feel special.
They're proud of it.
It's something for them to feel good about.
You know, get behind the town.
It's kinda like a mascot or a...
Symbol.
Yeah.
Sometimes a symbol is all you need.
♪ It's a winter wonderland ♪ ♪ So Merry Christmas ♪
How much do I owe you this year, Frank?
Don't handle payments out here anymore, Gary.
You gotta pay at the gift shop.
- New owners, new policies, huh? - Yup.
But this is one policy I think you're gonna like.
Since you're buying a tree,
you get 25% off any tree decorations or lights.
Really? That is a darn good deal.
Thank you kindly, Frank.
Merry Christmas, Gary.
- Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas.
Well, I gotta hand it to you. You were dead right.
Through the eyes of the customer.
The key to a successful business plan.
So this is what you city slickers call a soft opening?
Yep! You open up the doors a few days early,
iron out the kinks, and then you have the grand reopening gala.
Gala. We're not in the city anymore.
We don't do galas.
I do galas!
Don't worry. Plenty of eggnog.
No champagne.
Place looks pretty great.
What's it like here in the offseason?
Well, it's a bit quieter.
I worked here as a kid in the summers.
Doing what?
Growing Christmas trees with Uncle Frank.
It's a Christmas tree farm, Jules.
So you planted all of these trees.
No, not all of them, but a lot of them.
Ah! See that patch over there?
Planted those.
Those are scotch pines.
- What about that one? - You tell me.
- How am I supposed to know? - You need to know this stuff.
I don't think that's necessary. If you're gonna be running the place.
Only for a couple of weeks.
Oh, yeah. I keep forgetting.
I think the Christmas tree farm is doing just fine without me.
Well, don't forget, the trees are the heart of the place.
- All this other stuff, it's-- - A brand, Tucker.
Speaking of which...
- I'm fixing this! - Jules!
Look around! This is a great business,
and it's finally becoming a great brand.
This is the final touch, and it's gonna be so sweet.
- You're going to fix this? - Mm-hmm.
What do you know about carriages?
A lot, actually, thanks to this place.
My grandmother taught me how to care for the horses
and maintain the carriage.
Came in handy too.
One summer, I worked in Central Park,
driving a carriage.
- You're kidding. - [Jules laughs]
What? You think you're the only one
that worked in nature during the summers?
Oh, Central Park is nature now?
What exactly happened to you in the city, by the way?
Were you mugged or something?
There are lots of nice things to do in the city.
Pass me those tools, please.
And I have nothing against the cities.
They are great places to visit.
I just don't wanna live there.
Somebody broke your heart.
Let's just say that the breaking was mutual.
You know, she didn't like the snow,
she didn't like the leaves, she didn't like the rain--
So seasons then?
[laughs] Yeah, yeah, I guess.
My parents moved to Florida a couple years ago,
my brother lives in San Diego.
Everybody I know is just so over the cold.
And I know this sounds strange, but...
the cold keeps me warm.
Does that make sense?
What about you?
What about me?
Why don't you buy it?
Well, pro bono work doesn't exactly pay that well.
Which reminds me, I have to get back to the office,
wrap up the year-end stuff. Whoa!
You're not gonna stay and watch me fix this thing?
Watch you?
You know if you asked nicely, I could help you.
I can fix it fine without you.
I just thought you'd enjoy the lesson.
You're going to give me a lesson.
Class is about to begin, Counselor. Oh! [laughing]
Jules?
Mitchell Johnson?
I fell.
Are you okay?
Oh, I'm fine. No, I mean what you're wearing.
Well, actually, this is my...
You look like a hobo.
...grandmother's.
Anyway, it's great to see you.
Um, so what are you doing here?
I have the same question.
Tucker Barnes. Can't believe it. Though I'm not surprised to find you in a barn.
Though I'm not surprised to find you in a barn.
Nice to see you, Mitchell.
Funny story, actually.
Mitchell told me that he went to school with a Tucker Barnes.
I wasn't sure it was the same guy.
It's a small world, huh?
It's too small.
This is your boyfriend, huh?
So, Mitchell, um, what are you doing here?
I've got some business in Chicago,
so I thought I'd come by and check out this place of yours.
MITCHELL: Wow. This is pretty amazing.
It's beautiful, right?
Think you're gonna make quite the killing.
Ah, same old Mitchell, I see.
You know, you're just in time for the grand reopening.
Mitchell, it's gonna be amazing.
Really just want to see the property.
Well, you could try opening your eyes.
Maybe it's time for a private tour?
- Yeah, sure. - That's all right.
- Yeah, sure. - That's all right. I have to get back to the office anyway.
Where's that, the barn?
Nice seeing you again, Mitchell. Jules.
Jules?
let me finish showing you around.
What's the deal with you two anyway?
With me and Tucker? There's no deal.
I just never really liked the guy,
always talking about his hometown.
Kinda crazy that this was the place he was talking about, huh?
Yeah, it is.
Sad, actually.
So listen, I, uh--
Sorry. It's hard to talk to you with that coat.
Jeez!
I'll take it off.
Scrooge.
So listen, I didn't want to say anything earlier,
but I've got a meeting with a guy who wants to buy this place.
Already? But I haven't even shown it.
I told you that I would find someone by Christmas.
Sound good?
Yeah.
Yeah, that sounds good.
This guy that I have lined up
has actually been to Christmasville.
Christmas Land.
There are signs all over the place.
Right. Same thing.
Anyway, he said that if Christmas Land... Thank you.
...was for sale,
then he would definitely be interested.
Well, what do you think?
It's not really our thing, is it?
I mean, we can leave the sticks for guys like Tucker, right?
You know, the grand reopening is tomorrow.
It might make a great presentation for this guy.
Do you think he could come on such short notice?
I know that he's really busy right now.
That's why I had to line up this meeting in Chicago for tomorrow.
Why don't you come with me?
This guy is gonna keep it open, right?
- What do you mean? - Christmas Land.
I just wanna make sure whoever winds up with the place
is devoted to it.
That's why you should come with me and ask him yourself.
I told you. I have the reopening tomorrow.
But I could do a lunch meeting the following day in Chicago.
He seemed pretty excited,
so yeah, pushing it a day might be a good move.
Make him want it more.
All right, I'll see what he thinks.
Think there's any bears out here?
Maybe, Mitchell.
Maybe.
JULES: We worked very hard to get Christmas Land open again.
REPORTER: So what inspired you to open this place back up
after so much time?
Well, aside for my grandmother, of course,
I would have to say that people in this town
really inspired me.
TUCKER: Your grandmother would be really proud of you.
Thank you.
And you know, your cookie looks a little sad.
Maybe you should add some sprinkles or frosting.
Or not, because this is my design.
Oh, well, I'm just trying to help. Oh.
So where's your boyfriend?
Chicken out?
He had to go to Chicago on business.
That's a shame. I was looking forward to catching up.
What is your problem with him?
I don't have a problem with him at all.
I think you found yourself a very special guy.
But I don't think he ever got over the fact
that I graduated first in our class.
Wait a minute.
He told me he graduated first in his class.
Is that what he told you?
No.
Are you kidding me?
I think you two make a good match.
In the way you were talking out there with the newspaper,
you really had me going.
What are you talking about?
"Oh, well, the people in this town really inspired me."
If I didn't know the whole story, I would've almost believed you.
I wasn't...
Tucker, I meant that.
Okay, children, time's up.
Stop decorating your cookies.
Ms. Cooper, will you do the honor of picking a winner?
Ohh! Does that mean I have to disqualify my own design?
Oh, I'm afraid so.
And what about me?
Mr. Barnes, unless you're under the age of 12...
Okay.
If I must, then judge I shall be.
But I am warning you kids, I am not easy to please.
You can say that again.
You know, if I were judging, I would pick yours.
JULES: Okay.
I have made up my mind.
And the grand prize winner is...
Joey and his marshmallow snowman cookie!
Congratulations.
No disrespect to Glinda,
but I think Christmas Land is better than ever.
Oh, thank you.
Hi!
You, uh, you startled me.
I take it you're not coming to the s'mores campfire roast.
I hate to sneak away like this,
but I promised Mitchell I'd sit down with a buyer in Chicago.
Buyer. Right. Well, have fun.
Tucker, it's just one day. Will you cover for me, please?
Do you realize that in all my years practicing law,
I have never been so dishonest in my entire life?
I know for people like Mitchell and you, lying comes a little bit easier,
lying comes a little bit easier,
but I have a harder time with it.
Is that really why you're upset?
I'm not upset.
- You seem upset. - I'm not--
Why would I be upset? You're gonna sell the place,
you're gonna move back to New York,
everything's gonna be fine.
Everything is gonna be fine.
That's why I'm going to Chicago to make sure of it.
Okay, then go.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Good luck.
Don't worry.
♪♪ ["Deck the Halls"]
Excuse me.
I don't miss that.
What? People actually on their way somewhere?
Is that what that was?
You've been out in the wilderness too long.
I gotta deprogram you.
Here you go.
- Thanks. - Thank you.
You look amazing, by the way.
Lot better than the other day, right?
Mitchell.
What? I just said you look amazing.
Thanks.
You gotta admit, this is a lot more civilized
than hanging out in a barn, right?
You might not want to trash the place
when you're trying to sell it.
Oh, there he is.
- Mitchell. - Mason.
Mason Richards, Jules Cooper.
Ms. Cooper.
I don't know if Mitchell mentioned it to you,
but I'm very familiar with Christmas Land.
I took my own family there years ago.
It truly is a marvelous place.
And your grandmother was the owner?
Yes. Yes, she was.
What can I say?
I love it, and I want it.
Just like that?
Don't you at least want to see it first?
Don't need to. But--
Why don't you tell me how this sounds?
I'm willing to pay you $1.7 million right now,
provided you sign this contract.
Now you and Mitchell can start your lives out right.
Did Mitchell tell you how important Christmas Land is?
He didn't have to. What I mean, Mr. Richards, is...
What I mean, Mr. Richards, is...
this is my grandmother's legacy,
and I have to be sure whoever buys it won't tarnish that
and, well, destroy the place.
Jules, as long as I've known you,
you've always wanted to live on the upper west side,
live by the park.
That used to always just be talk.
But now, thanks to your grandmother,
that could be a dream come true.
What better legacy is there than that?
Mr. Richards...
No one will take better care of it than me.
I can assure you of that.
If it makes you feel better,
I'll take over the first of the year.
Congratulations.
You are now a millionaire. Wow. [laughs]
To Christmasville.
Christmas Land.
Thank you.
And this guy, he really seems to love this place.
I'm just-- I'm so excited and honestly relieved.
Everything is going to be okay.
I'm really happy for you, Jules.
I really care about this place a lot.
And it's gonna be here now, and I'm gonna come and visit.
You're gonna move back to the city,
and you're never gonna come visit us.
That's not true.
MAN: Oh, I think they're over here.
- Hi. - Hi.
Are you lady who reopened Christmas Land?
I am. Actually, it was my Grandma Glinda's place.
Well, we certainly appreciate it.
I grew up in town and...
Christmas Land was always one of my favorite childhood memories.
I'm just so happy my daughter Emma
will get to share that too.
We're looking for the best Christmas tree,
but there are so many different kinds.
Yes, there are. It's really hard to choose.
What's this one called?
It's the Colorado Blue Spruce.
They're not as popular as they used to be
'cause the needles are really prickly.
But smell it.
Ah, it smells like Christmas!
Daddy, I want this one.
Okay, sweetie. That one it is.
- Hey, thank you so much. - My pleasure.
All right, let's go find the man with the saw.
See? I do care about this place.
Very much.
Just makes it harder to see you go.
Howdy! Come on in.
I have every ice cream flavor known to mankind,
and then some.
I'm looking for Jules Cooper.
I'm Jules.
I'm Walter Hayes.
I work with Mason Richards.
Why don't we go outside?
Right this way.
Sorry. I haven't announced the sale yet.
I'm waiting till after Christmas.
Are you the new groundskeeper?
Ah, no. I don't see that happening.
This is 206 acres, right?
- Yes, exactly. - Do you know this property
is centered perfectly between two interstates?
It's perfect for commerce.
Well, yes, we actually get quite a bit of church traffic.
There's gonna be a great deal of competition for the lots.
The lots?
Real estate development.
What's to develop?
With a property like this, the possibilities are endless.
And we could put an industrial park right over there.
I predict if you come back in five years,
this place will be completely unrecognizable.
Are you okay? You look like you're gonna be sick.
I think I am.
Excuse me. I have some business to attend to in Chicago.
Hey. I specifically told you
I wanted a buyer who would not destroy Christmas Land.
What are you talking about?
Some developer. Said he worked for Mason.
Mitchell, they're gonna sell the land.
They're gonna chop it up and sell it into lots.
What does it matter? We're gonna be in New York.
You knew.
Didn't you?
Didn't you?
This was the fastest and easiest way.
I really don't see what the problem is.
And that, that right there, Mitchell,
that is the problem!
That is a huge problem!
Okay, calm down.
- You lied to me! - I didn't lie to you.
I just...
I withheld the truth.
I want out.
What?
I'm not selling.
What are you talking about? You sold.
Well, there has to be a way out.
Babe, it doesn't work that way. You signed a contract.
Look, if you have any feelings for me at all, you owe it to me to fix this.
you owe it to me to fix this.
And as your attorney, I advise you to not do anything
that will upset this opportunity for you to become a millionaire!
And what do you mean, if I have feelings for you?
'Course I have feelings for you.
I love you.
I don't.
I don't love you, Mitchell.
What do you want, Jules?
I don't know anymore, but...
I know I don't want you.
All you care about is money.
And I want out of the deal,
and I'm gonna figure out a way to get out of it.
- Jules. - I'm gonna fix this.
You can't fix this.
It's not broken.
It's just done.
Goodbye, Mitchell. Have fun in Aruba.
I'm sorry. I tried to stop her.
It's all right.
- Have a seat. - I'll stand.
What seems to be the problem?
Well, one of your employees paid me a little visit.
Yeah. Seems like you're planning on developing the land.
It's what I do. I'm a real estate developer.
See, I was under the impression
that you loved Christmas Land.
I do.
And it's not like I'm gonna roll a bulldozer through the place
on January 1st.
But that land has a lot of potential,
and eventually, I'm gonna have to just let the market decide.
I don't wanna sell it.
Ms. Cooper, you don't seem to understand.
You've already sold it.
Now, I don't know what you've heard, but...
Yes, I plan on selling some lots on the edge of the property.
But I have no intention of touching
your grandmother's house or any of the buildings in the village.
Yeah, right.
Well, not at first.
The Christmas tree farm is a business.
It employs a lot of people,
and the town really cares about that place.
Please.
I am begging you.
All right, this is what I can do.
You have $1.7 million right there.
You scrape up another 1.3 by Christmas,
I rip up the contract.
What are you saying?
I'm saying I own the property.
A property, let me remind you,
I've had my eye on for quite a while.
But I'm willing to flip it.
Flip it?
Sell it back to you...
if you can meet my price: $3 million.
And I'll give you till midnight, Christmas Eve.
TUCKER: Jules...
I don't even know what to say, but...
what have you done?
Did you read the entire contract?
I mean, there's gotta be a way out.
[sighs] Remember what I told you
about people coming around over the years, but your grandmother never sold?
but your grandmother never sold?
Yeah.
Mason Richards was one of those guys.
I really wish you had checked with me before you signed this.
No, no. There's got to be something that I can do.
Jules, stop. It's done.
It's done.
You know, I believed in you.
I really thought you were committed to Christmas Land.
Tucker, I was!
I am!
Christmas Land is history.
Enjoy your apartment next to Central Park.
Ladies and gentlemen, our sweet Jules Cooper is here now.
- Jules! - Come on up!
Also, I would like to say that I am so happy and grateful
for everything that our little Christmas angel has done
for Christmas Land.
And I said it before, and I think it bears repeating:
Christmas Land is better than ever.
- MAN: Yeah! Welcome back! - [cheering continues]
I just wanna say how proud your grandmother would be of you.
Eloise, thank you. I...
Uh, actually, uh...
there is something that I need to say. Uh...
I...
I haven't been entirely honest with you.
When I first came here,
my intention wasn't to move here and run the place.
My hope was that I would make it attractive enough
for someone to buy it so that I could go back to my life
in New York.
But something happened.
I fell in love.
I fell in love with this place,
and I fell in love with all of you.
But I sold it.
- You sold it? - I didn't mean to.
I thought that I was selling it
to someone who would keep Christmas Land open,
but it doesn't appear that that is what he is going to do,
and I'm just...
I'm just so sorry.
I am still trying to get out of the deal, but I...
I'm sorry. I'm-- I'm really sorry.
Wave at the camera, darling.
When you're not here, I can watch this
and pretend that you are.
I love you, Grandma!
CROWD: One, two, three!
- [line ringing] - Come on, pick up.
- Pick up. - Hello?
Oh! Ms. Nickerson?
Um, it's Jules.
So I guess you can say I'm calling in my favor.
Jules, once again, your pitch doesn't disappoint.
This Christmas Land place sounds wonderful.
It really is special, Ms. Nickerson.
Well...
you've always delivered for us.
I think this time I can deliver for you.
I can gladly provide you with $850,000 in advance
for the exclusive right to serve Nickerson's Coffee
at Christmas Land.
850,000.
Look, I know you needed more,
but you're catching us at year end.
I mean, my cash flow just can't handle any more than that.
- I'm sure you can understand. - Yes, of course.
No, I do. I'm-- I'm thrilled.
Great. I'll get the contracts out to you in the morning,
and I can wire the money in the afternoon
before the ink is even dry.
I cannot begin to tell you how much I appreciate this.
It's my pleasure.
And it's good business.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
It's not enough. I need 450,000 more.
GRETCHEN: Well, you can knock me over with a feather.
I thought you two lovebirds would be picking out china patterns by now.
china patterns by now.
Yeah, well we had an argument.
I said some things I regret.
Honey, romancing has its ups and downs.
All you gotta do is say you're sorry
and then let the makeup smooching begin.
Hey, Uncle Frank.
Just saw Jules. She's in the barn.
Well, stop moping and go apologize.
Apologize? She should apologize to me!
She never should've signed those papers.
She didn't know that man was such a scoundrel.
You should ease up on her a little bit.
The poor thing really seems to be trying to make things right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can't believe it. You--
You did it.
Not quite.
But I-- I tried, Tucker, I really tried,
and I came close.
What are you talking about?
I raised 850,000.
Jules, that's amazing.
To be fair, it all came from one company, but there's a catch.
but there's a catch.
We are contractually obligated
to sell Nickerson's Coffee here now.
At least until we close, which barring a miracle
will probably be at midnight tomorrow.
Well, while there's still time,
isn't there anyone else you can call?
I'm gonna try a few people, but it doesn't look good.
And I am all out of ideas.
The carriage looks...
It looks amazing.
I was gonna get two horses
and drive up to your office door
and tell you that I raised all the money
and Christmas Land was gonna stay open.
That would have been one heck of a show.
Yeah.
I'm really sorry, Tucker. ♪♪ [light piano]
TUCKER: Well, looks like tonight
will be the last Christmas tree lighting ceremony.
Déjà vu.
I remember the last time
it was the last Christmas tree lighting ceremony.
You know, which reminds me...
I still have some Christmas shopping to do.
Uncle Frank!
This is quite a stash.
Everybody has a stash for a rainy day.
Everybody.
What are you doing here?
It's Christmas Eve.
This seems to be the place to be.
And I have to hand it to you.
You've really done amazing things here.
I remember it being quaint, but nothing like this.
Bravo.
Well, if you like what I've done,
is there any chance you might keep it as-is?
Or lower the asking price?
After all, it is Christmas.
[chuckles] Ah, Jules.
I admire your tenacity, but a deal's a deal.
I think I gave you a relatively reasonable opportunity.
I'm sorry, but your time has run out.
Yeah, I know.
Well, I'm gonna get back to packing my bags,
since this isn't my place anymore.
Good night, Mason.
- Evening, Tucker. - Mason.
Long time.
Look, I'm glad you're here. There's something I want to talk to you about.
You're not coming downstairs?
I don't think I'm wanted.
Come on. It's the Christmas tree lighting ceremony.
And thanks to me, it's the last one.
That's okay.
Why don't you come downstairs with me?
Guys.
Tucker, what's going on?
You'll see.
And what are you still doing here?
Okay, we're all here.
Jules, we wanted to thank you
for everything that you've done for this place.
No, I don't think you understand.
I was unable to raise the money.
Yes, but...
we were.
What? TUCKER: All of us. It occurred to us
that if we really want to save Christmas Land,
well, maybe we should do our part.
After all, Christmas Land saved us once.
You're darn tootin'.
So we all decided to chip in ourselves
to save Christmas Land!
How much did you raise?
Well, that's why I asked you down here.
Do you still have that commitment
from Nickerson's Coffee?
I do, but I'm still $450,000 short.
Well, there is $450,000 in that box,
if you would do us the honor of accepting it.
Well, I will accept...
this $450,000...
from you sweet, generous people...
...on one condition.
It is a loan,
and I will pay back every penny as soon as possible
from the profits of Christmas Land
with interest.
Take it or leave it.
Sold!
I will write you a check for the rest
if you will kindly tear up that contract.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Well, do you think Glinda would approve?
I know she would.
I have one more surprise for you.

-Okay, Doctor. -This is the current dosage.
-Okay. -Then this, and--
Doctor, when will he regain consciousness?
Maybe now, or maybe never.
Asking the same question repeatedly won't change my reply.
Dear, why are you so worried about this patient?
How are you two related?
My life depends on his survival.
Run, Adi! Run!
How's that!
Yes!
We are awaiting the umpire's decision.
They need 10 runs in two balls.
-Two balls, 10 runs. -We can see...
I dare you to win.
I won the moment I thought about it.
Go, it's time to bowl.
-Go, bowl. -Aditya Singh is ready to strike!
Both the bowler and the victory belong to us.
-Yes, brother. -Go, bet on the team.
Okay, brother.
Let's see if Adi can achieve the impossible.
All eyes are set on Adi.
Adi is thinking.
Aditya Singh is about to strike. Bilal Afroz is bowling.
That's a beautiful cover drive.
Everyone in the stadium is...
You know why I hit a 4?
Why?
Let me enlighten you.
Because hitting a 6 on the last ball is always sweeter.
Brother?
He is the deadliest bowler in the IPL.
Kohli, too, respects him.
I don't see this boy respecting anyone.
-You... -The much awaited
Chandigarh versus Mohali match.
-Stadium is packed. -He has set the field for a Yorker.
Is it?
-I would like to thank our sponsors... -Go back.
...for this huge trophy.
He is bluffing.
It's said...
He'll throw a bouncer.
Go for it.
We want a sixer! We want a sixer! We want a sixer!
Brother, our money...
That was a huge six!
They were left gawking.
I gave you money to lose the match.
But you used your memory to win it.
You did offer me the money.
But I thought
that it would be quite insulting to lose.
-So, I chose otherwise. -What about
the insult brother had to face?
Well, brother should forgive me. I'm just like his little brother.
In that case you should lick the dust off my boots.
What say, boys?
Yes!
Then I might forgive you.
Here you go!
Hit me.
You got insulted because of me, right?
Then you should insult me too. Fair, don't you think? Okay?
What say, boys? Okay? Fair is fair.
Right, brother?
Here, use this to buy a balm.
Your hand will ache at night.
Omi!
Adi!
Get up!
It's noon.
Your brother has called you. Come on, get ready.
It's too early, Uncle. Who gets up at 12?
Come on now!
Even the worst slackers wake up by 12.
You aren't worried about your future at all.
Listen, get his clothes ready.
You are late.
I just put all his clothes for a wash.
-Oh, no. -You're always in a hurry.
They are all wet now.
It'll at least take one week to get all of them back from the laundry.
Come on, you are going like this.
-Like this? -Yes.
Why don't you get it?
Raman said it's urgent.
Uncle, I have promised both my sisters
that I won't leave without seeing them.
I'll leave once they are back from school.
I see.
Seeta, Cheeta?
Yes, Dad?
You didn't go to school?
Aren't you worried about your future?
It's Sunday, Adi bro. Wake up!
Sun... Sunday?
Yes.
Do you have any other excuse?
Let me think.
Give me Rs. 10,000.
Rs. 10,000? No, I don't have Rs. 10,000.
It's a fair price.
-I'd have given it to you if I had it. -Listen?
You had kept this in the cupboard.
Why did you get this?
Give it to him. What if he doubles his demand?
Hey!
MAKEWELL HOSPITAL AND TRAUMA CENTER
It's been a while since I was home.
My brother raised me after our parents passed away.
My brother is my life.
He used to be like a father, from Mondays to Fridays.
A buddy on Saturdays.
And a pampering mother on Sundays.
He used to make me drink four liters of water to avoid a hangover.
Bloody emotional fellow.
Then on one dark moonless night,
an evil witch took over my brother.
My brother's wife. Avni Devi.
The most gorgeous villain in this world.
I have never come across someone with such an aura.
She took over as soon as she came.
They say men change after they get married.
It is so true!
My brother changed the very next day.
It's empty.
-You must have some cash on you. -See for yourself.
She made me beg for every penny.
The minute my pocket money disappeared, so did my love for my brother.
Madam was taking over.
And I was petrified,
as she was better than me.
I have no idea about Bat Woman or a Superwoman.
She was Thunder Woman, who had taken over my house!
Hey, careful!
What's wrong, Adi?
No... nothing.
I decided to leave the house.
I gave them an ultimatum that I am going to Uncle's place.
I knew my brother would rather die than let me leave.
Take a train, flights are expensive.
Today, he finally wants his brother back.
Just wait and watch, he'll be excited to see me.
Brother!
Oh, you are back. You took your own sweet time.
Aunt said you left in the morning.
How are you, Adi?
I'll serve lunch.
I had something important to discuss with you.
Awesome! Straight to the point, huh?
Can I go freshen up, if you don't mind?
-Hey... -I hope that's okay with you.
Listen, I called you here because...
I am starving.
-Listen to me. -Can I eat first?
Hey.
You must be tired. Go to sleep.
We can talk tomorrow.
Hello! Why tomorrow?
Come on, out with it. I don't have time to waste.
Don't be stubborn. You must be tired. Go to sleep.
Tell me now.
Now means now.
Your sister-in-law has got transferred.
Yes, Avni has got transferred.
She's leaving!
Madam's leaving!
Welcome back to bachelorhood, bro! The warden is leaving.
Listen...
Fridays will be movie nights.
Booze all day on Saturdays.
And on Sundays...
Hear me out.
Speak your heart out, bro. You'll get anything you want, today.
It's a done deal.
-Done deal! -Listen.
Tell me.
-You and your... -Me and my...
-You... -Me....
You are going to Dhaamli with your sister-in-law for two months.
Hey, Adi!
Are you alright?
Are you my brother or the worst disaster of my life?
I am sending you with her to avoid any disaster.
You've your college friends there.
There is no way I am going there. Let me tell you, I am not her servant.
I would've gone with her if I wasn't supposed to go to Bangalore for training.
I am not going with her and that's final.
Fine.
I have always tolerated your whim and fancies.
I have fulfilled all your wishes.
Today, for the first time when I need you...
Well done, kiddo! You've matured well.
Well done.
What a mind job!
You've managed to learn both,
taunting and emotional black mailing in a span of two years.
What other choice do I have?
I'll go.
You want me to leave now?
Should I?
I'm leaving.
Let me warn you, I want mint fresh bills.
Please.
Hello, ma'am. Welcome.
Adi!
Adi! Bro!
Stop!
"Hello, ma'am?" Seriously?
Come on Bro, she's Raman's wife.
She's our sister-in-law, right!
Forget that, meet my cousin Darshi...
Chandel. I know.
Once I see someone...
Once I see someone... I never forget him.
-Right. -We know.
-You've been saying that since college. -Correct.
I saw your Three Idiots on Instagram stories.
-Losers! -Come on.
Careful with that.
We met once when I was a kid.
You haven't changed much.
Why bother adding milk to the tea?
Green tea? Damn it.
Aunt, please have green tea.
Good morning, ma'am. Umesh.
Umesh Sharma. I know.
This way, please.
-Good morning, ma'am. -Good morning.
The Commissioner has asked for you.
You got transferred here all of a sudden.
I, too, was informed at the last moment.
Umesh told me that you would like to take a tour of the territory.
So, let me tell you,
you don't need to visit Raiganj, Kanakpur, Ilda and Vaghra.
I have already inspected these districts. They're good.
Thank you for the update, sir.
You can go.
Okay.
Good day, sir.
-Umesh? -Yes, Madam?
Start the car, I'd like to begin my inspection.
Sure, Madam. Where would you like to start?
Raiganj, Ilda, Vaghra and Kanakpur.
What if the Commissioner objects?
You can say that you are following my orders.
-Hello? -Hi!
-How are you? -Much better.
How's Adi?
Adi, it's Raman.
Water the plants as well.
It's a beautiful shot down the ground. The match has taken an exciting turn.
Elections are on in full swing. All the parties...
-You have to come to work on time. -Okay.
You have to do everything I say, without making a face.
Okay.
If I like your work, I'll hike your salary by 200 bucks every month.
-Okay. -Adi?
-Who is she? -Er... She is a maid.
Come here.
She will handle all the household chores.
She will water the plants, get groceries, dry the clothes.
She will do everything. Say it.
Yes, I will do everything.
See.
But it's just the two of us here.
We don't need a maid.
We can handle the chores on our own, right?
Say thank you and send her away.
Madam says that you need to know English.
Adi, don't forget to hang out the clothes for drying.
No, mister.
Madam said no need for two servants in the same house.
He is here.
Sushma.
Look, the slacker is back.
Adi!
Aunt, Madam has ruined my life!
Huh?
What happened? Tell me everything.
She enjoys the luxury of an air-conditioned office,
and makes me do all the household chores.
All of this is part of a servant's job.
She's treating me like a servant!
Please! Please save me.
I already did.
Come over.
I'm coming!
Yeah, Apple? I have a new design idea for the next iPhone.
Let's call it Lemon.
Yellow is the color of the year.
I can see it coming towards me.
I mean...
Yeah, yeah, I am working on it.
Ideas?
Yes, in fact it's coming to me as we speak.
-Excuse me? -It's here only.
Excuse me?
Yeah?
I like you a lot.
Will you marry me?
Move!
Listen?
Hello!
No!
Hey, you are the one who is in love, not me.
He's done for!
Totally done for!
This is what happens in love.
You don't even need lemon wedges with your drink.
Good point.
If I were a girl, I would never hit on me.
But this girl is all in!
She wants to marry me!
Awesome!
-Don't you think that's a tad too much? -Too much indeed.
-Right? -Got to say, she's got a bad taste.
This is crazy, man!
Totally crazy.
Yes, Aunt?
Adi, you didn't come over?
Well, I caught a fever on the way.
Fever!
Did you see a doctor?
The doctor in fact came up to me.
Slick!
Don't worry about money.
I'll transfer some.
Yes, transfer 10,000.
I need it for the treatment.
Ask Avni to take good care of you.
Oh shit! Madam!
Lock?
She locked me out?
Hey, Bro!
Let's split.
I want my share.
What are you saying, Adi? What's wrong?
What's wrong?
I had two drinks and your wife locked me out!
She makes me do the laundry.
I have to wash the colored and whites separately.
I have to chop onions every day.
Finely chop them.
To add insult to injury, today a maid called me a servant!
Call your wife!
Call her right now!
Tell her that I am at the door.
Who? Your kid brother!
Adi! Calm down.
Listen, also tell her that I am not scared of her.
Am I scared?
No, I am not scared.
No!
B-Brother!
No, I have reached home safely.
You don't need to worry.
Fine.
Have some water and go to sleep.
Sweet dreams.
Strange.
The spare key.
8801674774.
My phone number.
I heard you have a good memory.
Memorize it.
She's training me to be a servant but asking me to apply at the CID
No chance!
Won't you fill the application form?
Of course, I will. I will completely fill it.
Make sure you throw the trash outside.
"Make sure you throw the trash outside!"
Once I get a hold of my brother...
Bus!
Don't you think that the girl needs to work hard too?
I am a catch.
To propose at the first sight?
You should've put in some effort, you're Adi after all.
Hey! Stop the bus! Stop the bus!
I knew that you'd be here.
I, well...
Do you behave like this with every boy or I am special?
You are special.
I knew it.
We can get married on Friday; I have a day off in college.
Are you an alcoholic or a drug addict?
A love addict!
Natasha, come on! Hurry up!
-I'm coming! I'm coming! -Hang on!
Give me your number. I'll call you. Hurry up!
-Hurry up! -982039845...
The last number is 5.
Bye, cutie!
There she goes again!
You know how bad the traffic is?
Right.
Hold on, guys.
-I'll be damned! -Shit!
Answer it! Answer it! Answer it!
Hello?
Natasha.
Natasha who?
The one you wasted your day for, in anticipation of her call.
Oh!
You are the one who wants to get married and ruin your life.
Too late, it was love at first sight for me.
-Oh! -Did you get your eyesight checked?
Hello, you turned around when you saw me!
I could see it clearly.
By the way, have you ever experienced love at first sight?
There is a chance for love at third sight
if you meet me right now.
Come and get me, if you want to meet me right away.
Send me the address. I am already on my way.
Find me and I'll tell you.
I see.
Fine then, get ready, I am coming.
See you, beauty.
See you, cutie.
Awesome, Bro!
"See you beauty", huh!
How do you plan to find her?
UP 02 8181.
Check the route of this bus.
B. Tech.
Find out the number of engineering colleges here.
"I was crazy to opt for imprisonment?"
Do we have a prison around?
A prison?
-No prisons here, just a hostel. -Name?
Rawalji Nene Woman's Hostel.
Hi!
How did you find me? I thought you'd lose.
I won the moment I thought about it.
Go back now.
What?
If I get caught on my way back, I will start staying at your place.
-My place? -Hmm.
I didn't doll up to go back.
-Hmm. -Let's go.
Where to?
I am new here. I don't know...
Don't worry. You have me. Just drive.
Open it!
Good morning, sir.
Why do you keep doing such things, sir?
You are about to become an MLA.
This doesn't suit you.
No one can kill me.
Tell him, Priest.
It's all in the stars.
His horoscope states that no one can kill him.
We found the Major, Bro.
Hello, Major.
Thank you.
Vikramjit Bisht.
I know.
I also know why you are here.
You seem to know everything.
What else do you know about me?
Your ancestors reigned over Dhaamli during the British era.
And now, you want to reign over Dhaamli through politics.
By promising to turn Dhaamli into Shanghai,
you are contesting in the election to become an MLA.
You have around 1,000 cabs running in the city under the brand, Super.
Half of them don't even have a license plate.
Once you become an MLA,
you might stop following rules altogether.
You set buses on fire as they are the preferred mode of transport.
Stop the bus! Stop the bus!
No one steps outside!
You bribe the corrupt officials,
and get the honest ones transferred.
No, no, no. Transfers aren't always possible.
Then you get rid of them.
You set a bus on fire three months ago
to ensure that people would choose to travel by your Super cabs.
Forty people were burnt alive in it.
I have all the evidence to prove their murder.
That's what you are here for.
Right.
Give me the evidence and end the story.
How can I just end the story?
How?
That day, it was not just 40 people,
but 40 families that were ruined.
I had a daughter.
She was coming back home to celebrate getting a job.
She never reached home.
Papa! Mummy!
Help!
Mummy!
Do you know how traumatic it is,
to look for your daughter in a pile of dead bodies?
It must have been so painful.
I can understand.
Things you just said have touched my heart.
Tipu?
Yes, bro?
Make sure the Major isn't harassed or troubled.
Collect all the evidence from him and let him go.
During the war, I continued fighting in spite of losing a leg.
That's what I intend to do now as well.
As long as I am alive,
I won't let your dream of becoming an MLA come true, Vikramjit.
You shouldn't say such things about someone's dreams, Major.
It's a sin.
You are the one who is a sinner!
Forget about being an MLA.
You will be the reason for your own death.
Fine then, let me shoot myself.
Tipu, will corruption end if I shoot myself?
No, bro.
Will poverty get eradicated?
No, bro.
Will this old man get his daughter back?
No, bro.
Will I be able to become an MLA?
No, bro.
And what if this old man dies?
Then you'll surely become an MLA.
The one who tries to defeat me, loses their life.
Speak without hesitation.
I don't want Natasha to stay in a hostel anymore.
Her warden is complaining about her.
She will go turn worse if she stays there.
That warden isn't a saint either.
Look at her!
Some of your good habits will rub off on her if she stays with you.
That's why I brought her here.
My house is her house, Uncle.
Get your bags.
Okay?
Avni?
Yes?
You have been married for two years now.
When are you planning to have a child?
You always smile when I ask you this question.
Here comes the slacker!
Did you get a job?
Or you are still loitering around alone?
Why alone, Uncle?
I'm loitering around with my hot girlfriend.
Of course.
If I were your girlfriend's father, I would certainly ask you.
Do you plan to make her stay at your brother's place as well?
Who knows? If her father isn't a miser like you,
he might perhaps let me stay at his place.
Shall we go now?
Yes, please!
Some people have the habit of showing up uninvited.
Adi, my cousin Nikki will be staying with us henceforth.
So, two extra tomatoes, two extra onions,
an extra bowl of lentils and veggies, six extra flat-breads,
and some extra washing powder for the clothes every day.
Money?
Add 100 for the petrol as well.
You'll be dropping her to college every day.
And yes, she'll be staying in that room from now on.
Tell her that you'll be taking her to college.
So, basically what madam said was,
"Listen up, you freeloading driver!
You used to be my servant up until now,
now you shall serve my cousin as well."
If this is how she behaves, there isn't much that I can expect from her cousin.
Forget it! I am not even interested in looking at her.
Hello, listen, I am waiting outside. Come quickly.
I don't have time to waste.
Get down!
I said get down!
The first time you touched me, I thought, it's okay,
it happened by mistake, it won't be repeated.
The second time you touched me, I knew,
that you have malicious intentions.
As soon as a boy has a girlfriend,
do all girls get a message saying, "Attack"?
They all attack him at once and render him useless.
The poor boy is left with no choice.
He loses his home and his buddies.
He ends up losing his girlfriend too.
So, you better get this straight.
I have a girlfriend.
I love her a lot.
You can check my social media if you want.
I might look like a slacker, but I am a decent guy.
So, you may sit down if you can keep your hands to yourself.
If you cannot then please take a bus, there's the bus stop.
Go!
Mind the gap!
Place your bag here. Place your bag between us.
This is Natasha's college.
Yes, Uncle?
Think twice before making such a big decision.
Times are bad.
I have already decided, Uncle.
Fine.
I'll come there and get the papers signed.
Okay.
Please come over tomorrow.
If you don't get me a vegetable cutter by tomorrow,
I will end up at your place, got it?
Hey!
What are you doing here!
Avni's sister is at home.
-Can we meet later? -I want to meet Avni's sister, Adi.
Please leave. You can meet her tomorrow.
Avni will kill both of us if she sees you here.
Kill me and keep her?
Why? What's so special about her?
Hey you, number two!
Step out I dare you!
She's a coward. She prefers to stay inside!
Please leave!
I won't leave. Let me go.
-She sells vegetable cutters. -Hmm.
Huh?
What's going on, Nikki?
Sister, he wanted to know how to buy a vegetable cutter online.
A vegetable cutter?
We have two knives at home.
Why do you need a vegetable cutter?
Hello?
Yes.
Nikki?
Hmm.
-Madam's sister? -Hmm.
-You played such a big game with me! -Hmm.
I had told you,
I'll start staying at your place if they throw me out of the hostel.
Oh, I see!
I know when I discovered you.
When did you discover me?
At Avni's wedding.
That's when I saw you first.
-At Avni's wedding? -Such a cutie!
At Avni's wedding!
Your Dhoti kept slipping and you didn't know how to fix it.
I fell in love with you in that moment.
Everyone said, "Adi is good for nothing."
"We'll need to find a girl who'll always look after him."
That's when I decided that I'd always look after you.
Why didn't you tell me back then?
You wasted two years.
Don't worry, you have two whole months now.
Tell me, what's your plan?
What if I kiss you?
-I'd love that. -Really?
-Yes. -Sure?
Yes.
You call that a kiss?
How about another kiss? A real kiss?
Just like the ocean That kissed the sky
Together through the moon And the stars we fly
Hold on to my hand As I take you high
You're my destination In the morning light
Take you high
I belong to you You own me
I am all yours
I have nothing to call my own
I belong to you You own me
I am all yours
I have nothing to call my own
My breath belongs to you
My words too
You have changed my life
Who am I without you?
I am just nobody
You are my heart You are my heartbeat
Who am I without you?
I am just nobody
You are my heart You are my heartbeat
Just like the ocean That kissed the sky
Together through the moon And the stars we fly
Hold on to my hand As I take you high
You're my destination In the morning light
I cannot sleep at night
My heart is confident
Love is responsible for my plight
I swear every time
I meet you I feel
You are the only Right in all the wrongs
Who am I without you?
I am just nobody
You are my heart You are my heartbeat
Who am I without you?
I am just nobody
You are my heart
You are my heartbeat
Just like the ocean That kissed the sky
Together through the moon And the stars we fly
Hold on to my hand As I take you high
You're my destination In the morning light
-And the traffic here? -Okay.
-Umesh, stop that vehicle. -Okay, madam.
-Okay, madam. -Please.
-Stop! Stop! Stop! -Stop the car!
-Stop! -License?
-Please step outside your vehicle. -What's wrong?
No car should be allowed.
Sister!
Don't worry, I've got your back.
Registration Certificate?
What are you two doing here?
Well...
My bike broke down.
-Right. -So, we took a Super.
Yes, sister.
You know his bike is a wreck.
It always keeps stalling.
Can I go in your car, instead?
That's an official vehicle.
Take a rickshaw.
Let's go.
That's an official vehicle?
-Stop! -Let me talk to her.
Madam, how dare you make my passengers leave before checking my documents?
-What's your vehicle's license number? -Can't you see?
What's your vehicle's license number?
2844.
If your car's registered as 2844 then what about that one?
-Umesh? -Yes, madam?
Seize both the vehicles.
Okay, madam.
Hey, madam!
Do you know who these Supers belong to?
He will soon become an MLA.
Check each and every Super.
Okay, madam.
Don't you get it, madam?
You're doomed if Vikramjit Bisht learns about this.
What was the name you just mentioned?
Vikramjit Bisht.
You heard that, Umesh?
-Yes, madam. -Issue a notice to him.
Let's go.
Came here begging for my vote, sonny boy?
Tell me, why didn't you show up
when my uncle passed away?
Well fine then, let's do one thing.
You too shouldn't show up when my uncle passes away.
Just make sure that you vote for me.
VOTE FOR V.I.B
Okay, you are forgiven. You have my vote.
-Thank you. -God bless you.
Thank you.
What is it?
The new RTO lady has seized some of our cabs.
She wants to shut down our business.
You cannot handle such a trivial matter? You are nothing but talk.
-Advocate, call the Commissioner. -Okay, sir.
Sir.
Welcome, Your Highness.
You have managed to ruin our bread and butter as soon as you arrived.
What is the problem with you women, huh?
You want to shout slogans! You want to protest!
Why don't you just stay home and cook!
Have some.
I don't eat while I am on duty, sir.
I eat anywhere and everywhere.
-Umesh! -Yes, sir.
Where are the chilies?
I'll get them right away, sir.
"I'll get them right away!"
Release the Supers you seized yesterday.
Supers have jammed the State Transport, sir.
They want everyone here to travel in Supers.
When Public Transport objected,
they set a bus ablaze on the highway.
Forty people died in that incident, sir.
I have checked their history.
If you had thoroughly checked their history, you would know
that anyone who raises their voice against Vikramjit becomes history himself.
People's lives are at stake here, sir.
I'd pick my life over others, got it?
I am just doing my duty, sir.
Then do it right.
Your duty is to follow your senior's orders.
I want all the Supers back on the road by tomorrow morning. Okay?
Where's my tea, Umesh?
I'm getting it, sir!
Do you want it in writing?
Now I won't release those Supers even if you give it to me in writing.
Have a good day, sir.
Madam is home.
Madam is home, huh?
Crazy girl!
She's going to get me into trouble.
Hey!
What's wrong with the electricity...
Madam!
-Madam... -Hold me tight, cutie.
Madam is here, beauty.
I don't care.
Madam is here, beauty.
Huh?
Well, she got scared of the dark and hugged me.
Right.
See, the power supply is restored. You had no reason to be scared.
Don't waste your time, Adi.
I sent her back.
You should first concentrate on your career.
You have the rest of your life to fall in love.
Got it?
Huh?
Uncle!
Not bad, young man.
Woke up early today?
It's so nice to see you disciplined.
None other than Avni can bring you back on track.
Here, some snacks. Your aunt has sent them for you.
-Please come with me. -Hmm.
UP 100 ALWAYS AT YOUR SERVICE
What are these cops doing here?
That lady officer has filed a case and issued a warrant against us.
We will get our vehicles back, sir,
but this case can put your MLA seat at risk.
He is right, Mr. Vikramjit.
Now only you can handle that lady officer.
Fine.
I'll get going now.
Why don't you stay for another day?
I need to submit these papers.
-Fine. -I'll have to leave today.
Adi, drop uncle at the railway station.
-See you. -Bye.
Why do you seem disturbed, Adi?
Nothing. It's nothing.
Come in.
Please have a seat.
Hello.
Vikramjit Bisht, from Supers.
Hmm.
Please have a seat.
Thank you very much.
Would you like a cup of tea or coffee?
Sure, anything you please.
I'll get going.
I'm coming with you.
You?
Why?
Avni will be all alone then.
Let her stay alone. That's not my problem.
What happened, Adi?
That woman has ruined my life.
She values nothing.
She first distanced me from my own brother.
She treats me like a servant here.
When she found out that I like Nikki, she sent her away as well.
She is vicious, Uncle. She is heartless.
This is what happens when you get the wrong woman into the house.
You...
So, ma'am, what can I do for you?
I mean to save my Supers.
Just follow the rules,
pay the necessary taxes,
and we won't seize your Supers.
Is that all? Is it that simple?
This is what you need to do to avoid this from happening in the future.
But I won't be releasing the Supers I have under my custody.
Oh.
Ma'am, around two years ago,
my driver ran over five honest people.
That vehicle is still running on the road.
Ma'am.
Adi.
It was your brother who sent you to me two years ago, not Avni.
He wanted you to stand on your own feet.
Avni wanted you at home.
She is not making you do the chores to treat you like a servant.
She is ensuring that you don't feel guilty of freeloading.
She didn't take Natasha away from you.
She sent her away so that you two can be together.
That's why she asked me to come here.
She wants to talk to Natasha's father about getting you two married.
Right.
And that's why she sold her father's land for peanuts.
So that she can buy you a house.
How much money would make you say yes?
I challenge you to try and buy me.
Everyone in the city knows
that I am going to win this year's election and become an MLA.
Imagine what they'd think
if they find out that I lost to an ordinary lady RTO.
I ask my department to perform their duties fearlessly.
What will they think of me if they find out that I got scared
of a local goon from Dhaamli?
A local goon?
Ma'am, you don't say much,
but when you do,
you tend to go overboard.
She never speaks about her benevolence,
so no one's listening.
Son, we are middle-class people.
Even one additional member imbalances the monthly budget.
Adi, you know what?
When I asked her the reason for not planning a child,
do you know what her reply was?
"Adi is my son."
"I'll think about having a child after Adi settles down."
That will be all.
Have a good day.
She is not ruining your life.
She is just trying to make it better.
Adi,
please try to understand her.
Madam!
Look, what you want is impossible.
It is my dream to become an MLA.
I'll die if my dream doesn't come true.
I will file this case.
So, you want me to die?
Fine then, so be it.
Let me shoot myself.
Tipu, will this world be a better place if I die?
No, bro.
Will Dhaamli turn into Shanghai?
No, bro.
Will this RTO lady get a Nobel Prize?
No, bro.
Adi! What are you doing here?
Uncle told me that you--
And who wins if this woman dies, Tipu?
What did you say?
Who wins
if I shoot this worthless, lowly lady officer right here, Tipu?
The woman you just cursed...
...is like a mother to me.
Boo!
You want to scare me to death, huh?
Listen, the 15th of this month is a very auspicious day.
-For what? -For our wedding.
It hurts to be away from you even for a moment.
So, I told dad that you charmed your way into my bed.
Hence, he is here to talk to sister about getting us married.
Let's go.
Nikki is my only child.
How can I?
If Adi takes up a job,
I can consider getting them married.
And how can I give my daughter to someone who is so hot-tempered?
He has locked horns with Vikramjit.
You think I don't know?
I left her here in your care.
You ruined your little sister's future because of him.
Good job!
-You haven't been a good sister to her! -Enough!
-That's enough. -Adi!
Another word against her and your future too will get ruined, Uncle.
I don't need you or your daughter.
You may leave.
Adi!
Stop it. Please, Uncle.
You said he had stopped fighting.
And you!
Will you leave, or are you waiting for me to get thrashed?
Madam?
I am worried after what happened yesterday.
Vikramjit kills at the drop of a hat.
Adi went overboard and hit him.
Gym membership, keto diet, protein shake...
I will put a stop to everything.
You better bring the two of them here in the next two hours!
-Go! -Sadhu!
-Kariya! Let's go! -Yes, boss.
-Let's go. -Let's go.
He shouldn't have interfered in our professional issue.
I've brought him here to apologize.
Adi, apologize to him.
Sorry. Please forgive me.
You shouldn't have interfered.
What you did wasn't right either.
But today, I am here to make sure that he apologizes for his mistake.
I request you to forgive him. He's young.
Apologize properly, and I might consider forgiving you.
Middle-class people like us get excited over small things.
We get upset over small things as well.
I got distressed when I saw a family member in danger.
I am sorry.
I liked the way you apologized.
You apologized from your heart.
Fine, I forgive you.
But he hit you in front of everyone, and now he is apologizing in private.
And I decided to forgive him nevertheless.
I have no issues with him.
You can take him away.
I hope this ends here.
I don't want this to be a problem in the future.
Rest assured, there won't be any problems.
Have a good day.
Sorry, because of me you had to...
Adi, you don't have to fight my battles for me.
I can fight my own battles.
You should concentrate on your career.
Why did you let him go? We should have shot him dead.
The entire city would realize Vikramjit Bisht's might.
And what it means to mess with him! Shush!
How would anyone know if I shoot him here?
What happened?
Please carry on. I think I forgot the bike keys. Let me fetch it.
You have to defeat your opponent to win the election.
I know how to settle my scores.
I knew that you didn't forgive me when I looked into your eyes.
I thought I should clear this out before I leave.
The way you are staring at me,
it's quite clear that you want me dead.
You are smart.
But you got this wrong.
It's not you, it's your sister-in-law I want dead.
I am the one who hit you, so why her?
You hit me for her. So, you must now endure the pain of losing her.
It will be an apt punishment for you.
Her death will leave you lifeless!
A dogs tail is never straight.
You couldn't accept my apology.
So, let me skip the formalities.
We middle-class people are a little sentimental when it comes to our family.
But I don't think you got me right.
So, focus.
We have a bad habit.
We don't wait for a problem to take us by surprise.
We start preparing much before the problem arises.
Take onions for example.
We buy in bulk when we anticipate a hike in price.
We plan our travel and book tickets three months in advance.
Even the slightest indication of hike in fuel price
causes a queue outside gas stations.
When we are so cautious over such trivial things,
imagine what we would do when our family's life is at risk?
You won't even be able to touch her.
How long do you think you can protect her?
Show some respect.
How long do you think you need to kill her?
I give you 10 days.
It will take you that long?
Are you in a hurry to attend her funeral?
Fine, let's play a one-over match then.
A Super Over. Six balls, six days.
If I don't manage to kill her in six days, then I'll spare her forever.
Done.
The one who tries to defeat me, loses their life.
I won the moment I thought about it.
Wait, sir.
Please wait, sir.
Let me explain, sir.
Please hear me out, sir.
Sir, please!
What kind of a lawyer are you?
That woman came to my house and insulted me,
and you want me to think before I act?
I wanted to shoot her right then and there!
Everyone who stood against you disappeared from Dhaamli, sir.
I just want you to wait until the elections are over.
It might affect the elections if she dies while you are in the city.
Fine.
I am going to Lucknow for two days.
I have a meeting with the Chinese delegation.
I want Avni Singh dead by the time I get back.
Sign here so that we can begin with your training.
You are giving the money you got from your property to this guy?
Excuse me?
The name is Sir. Mr. Sir.
And what if "SIR" shuts shop and disappears with your money?
Hello!
This isn't a bogus money laundering company.
It is a highly reputed software training company.
We give guaranteed results,
subject to you coming here every day for the next 30 days.
No refund if you take even a single day off.
You sold your only property to help me get a job.
I don't think it's fair.
Your future is more important than that property, Adi.
Sign the document.
Over here.
He's a very nice boy.
Very good.
We have an amazing cafeteria.
Quite a few of our students got a job just last week.
Everyone is doing well.
This will be your desk.
Perhaps, you want to do something else with your life.
No matter what it is, you still need to have discipline in your life.
-All the best. -Thank you.
-Bye, sir. -Bye.
Where to?
You have to come here for the next 30 days, with dedication.
-Five days. -Just five days?
It took me 40 days to complete the training.
I need five days off.
No chance! How dare you!
You have to come here every day for the next 30 days.
Today is your first day.
Today is the second day.
Just call and check when he'll be here.
-Bro? -Adi?
-You guys alright? -We are good. Don't worry about us.
Tell me, what's that badge in your hand?
Have you taken up a job?
Yes. It's been 24 hours.
-I've taken up the job of her security. -Security?
I am on duty for the next four days and nights.
Hello?
Adi?
Yes?
Have dinner and go to sleep.
I'll be late.
Okay. Don't worry. I'll manage that.
And don't forget
to shut the windows.
It's locked.
Break the lock.
Two of you guard the door.
Open it, hurry up.
TRANSPORT OFFICE, DHAAMLI
We would've kidnapped his sister-in-law last night.
But he showed up out of nowhere.
He beat us black and blue.
I have seven fractures!
He is dangerous, boss. He beat us to a pulp.
-You need to do something about him. -Yes, boss.
-Tell me. -I had sent our men
to kill her.
They have come back with broken bones.
You thought someone who can dare to challenge me will be an average Joe?
Get this straight, you bonehead,
if you don't get this job done by the time I return,
the consequences for you will be adverse.
-Boss! -Hmm?
What's that stink, boss? Smells like gas.
Raju must have farted as usual.
It's not Raju.
LPG gas.
That's what it smells like.
I knew you'd come in large numbers this time.
I am ready to welcome all of you.
He has leaked a couple of canisters at least.
This place reeks of gas.
Whenever Liquid Petroleum Gas comes in contact with fire,
an explosion is inevitable.
You have time to decide.
I will count to ten.
If you don't move now, there will be nothing left to move.
One...
Two...
He's bluffing.
You and your sister-in-law too will get blown up.
She is sleeping with a blanket that's been doused with coolant.
And I have applied a fire-retardant gel all over my body.
Don't worry about us.
Think about yourself.
Five...
What about three and four, huh?
I forgot in the excitement of setting you guys on fire.
One lunatic sent us here to die,
the other is sitting here, all set to blow us up.
How does one choose between the devil and the deep blue sea?
As soon as the canister blows up, the temperature will rise over 100 degrees.
You will know what third degree burns feel like.
Your skin will start to melt.
Your blood will evaporate.
Six...
I can see that you guys like wearing gold jewelry.
It's a good thing.
It will help your family identify you.
You are surely doomed.
Seven...
We'll get berated if we leave.
And we'll get blown away if we stay.
Shall we leave?
Stay.
I'd love to see you blow up.
-Eight... -Let's go, guys.
What do we tell Vikramjit?
We need to stay alive even if we want to give him excuses.
With Vikramjit, we might still get to see another day.
Scared, chicken?
-Should I get the car running? -Wait.
Nine...
Adi!
Adi!
What happened, Adi?
Nothing. There was a gas leak,
so I turned the main power off and opened the windows.
I had shut the door so that I don't disturb you.
It's all under control now. You can go back to sleep.
Okay.
My dearest brothers and sisters in Lucknow,
I have already started the process of turning Dhaamli into Shanghai.
NEW IDEAS, NEW HOPE VIKRAMJIT BISHT
We will soon launch our Supers in Lucknow as well.
I want you all to remember
just one name before you cast your vote.
The one you love and cherish...
-What happened? -No, let me go.
-Tell me, tell me. -Your future MLA...
-What happened? Please tell me. -Vikramjit Bisht!
Let me handle the...
Sir...
There is a problem, sir.
They...
-Sir! -Sir!
What would you like to say about this?
-No questions, please. -What would you like to say about this?
I'll give you the briefing later. Let's go, sir.
-I'll give you the briefing. -You have to answer our questions, sir.
Take a look at this, sir.
She has exposed Super in the media, sir.
That's the reason the Chinese delegation canceled the contract, sir.
How dare that middle-class lowly lady clad in a cotton sari mess with me!
How dare she! That too in Dhaamli!
I don't care! Damn the consequences!
Have her killed at any cost!
Okay, sir.
He hasn't shown up today?
No.
The name is Sir. Mr. Sir.
He hasn't, sir, Mr. Sir!
Strange guy! He joined yesterday and doesn't show up today!
After what happened last night,
I think these guys need to be taken very seriously.
It's time we got serious as well.
This is where my sister works.
-Okay. -I'll go talk to her about my marriage.
Okay.
-All the best. -Thank you.
-Try to focus. -Biswa, where is Adi?
Tell him to meet me at the hostel.
Why don't you tell him that yourself?
You took up a job for me?
Yes.
Meet me in the evening.
Why?
Today is our love anniversary, stupid.
Two years ago, on this very day,
I saw you for the first time at my sister's wedding.
Today?
I'll wait for you in the evening, okay?
Bye, cutie.
Bye, beauty.
Today is somebody's wedding anniversary.
What is all this, Adi?
Why are you asking me to leave so suddenly?
I suddenly remembered that today is your anniversary.
Brother will be pleasantly surprised when he suddenly sees you there.
That's why I am asking you to leave so suddenly.
But I don't have a ticket, I don't have any clothes.
I haven't even applied for leave. How can I just go?
Here's your ticket.
You can go shopping with brother.
And your leave application is being handled by Chetak.
Where is Chetak? He should have been here by now.
Dhaamli to Lucknow, Lucknow to Bangalore?
Where did you get the money to pay for this, Adi?
Don't worry. I used your husband's money.
I had blackmailed some money out of him when he asked me to come here.
It's so sudden. How will we handle everything?
He's being childish.
I have so much work to do, Adi.
Your child is bound to act childish when you treat him like a child.
Onions are quite expensive. Buy some groceries.
We only have eggplants at home.
-Don't worry. -You can cook them.
Call me once you reach there. Have fun.
Bye!
By the end of this week,
the danger she is in because of Vikramjit also ends.
No one should know that she has left for Bangalore.
No one should know.
But she hasn't left for Bangalore.
There! That's the attitude I want.
-This is right. -Look, she didn't leave for Bangalore.
I am coming there. I am coming there. Wait.
What is my brother doing here?
I didn't call him.
Oh great, Brother is here.
Avni!
Please come.
Avni!
How are you?
I am good.
Hey kiddo!
What are you two doing here?
Well, Adi wanted me to surprise you on our anniversary.
There you go!
And I came here to surprise the two of you.
Avni, meet Vikramjit.
He is a very nice man.
He is soon going to become an MLA.
-Is it so? -Yes.
He video called me. He was singing your praises.
In fact, when he learned that today's our anniversary,
he insisted that he'd pay for my ticket.
But I refused. I could not accept his money.
Well then, I applied for a week's leave and came here to surprise you.
See you. Bye.
Adi!
Please carry on. I'll join you guys.
What?
If the middle-class is sentimental
then the rich act in their own crazy ways too.
We create the problems you face and fight every day.
We hike the price of onions to pressurize your tiny minds.
In spite of the seats being vacant, we don't lower the ticket prices.
To ensure that the fares stay beyond your reach.
Give up or you will lose both, your brother and his wife.
Don't worry.
We'll declare today as the rest day.
Here's an advice for you.
You should shoot Avni.
Or I certainly will.
Here's an advice for you.
-You should raise a dog. -What?
You should raise a dog.
It's better than raising a hand against her.
Chetak!
Please seek your elders' blessings now.
-God bless you. -Stay blessed.
This is such a pleasant surprise.
It's a good thing that she saw me there, Uncle.
Otherwise, I'd be celebrating our anniversary here, and she in Bangalore.
I have to say, you have terrible timing.
You cannot do anything right.
-What did I do wrong, huh? -"What did I do wrong?!"
Why are you complaining, Adi?
You wanted us to be together, right?
You should be happy.
As you say, Sister-in-law.
What?
"As you say, Sister-in-law?'
Hey! What's wrong?
What is it?
You okay?
This is the first time he has addressed me as sister-in-law.
Bloody emotional fellows.
Enough of this emotional drama. Are we going to celebrate or not?
Of course.
Hang on a second. Nikki!

Go for it!
Here's the file on that bus incident, sir.
Madam, buses are bound to catch fire if the passengers in it
carry LPG canisters with them.
Sir, I'd like to bring to your attention
that 20 out of the 40 people
who died in that accident didn't even own an LPG stove.
Out of the other 20, 11 were students and five were children.
That leaves Mr. Roy with four people to base his story on.
I have already spoken to their families.
And that's in my report.
Any questions, Mr. Roy?
Thank you, Mr. Roy.
Umesh, we can send this file to the election commission.
Be careful with it. If we lose this file,
we lose all evidence against Vikramjit and Super,
and I can't take that risk.
Hi!
Vikramjit Bisht's goons have kidnapped me.
They asked me to call you up.
His dagger looks pretty sharp to me.
Should I ask where he got it from?
-Give me the phone. -You...
Listen up.
You have five minutes until I chop her into so many pieces
that it becomes impossible for you to count.
Five minutes.
Let's go, guys.
Hey!
-Run! -Scram!
You!
Phone!
Phone!
Answer your phone!
Phone!
Answer your phone!
Enjoying being a hero, huh?
It's your brother's wife on one hand and your future wife on the other.
I wanted to see
who you would choose to save.
It will take you 20 minutes to get to your brother's wife.
Whereas I'll be there in just five minutes.
Just five minutes.
So, do you plan on hitting Tipu, or on saving your brother's wife?
You better hang up now.
BHARAT TIMES
-What's wrong? -They canceled my leave.
Hey!
Stop!
Sir!
We got an alert from the mobile unit.
Someone has planted a bomb here because you're visiting the RTO office.
The caller asked us to save your life.
Zip it!
Who made this call?
Baby got back, Damn, show them what you got!
Baby got back, Damn, show them what you got!
Baby got back, Damn, show them what you got!
All units come in! All units come in!
Reach RTO office quickly.
Our future MLA Vikramjit Bisht is going to be there in some time.
Someone has planted a bomb there.
Get to the RTO!
Get there immediately.
There is a bomb threat there!
Devil or the deep blue sea, It is going to be a tough choice!
You have a sweet tongue But you are a backstabber
You are a backstabber!
You wanted to make me meet my Maker?
You wanted to pull me down?
You tried your best!
Well, it's my turn now!
Like I said, you cannot even touch her.
Got it? Or do you want me to explain?
Well, it's my turn now!
Sir, I suggest you leave immediately.
Your file is on its way to the election commission.
Well, it's my turn now!
Well, it's my turn now!
Adi? What are you doing here?
-I... -You didn't go to work?
Well, that's why I'm here.
There was some issue with the software.
A serious issue.
-Was it resolved? -Yes.
Well, my bike has broken down.
It will take a couple of days to get it running again.
Can I go home with you?
Hmm. Let's go.
Hello.
At this hour?
I have a test tomorrow.
They are here to help me.
-Yes. -They will study with me, right?
Group studies.
-Good night. -Good night.
-Where is Natasha? -Terrace.
Why didn't you tell me about this, Adi?
If I had it my way you would never have found out about it.
You want to bear the entire burden by yourself?
You should share your troubles with me.
Tomorrow is the last day.
He can target anyone.
None of you get out of my sight.
I don't want to take any chances.
-Yes. -Okay, bro.
Sir, madam can do as she pleases,
but I cannot risk ruffling your feathers.
See, folks like us can still trust the police to help us.
You won the match, bro.
Do you still plan to kill Avni?
I'll make sure that I make a spectacle out of her death.
ADI BRO
Yes, bro?
-Why didn't you answer the call? -Well...
Doesn't matter.
Take this book.
-Okay. -Sit here.
Okay, bro.
-Don't doze off. -Okay, bro.
-Be alert. -Okay, bro.
Darshi!
You dozed off!
I didn't even realize.
S-Sorry.
Shit!
Biswa! Chetak!
Call my sister-in-law! Get up!
Chetak, call her!
Call her!
Sister-in-law!
Biswa, the keys!
Don't tell brother! I know where she is!
Hey!
Where is she, Vikramjit?
Shut up!
You come to my house and ask the question that I should be asking you!
You're dead if there's even a single scratch on her!
You had challenged me that you'd save her.
So where did she go?
Now you tell me where Avni is, or you are dead!
Get her!
-Sister-in-law? -I told you,
I can fight my own battles.
I pay you for a reason! How can she show up at my house!
You ministers are good for nothing!
Avni Raman Singh, IPS.
Indian Police Service.
Or Indian Public Servant, your choice.
This warrant proves
that goons like you aren't meant to become MLAs.
I'll be out in no time.
I guess you don't know that the file you prepared has turned to ashes.
I guess you don't know that your fate has met the same fate.
You better check it out.
It will be the last message you'll be receiving.
Super Cabs' owner, Vikramjit Bisht, who is also contesting in the election,
his video has gone viral on the social media.
This video clearly shows how Vikramjit
killed a retired military officer, Major Yashwant, in cold blood.
Breaking news!
This story began when Major Yashwant
came to the Anti-corruption Wing, Delhi, to file a complaint against you.
A special task force was formed.
Avni, you will go there as an RTO officer.
You must leave for Dhaamli right now.
When you were busy with your rallies,
we were busy investigating you.
Major Yashwant knew that you'd kill him.
He willingly sacrificed his life for justice and left us the evidence.
As for the file you burnt,
I am the one who sent it to you.
A duplicate file.
So that I can personally deliver the original file to the Anti-corruption Wing.
This is what it feels like to hit a sixer on the last ball!
She is like a mother to me.
But for you, she's your worst nightmare!
For the past six days, this slacker has been protecting and guarding you.
Or you would be long dead by now.
I am proud of him.
This boy single-handedly managed to defeat your entire gang.
And you will pay.
You killed a Major of the Indian Army, Vikramjit.
You will get a death penalty.
Your life is over now.
Arrest him.
No! Guns down!
You shattered my dream.
I am as good as dead.
Avni Raman Singh, you remember your full name,
but you forgot about the Raman you use in your name.
You thought we brought him here just for the heck of it?
I have hidden him in a place
where no police can find him.
Only I know where he is.
He was screaming
when I was roughing him up.
He was lying on the floor and begging for his life.
He kept saying, "Help! Help!"
-"Forgive me! Forgive me!" -No.
"Forgive me!"
-Stop it! -Adi! No!
Adi! Stop it!
Control, Adi!
No, Adi!
Stop it!
Don't get so hyper, kiddo.
You were so busy coming after me that you forgot about your husband.
And he was so busy protecting you that he forgot about his brother.
Now this story will end where it had begun.
In this city measuring 1100 sq.km.,
he gets his very own 11 sq.ft.
I don't know how long he can survive without air, food or water.
Where is my brother, you dog!
I know, but I won't tell you.
Everyone will know
once his dead body starts to rot and stink.
You two ruined my life.
Now I will lead you both to your death.
Tipu?
Tipu!
Yes, bro?
Will I win if I kill them both?
No, bro.
Good.
And if I kill myself?
I know, I will die, but I will still win.
Now I'll take the location of your brother and her husband to my grave!
I'll die and be free,
but the two of you will keep missing him
and die a little every day.
Vikramjit!
How can someone who has victory in his name ever lose?
No!
Hey!
No!
No!
-Brother! -No!
-Sir! -Brother!
No!
Advocate! Call an ambulance!
-Move aside! -Doctor!
-Move! -Move aside!
We're losing blood!
Call the doctor! It's an emergency!
Vikramjit! Get up!
-Here, here please. -Open the door!
The bullet has hit the back of his head and he has lost a lot of blood.
The patient is in coma right now.
Very less chances of survival.
Excuse me.
I have hidden him in a place where no police can find him.
Adi!
I don't know how long he can survive without air, food or water.
Everyone will know once his dead body will start to rot and stink.
Will I win if I kill them both?
No, bro.
Where is my brother?
Tell me!
Let's go!
Let's go, boys!
Good morning.
Make sure I get hourly updates on his condition.
-Doctor. -Okay, Doctor.
This is the current dosage.
-Doctor. -And after this...
When will he regain consciousness?
Maybe now or maybe never.
Repeatedly asking the same question won't change my reply.
Why are you so worried about this patient?
How are you two related?
My life depends
on his survival.
Adi, we have looked for your brother everywhere.
-We don't know whether he is alive or-- -Hey!
Shush!
He'll be fine! My brother will be fine!
He'll be fine.
Sister!
I am responsible for this.
I am responsible for all this.
Adi!
Don't lose hope, please.
Look, not Vikramjit,
not your friends, nor I can help you.
Only you can truly help yourself.
Adi?
You never forget anything you see or hear, right?
Go back and try to recall, Adi.
You cannot lose hope now.
Try to recall every word and action of Vikramjit.
Listen to me, Adi, try to recall everything.
Now this story will end where it had begun.
RTO!
RTO is where it all started between me and Vikramjit!
Let's go!
Move!
Adi, upstairs!
Yes.
Brother!
He wasn't talking about you two.
He was talking about me.
This all started from where I seized his vehicles.
Let's go!
No!
Think, Adi, think!
We are missing something!
In this city measuring 1100 sq.km.,
he gets his very own 11 sq.ft.
11 sq. ft.!
-Supers! -Supers!
The four vehicles that I had seized are at the RTO warehouse.
-Come on. -Yes.
Look for the Supers, Adi!
Brother! Raman!
Brother!
Raman!
There are so many cars in here! How do we find him?
Supers?
There are the cars that I had seized.
Check the car where the trunk seems lower due to weight.
-Check these cars now! -Okay!
Quick! Quick!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
We can't waste any time, Adi!
Brother!
There was cement under his boots!
Check over there.
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.
Don't be silly.
It's okay.
Brother!
I am responsible for all this.
Sister-in-law.
Please forgive me.
Hey, I am like a mother to you.
And a son never needs to apologize to his mother.
If you have forgiven me
then can we please hire a servant?
Why, Adi, when we have you?

-Mandal Commission… -Down with it!
This is All India Radio.
And now, the news by Hari Prasad Mishr.
Today, students called for a nationwide strike against the Mandal Commission.
Its effects were clearly visible in the northern states of India.
In cities like Chandigarh, Delhi, Lucknow, Kanpur, Bhopal,
Benares, Patna, and Allahabad,
students strongly protested against the Mandal Commission.
Large crowds took to the streets,
buses and vehicles were also set ablaze.
Last month, the Prime Minister spoke about the Mandal Commission in Parliament.
-One-two, one-two… -Chuck the commission out of the window!
…demanded 50% reservation,
which is separate from the previously allotted
22.5% reservation to backward classes.
The students are furious due to this reservation.
Mahto…
Yes, sir.
You had to pick this room out of all the rooms?!
There's only one bathroom in the entire station,
and you had to detain them in here!
Couldn't you put them in the other room?
That room is packed with SP sir's furniture.
So…
Where am I supposed to take a dump now? On your head?
Give me a minute, sir.
-Come with me. -Let's go.
This way, sir. I'll handle it.
This way, sir.
-I said that-- -Out of the way!
Go on, sir.
-That way. Make way, come on. -Hey!
Where do you think you're going?
To wipe his senior's ass!
Move!
-One-two, one-two… -Move!
-Chuck the commission out of the window! -Sir--
Take your pants off, Inspector.
Here?
-One-two, one-two… -Chuck the commission out of the window!
Don't let him out.
Daddu, now he'll get out only when we get out.
Chuck the commission out of the window!
-One-two, one-two… -Chuck the commission out of the window!
-One-two, one-two… -Chuck the commission out of the window!
-One-two, one-two… -Hey, move! Out of the way!
-Move! -One-two, one-two…
-Let me go! This is wrong! Don't do this! -One-two, one-two…
-Chuck the commission out of the window! -Sir!
Sir! Hey, stop it!
-Don't push me! Hey! -Chuck the commission out of the window!
Sir!
-Chuck the commission out of the window! -Sir!
Stop. Hop in the back.
Namaste, sir.
Call Sunaina.
Okay, sir.
What are you doing here in a police uniform?
Where's the wedding?
-Benares. She called you so many times-- -Do you know the venue?
Gopal Ganj, Shivmani Chowk, Laxmi Park.
Daddu, listen! What's the point of going there now?
I'll shoot the guy…
who's marrying my Jhulan.
Enough, guys. Let's go.
Why did he stop?
There's a long queue ahead.
Break it then. I wasn't born to wait in lines.
Go, break it.
-Why aren't you dancing? -Hey!
Come on, leave!
Listen, break the line. Come on.
Out of the way!
-Make way! -Hey!
Where?
-What? -Where do you think you're going?
Everyone else waiting in line is not stupid.
Go back!
Go back! Come on!
Maybe they are stupid. How would I know?
-I'm telling you, get back in line. Quick. -Look, you'd better get out of the way.
-If Daddu finds out-- -Then what?
Are you trying to scare me? You--
Look, this isn't right.
Why did you slap him?
This isn't right, Daddu. Let go of my hand.
Now you're talking. Couldn't you talk earlier?
Why did you slap him?
Why did you break the line?
I'll break anything I want.
-This isn't right. -What?
I'll break the line, I'll break bones,
I'll break a neck, I'll even break your bloody arm.
I'm going to tell Loha. He'll set you straight.
Let go of my arm.
Right.
Look, man.
We're having this conversation because you're Loha's brother.
That's why I only nudged you.
Otherwise, I would've shot your ass!
This is not right.
-This is not right, Daddu. -Get lost!
Hey!
Is this some kind of a show?
What are you looking at?
What is it?
-Out of the way, boy! -I won't spare him.
Out of the way!
Man, you've beefed up.
What are you doing here?
What do you mean?
Did you invite someone else?
Why do you care?
What do you mean why do I care?
I'll break your face.
I am your girlfriend.
You were… but not anymore.
How can you forget?
Should I remind you?
Last week, you broke up with me.
It's been a week, and you haven't even tried to patch up!
That's all I've been doing for ten years.
Break off-patch up…
You broke up with me 777 times in ten years.
How many times do I have to keep patching up?
You have no choice but to patch up with me.
You've been keeping count, I see!
Next time, if you don't show up…
I will kill you.
This means…
you're already planning our next breakup.
It always comes between the two of us.
Why?
Don't you remember what date it is today?
Hey!
Even last time, you said that you're on your period.
It's been a month.
No wonder…
you're here to patch up with me.
You're getting pretty clever.
I ran away from home.
What?
How many times do I have to tell you?
This is the boys' hostel, not your home.
Why did you run away?
We can't get married until you become an IAS officer.
And you can forget about passing the IAS exam.
Someday, I'll have to run away.
So, I thought why to waste time!
And I ran away.
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
That day is the day after tomorrow.
Oh, really?
Dad knows about a guy.
He's cleared his IAS final exam.
He's just waiting for the interview.
He's coming to see me the day after tomorrow.
He's just cleared the exam. He's yet to give the interview, right?
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
Because of your careless attitude, I'll end up getting married someday.
Here's the thing, Daddu…
the day I clear the IAS exam, we'll elope.
Feel free to elope with me then.
For now…
let's go have your favorite ice cream.
Don't carry it in the front like that.
If someday, it goes off,
you'll be of no use to me.
In fact, you'll be of no use to anyone.
And if it goes off there, it will blow up your entire ass.
It'll be pretty painful in the morning.
Then you suggest me a place.
Give it back to whoever gave it to you.
It's for your own good.
-This Loha Singh-- -Come on, it's getting late.
Before you start again, let's go.
Loha has promised to get me the UPSC exam paper,
so that we can get married. And you have a problem with him.
He's only using you, Daddu.
Here you go.
Okay, bye.
Hey, give me a mouth freshener.
-When is the guy coming over to see you? -The day after tomorrow.
Oh…
-See you. -Be careful.
I'll kill you!
-Leave! -Going.
Excuse me, mister.
Which way is 734 SP Yadav's house?
-SP Yadav? The bank manager? -Yes.
Take the next right, okay?
You'll have to walk on foot.
-It's a narrow street. -Okay.
-Mr. Yadav? -Yes. Please, come in.
Have a seat, Uncle.
Have a seat.
Congratulations!
Congratulations?
You cleared the IAS final exam!
That's amazing.
Where is Mr. Yadav, son?
You'll meet him pretty soon, Uncle.
But first, let me interview your son.
Interview?
Being an IAS officer is not an easy job.
Soon, the entire district will be your responsibility.
Are you ready for it?
Give me your hand.
What?
-Come on, do it. -Hey--
-Son, what are you-- -Hey!
What is this?
This is your interview.
You have to guess which one is real and which one is fake.
I'll count to ten.
Real? Fake?
Don't be afraid.
Your touch won't trigger the gun.
One's touch merely spreads love!
One, two, three, four…
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
They are both real. You failed.
So, put your finger on the lips and sit.
And Uncle, Auntie, don't worry.
You only have to do what you're told.
Look, son, you--
I think there's been a big misunderstanding.
What do you want?
Don't be scared. We don't want anything.
We just want you to welcome the guests with mouth fresheners.
Let's go, Batru.
Should I turn on the fan if it's too hot?
No, it's okay. I sweat too much.
Call your daughter.
Yes, call your daughter.
Yes. Jhulan.
Let's go.
-Oh, no. -Careful.
-Let it be, son. -It's okay.
We'll get it cleared.
Give it to them, dear.
What would you like to have? Gold Spot or Limca?
A kiss.
-What? -What?
-What did you say, brother? -No, I don't want anything.
-I'd told you I can't do it. Move. -Hey!
-Wait a second-- -Make way!
Listen, brother!
I am so sorry, Uncle.
Actually, my brother isn't ready to get married.
We convinced him a lot to get him here.
I apologize. Forgive me.
Sorry.
Loha has called everyone. Let's go.
Hey!
Let's go.
Jayesh! What are you guys talking about? Let's go!
Don't you get it?
Let's go! Daddu's calling! Come on!
Where are you going all dressed up?
You got a hostel.
What about the other students?
-Bring him along. -Where to, brother?
VC's chamber.
Loha Singh is going to talk to him.
Come on, guys! Let's go!
Let's go!
Gunjan's refusing to join us.
Normally, you make such tall claims.
Now when you have a chance to help the students,
you're refusing to even come along.
First of all, Daddu, I'm studying.
Secondly, how can you forget?
We shared the same room for two years.
Didn't we?
Why can't we do it now?
Tell me.
This "one student, one room" slogan,
was floated by your beloved Loha.
So he could earn a fortune in the new hostel contract.
Are you coming along or not?
What are you doing?
I'm not going, and nor are you.
This is not funny. Come on. Open the door.
Your father's no more. Your mom lives at your uncle's place.
She sent you here, so that you can make something of yourself.
But all Daddu cares about is raising a riot in college.
You're not going.
What are you doing? Give me the keys.
-Everyone's waiting for me. -Let them wait.
I'm not going to open the door.
Standing there won't help. I am not giving you the key.
I haven't forgotten it, bro,
but seems like you have…
that even I stayed in this room for two years.
Hey! Hey, Daddu!
-Every student's dream… -One student, one room!
-Every student's dream… -One student, one room!
-Every student's dream… -One student, one room!
-Every student's dream… -One student, one room!
-It's business, not education… -It's all love for the notes.
-It's business, not education… -It's all love for the notes.
-It's business, not education… -It's all love for the notes.
-It's business, not education… -It's all love for the notes.
-VC, don't mess with us, dare you! -We students won't spare you!
-Make way for Loha. -Hey, move!
Make way for him.
What is all this?
Look…
I will not tolerate all this.
All this nonsense.
What goes your father?
What?
Hey…
he means to say, what is your problem?
What?
I will call the police.
Listen…
I'll switch to Hindi…
because my English is a little weak.
Students will get a new hostel at any cost.
Now, who's supposed to sign the permission letter…
you can figure that out.
You figure.
The new hostel will take at least two years to build.
And I don't have any space for the new students.
In that case…
the new students can share rooms with us.
Change the rule.
I mean, allot one room to two students…
and a dormitory to four.
Wonderful idea!
And I guarantee you, the new hostel will be complete in a year.
Great.
Just sign the permission letter.
Live long.
-Long live… -Loha Bhaiya!
-Long live… -Loha Bhaiya!
Will you two stop fighting?
You both are my brothers, yet you're fighting among yourselves.
What are the people going to say? What will the boys think?
-Come on, shake hands. -Daddu hit me.
Hey… shake hands.
Gopal,
you took it to heart.
-I was just having some fun-- -See…
Hey!
You'll never change.
Come on, brother.
I'll be getting hold of the medical entrance exam papers.
Start collecting money from the students.
This time, I've tied up with a coaching class.
-Really? -Believe me.
We're going to make a fortune.
Great.
Do you think I can't sell the medical exam papers?
Give me a cigarette.
I can make a bigger fortune.
Question papers are never leaked to earn money.
They're leaked to earn respect.
Even a goddamn peon can make money.
But respect is important.
I can earn that too.
You can't even light a cigarette.
Jhulan.
Yes?
Don't take the IAS exam this year.
Take it next year.
Why waste an attempt!
Waste an attempt?
What do you mean?
There's a new commission coming.
We'll all fall under reservation.
Even if you score low marks,
you'll definitely clear IAS.
So why waste an attempt?
Don't you trust me, Dad?
I've prepared really well.
I don't need any reservations.
I can clear IAS. I am sure.
Don't argue over everything.
Your father must have a reason to say what he said.
I am not arguing.
I've studied in the best school, I'm going to a coaching class.
Reservation is for those who don't get these opportunities.
I have everything.
Why do I need any reservations?
I'll try this year.
Let me drop you off.
No, I'll manage.
-It's in the opposite direction for you. -No, it's not.
I've been transferred to the university branch.
Let's go.
OUTSIDERS NOT ALLOWED
Hello, Dhiraj.
-Mr. Yadav. -Are you also in this branch?
Yes.
What were you racing for?
What if Dad had found out?
Mr. Yadav is your father, not a superman…
to see through this helmet.
Why was he dropping you off today?
-He's going to do it every day. -What?
He's been transferred to the university branch.
-Oh. -Anyway, tell me.
You forgot, didn't you?
Forgot what?
Today is our tenth anniversary.
Anniversary?
What anniversary?
Don't you remember how many times you've broken up with me?
First, in January.
Before that, in May. Then in March, then in January again.
This way, we'll be celebrating our anniversary dozens of times a year.
Stop the bike.
-What? -I want to get off. Stop the bike.
Are you breaking up with me again?
Yes. Stop the bike now.
We'll have to celebrate another anniversary then.
Stop the bike!
Neither awake nor asleep
Don't know what world I'm lost in
Can't figure out anything
Every breath I take in your absence
Is hard to imagine
I'm drawn toward you
Can't control myself
Is this love?
Yes, this is love
Is this love?
Yes, this is love
A day without you is hard to imagine
Time stands still
Is this love?
Yes, this is love
I nod my head
To everything you say
I nod my head
To everything you say
Wherever you go
I go too
I go too
Can't control my heart
Every time I look at you
Is this love?
Yes, this is love
Is this love?
Yes, this is love
-Daddu! -Yes, brother!
Where have you been?
You've been missing for 10-15 days.
I was preparing for the IAS exam.
Like I said…
you'll get the paper.
Let's go.
I had a word with Tripathi.
You'll be taking the exam in the DM's office.
Okay.
Don't worry.
That's all fine, brother.
But I must clear IAS this year.
I know you'll get me the paper, but…
I should know which answer is in what book, right?
You're completely floored in love.
Brother…
Okay, fine. Study hard.
But be there on time. The medical papers are arriving.
I am getting late.
Don't worry, I'll make you an IAS officer.
I have no doubt about that, brother.
Getting late?
Getting late for what?
Now I understand… why you have such a careless attitude.
That's all you heard!
Didn't you hear that Loha's getting me the UPSC paper?
I also heard that you're being called to distribute the medical papers.
Sorry, love.
I'll have to go for a while.
Let's have a quickie.
Quickie…
Don't worry.
You'll be on time.
-Really? -Nobody studies here
The entire world's a gambling house
Every criminal here is fearless
-Try your luck here -Bravo!
Everything's available without hard work
The entire world's a gambling house
-Get going. -Every criminal here is fearless
Try your luck here
Everything's available without hard work
Nobody studies here
Nobody studies here
Nobody studies here
Nobody studies here
Nobody studies here
JANSHAKTI PARTY
HEAD OFFICE
What is this?
It's sir's picture.
Where's the mustache? Add the mustache.
Loha's here.
Couldn't you tell me Loha's here?
Do you know who he is?
-Yes. -He's the student leader.
-Namaste, sir. -Student leader now,
full-time leader tomorrow. He'll show you what metal he's made of.
Come.
-Sorry, sir. -Next time, don't make him wait.
Sir.
Here's the money for the medical papers.
We've nearly made a fortune.
Awesome.
Is the chicken still raw?
No.
Where did you get it?
Chopstick Corner, sir.
Don't eat it.
He got a beating a few days ago.
He put dog meat in the food instead of chicken.
They both taste the same.
Bloody Dubey!
You made me eat dog meat!
Rascal!
Mr. Tripathi, this has 700,000 rupees.
Never settle for less.
Always think big.
Do you understand big?
Yes.
Balls!
I have plans for your career as well.
Have you heard about the commission?
Yes.
The Center's going to pass the reservation commission.
It will create a row all over the country.
Students will be out on the streets,
protesting against the government.
This is a huge chance for you.
Do you understand, Loha?
This is your opportunity to be the biggest student leader in Allahabad.
Even my party will oppose the commission when the time is right.
But if you stir things up…
I guarantee you, no one will lay a finger on you.
No one can lay a finger on me anyway.
I've earned a reputation.
As for the job…
I will heat things up in Allahabad.
Brother… are you angry?
I am not angry.
I am sorry.
Sorry?
Sorry for what?
I cannot make you an IAS officer.
What?
Couldn't you get hold of the paper?
Paper isn't the problem.
Read this.
GOVERNMENT TO FORM MANDAL COMMISSION
What is this, brother?
Mandal Commission.
The central government will pass this bill.
And once this bill is passed…
students' life will become hell.
Because the government
will give reservation to backward caste students everywhere.
Once the commission is in force…
even if you score 90%,
a backward caste student with a 45% score
will get your seat.
Its timing is all wrong.
Had it been implemented a year later,
I would've made you an IAS officer.
Forget all about IAS and Jhulan.
And inform Jhulan's family--
How can I forget all that?
And how can anyone just take my place?
My life's not some sweet dish that anyone can devour.
This is not done, brother.
There must be an option.
Pappu, give me water.
-Yes, brother. -Hurry up.
Pratik, how's your preparation for engineering going?
All good, Daddu.
This time, I'll clear IIT.
You'll clear IIT,
but the reservation will clear you out.
Instead, start a garage. At least, you'll make a few bucks.
What about you, Anurag?
I was preparing for IFS.
But now, I'm confused about what to do.
Start a travel agency instead.
Do you know what 27% reservation means?
Twenty-seven percent?!
They already have 22.5% reservations.
Fifty percent.
So, we lose out on half the seats.
Reservation is going to screw us all, believe me.
What can we do?
There's nothing you can do.
Why don't you accompany him on his first night too?
He'll need your help to unzip.
Stop laughing.
It's not funny.
I don't want to go for this anti-commission agitation.
Here's a question.
Don't you have a girlfriend?
I do. Why?
So, tell me one thing.
You impressed her on your own, right?
You must have worked hard.
This is the same.
We'll have to make efforts to cajole our future.
Got it?
Where are you going?
I am not interested in having a girlfriend or calling a strike.
I came here to study, so I'll just do that.
-Daddu… -Yes, brother.
We're picketing outside the CM's house the day after tomorrow.
He's leaving for Delhi. We won't let him out of the house.
This is a huge opportunity.
To send a message to Delhi.
We'll need a large number of students.
How are we going to do it?
Don't worry, brother.
Why did you walk off in front of everyone?
Do you know anything about the Mandal Commission?
Or are you following Loha Singh blindly?
-Do you know? -What?
Do you know?
Do I know?
Caste-based reservations will affect me the most.
I've been preparing for UPSC for three years.
I've been saving money to pay for coaching classes.
And you're asking me if I know?!
Great.
So you should be thanking me.
Thank you for what?
Because I'm fighting your battle.
Do you think this is fun?
This is not about you, me, or Loha.
It's about all the students.
Otherwise, you'll have to sell these books for free.
Stop looking for excuses not to fight.
You're doing the right thing, Daddu.
We'll get 100-150 people from our college.
-How many? -Around 100-150.
Are you joking?
Two hundred girls are coming from the girls' college.
-Leave it, it's not your cup of tea. -Are you serious, Daddu?
Girls are coming too?!
I'll bring 300.
Let's go.
I can get 50 girls guaranteed.
Okay.
I'll try my best to get more.
Please try, Neetu,
because we have to form a human chain outside the CM's house.
I'll try my best.
-Please try. -Yes, sure.
-Okay, thank you. -Bye.
Where were you?
I looked all over for you.
Computer classes, hostel. I was even planning to go to your house today.
And you're hanging out with these people?!
Even that day, you disappeared.
Do you remember your UPSC exam, or did that slip your mind as well?
Leave it.
Now it's of no use even if I take the exam.
I don't have any option until I make them cancel this commission.
When were you going to tell me that you're getting involved in all this?
And have you lost your mind?
Few protests and riots won't cancel this commission.
This is not our battle, Daddu.
Coming!
Sorry, I couldn't tell you about it the other day.
I guess it slipped my mind.
But I have to go now.
Daddu, I--
I'll pick you up from your home, okay? Bye.
-Daddu, I'm telling you. Daddu-- -Bye.
-Daddu! -I'll see you in two days.
-Commission… -Go back!
-Commission… -Down with it!
-Commission… -Go back!
Sir, we'll have to push them back. The CM is about to leave.
Down with it!
-Push everyone back! -Okay, sir.
Just push them back!
-Those who mess with us… -Will get beaten black and blue!
-Commission… -Down with it!
-Commission… -Down with it!
-Those who mess with us… -Will get beaten black and blue!
-Those who mess with us… -Will get beaten black and blue!
-Those who mess with us… -Will get beaten black and blue!
-Those who mess with us… -Will get beaten black and blue!
-Those who mess with us… -Will get beaten black and blue!
Beat them up!
Will get beaten black and blue!
-Those who mess with us… -Will get beaten black and blue!
Hey… no one will move from here!
-Commission… -Down with it!
-Go back! -Go back!
-Go back! -Go back!
-Go back! -Go back!
This is All India Radio.
The news by Omprakash Sharma.
A riot broke out between the protesting students and the police
outside the CM's residence in Allahabad.
The students picketed outside the CM residence…
and didn't allow the CM to leave.
Students are protesting against the Mandal Commission…
If you play with fire
We'll burn everything down
Justice will never spare you
You're unaware that we're fire
Don't teach us how to burn bright
We give what we get
We give what we get
You'll get twofold back
We give what we get
You'll get twofold back
How are you?
Hey.
What's with all the secrets?
Oh!
-You look great! -I feel great!
Eat some food as well.
Mr. Tripathi…
he is Daddu.
Nice.
Very good.
If you keep protesting like that,
the commission will definitely go back.
Daddu's the guy you spoke to DM about.
For the UPSC.
IAS?
Yes.
Go, have fun.
The guy's like a bullet.
Bullet.
You're a good leader,
but why are you not in the limelight?
Why are you making him the hero?
I've passed the age of becoming the hero.
So, I gave this chance to young blood.
I am working behind the scene.
Meaning?
I'll call the shots,
and he'll do the bidding.
I see.
You'll break a shoulder.
Open it.
Have a drink.
Sir, I'm on duty.
He's an IAS officer.
Think about it once.
Do you want to be a bottle opener for the rest of your life?
Jhulan.
Jhulan!
Oh, God!
Jhulan.
I've brought ice cream for you.
Come and eat it.
Hurry up, or else, the ice cream will melt.
You should've been there yesterday.
The agitation was awesome. It was unreal.
What happened?
My exams are over.
Every day, I receive a new marriage proposal.
I'm worried sick,
and you're worried about the commission.
This is caste politics, Daddu.
Everyone's in it for personal gains.
Why don't you focus on your IAS exam instead?
Look…
this commission will never let me become an IAS officer.
So I'll become an MLA instead.
Even your father won't have a problem with this.
MLA?
Can you be an MLA in a couple of months?
Are you joking?
How can anyone become an MLA in a couple of months?
Exactly.
Let's elope and get married first, then you do anything you want.
Why are you always hellbent on running away and getting married?
How will we get married? Where will we live?
We aren't settled either.
Meaning?
I mean--
Meaning what?
-Don't you even want to get married? -I do. Of course, I do.
I am doing all this because I want to get married.
But things will take time, Jhulan.
Time is what we don't have, Daddu.
I'll have to get married as soon as the guy says yes.
Don't you get it?
Okay.
You want to be a leader, right? Fine.
Forget everything.
Focus on being a leader.
-Okay? I am going. -What are you saying, Jhulan? Hey!
Jhulan, where are you going?
Hey! Hey, Jhulan! Hey, wait!
Why don't you understand?
I'm doing this for both of us.
Where am I in this "us"?
You are making all the decisions.
First, you wanted to become an IAS officer! Now, you want to become an MLA!
Tomorrow, you'll want to be a movie star.
Come on!
You be what you want to be, Daddu.
I'm getting late. I'm going home. Okay?
Don't walk away like this.
-Come inside. -Let go of my hand!
Please come inside.
Are you breaking up with me again?
Whatever suits you.
You decide.
If you think we're breaking up,
then so be it.
Jhulan…
Hello.
Hello?
Hello!
He's called several times. Why aren't you speaking to him?
Why should I?
Enough with your drama! I know!
This attitude of yours won't last too long.
Soon, you'll be back with him again.
You two can't live without each other.
This time, I'm not going back.
Once he gets over becoming a leader, he'll come crawling back!
Get up.
Just do what I called you here for.
Come here.
Give me a hickey here on the nape.
What's a hickey?
You don't know what a hickey is?!
Quit fasting, and start living.
Let me show you what a hickey is.
Oh, God! That hurts! Let go of my hand!
That hurt?!
It's going to hurt a lot more.
Come on, give me a hickey.
Wait. Let me close the door first, or people will think we're lesbians.
Try these fritters. They're pretty popular.
Well, if you two want to talk, you can go to the terrace.
What is your favorite hobby?
Hobby?
Computers.
I like everything about computers.
Its size, shape, body, and buttons.
And you?
The entire city's shaken up, Mr. Tripathi.
Shaking up one city alone won't help.
We'll have to jostle Delhi as well.
Keep trying until you two feature…
on the evening news.
Make it so hot that Delhi feels the heat.
When will you openly support us, Mr. Tripathi?
Daddu is smart.
My party cannot stop supporting the Center yet.
First, build a firm ground,
and then watch the fun.
The government's supporting Mandal.
Soon, we'll make them tremble!
Let's go.
Tell me something, brother.
Why didn't Tripathi's party oppose the bill in Parliament?
Daddu, this is only politics for him… not for us.
And he will never openly oppose the commission.
Otherwise, he'll lose his entire vote bank.
If he says one word against the backward,
his vote bank will be gone.
The commission doesn't make a difference to him.
But students' lives will be completely ruined.
Start opposing the backward.
Reservation!
Only those people who don't want to see our progress are against reservation.
Reservation…
-What is it? -is our right!
Hey, what are you doing?
-What is this? -Look, they are not anti-backward.
You don't need to feel so insecure.
Read them carefully and then talk.
Get them out of here. Get out.
-Hey! -Tear the pamphlets.
-In fact, I even got married in Benares. -Oh, okay.
My first posting was in Benares.
Sunaina, go get Jhulan quickly.
Where were you?
The groom and his family have been waiting for so long.
Come and give me a hickey quickly.
Currently, I stay in Benares.
I will stay there for a couple of years.
Great.
-Have something, son. -Yes, please.
-I-- -Try some samosas. Jhulan has made them.
She's a really good cook.
Try it, son.
In fact, if you two want to talk,
then go to the veranda.
You can talk at leisure there.
Tea?
Your father said you're preparing for IAS as well.
Yes… I am.
What was your major?
Math.
Math…
Is that a bite mark on your neck?
What?
Does it itch?
Even my sister-in-law often has a bite mark on her neck.
She says it's itchy.
So, I got her some antiseptic.
Now it's all better.
You should try it too.
It will heal quickly.
Yes!
Sure.
Yes, of course. Goodbye.
Pravin has agreed to marry Jhulan.
Let's celebrate.
Goddess has heard my prayers.
Glory to Goddess!
Tell me, what should I do?
Where are you going?
I have extra classes.
Sushant's dropping me off.
I'll drop you off.
I am also heading that way.
Give me the keys.
What?
Daddu.
Hello.
Bablu Yadav?
Yes, talk to him.
Yes, hello?
Speaking.
MLA Sushil?
Yes, of course. I will come over.
Watch how MLA Sushil welcomes me!
-Why did you stop here? -Get out! Come on!
-Who are you? What are you doing? -Come out!
Hey--
-Daddu, I'm warning you. Let go of me. -Hey!
What are you doing? Did I tell you to shoot him?
Loha told me.
-We won't spare you-- -Loha didn't tell me anything.
Get lost.
Get lost.
-I am telling you, this isn't right. -Shut up!
Keep walking.
He deserves this.
He's the one who slapped you the other day, right?
Yes.
Slap him back.
Why?
Forward or backward…
if you slap a girl, then be prepared to be slapped back.
Oh, no!
She's already slapped me once, and now she's getting in line again.
-Give him a big one! -That was awesome.
Brother… did you ask for me?
Bravo, Daddu!
He got him slapped by females.
I have a foreign treat for you.
Foreign treat?
A girl is waiting upstairs.
She'll take you on a tour of Russia right here in Allahabad.
I have to go.
What? Jhulan?
Did you two break up again?
Well, it's common between us.
Love, Coca-Cola…
I have zero experience in this field.
Girls only love me…
they don't look at me.
Well…
you should leave then.
There's no stopping you.
Okay, brother. See you later.
Couldn't you think of a better way to embarrass me?
You decided to elope with that gangster!
You have no respect for your father's reputation.
I'm still going to elope with him.
-Keep an eye on me. -Jhulan! You have no shame at all!
How dare you argue with your father!
We're going to stay in Benares until the wedding.
Which one is Daddu Thakur's room?
Find it yourself. I am busy.
-Handle them. -Okay, sir.
Do you have a matchstick?
Daddu, wake up.
It's a raid. The police are coming to arrest you.
-Run. -Get lost.
They can arrest you under any charge.
You'd better run.
Where is Daddu Thakur?
Don't know him!
What? You don't know him?
Do you think it's funny? Get lost!
Hey, what's your name?
-I was-- -You're Daddu, aren't you?
Son, I'm as old as your uncle.
Get in!
We've searched the whole hostel! I wonder where he is hiding!
-Let's look-- -Sir!
Yes?
-Sir, Daddu just ran downstairs. -This way?
-Yes. -Come on, let's go!
-Where are you going, Daddu? -I'll thank you later.
-But where will you go? -Daddu, stop!
-Daddu! -Come on, jump!
It's too high! Oh my God!
What if I fall?
I won't jump.
-Daddu! -Daddu!
Daddu--
-Sir… -Daddu!
-What are you doing? -Daddu!
Stop, Daddu! Stop, I said!
-He's making us go round in circles. -Catch him.
-Daddu, no. -I will kill you.
-Hey! -Catch him!
Hey, stop!
Catch him!
Stop!
-Daddu! -Daddu!
Daddu!
-Stop! -Stop!
Daddu.
Daddu!
-Hey, Daddu! -Daddu!
Catch him!
-Don't come closer, I'll kill you! -Catch him!
Daddu, no! Daddu, stop!
-No, Daddu! -Scoundrel!
I am warning you, Daddu!
-Daddu! -You…
Uncle, want some?
-I'll hit you, I swear! -Give me that stick, Daddu!
Who let you in?
-Sorry, sir. -Who gave you permission?
Sorry.
I…
I got orders from above to arrest him.
-He's not some goon you can arrest. -But--
-What? -I had orders--
-He's my brother. -Sorry, sir. Okay.
-Before I beat you up, get lost. -Yes--
-Let's go! -Get lost!
-Let's go! -Sorry, sir!
Sorry.
What have you done to the place!
Can I get a cigarette, brother?
I was fast asleep when these guys came for me.
Here.
They were planning this for a long time.
When you were picketing outside the CM's residence,
they didn't arrest you for my sake.
Now they must have felt the pressure from above.
Move in with me.
You can't stay in the hostel anymore.
The government has implemented Section 144.
What is Section 144?
Curfew.
The students are planning a strike against the commission on the 20th of September.
So, the government has implemented Section 144.
If they see more than four people together on the streets, they'll arrest them.
No agitation either.
I wonder how we'll do it.
Jhulan.
Listen, child.
The priest has said…
that there are no dates available for three months after 20th September.
So, your father and I have fixed your wedding for the 20th.
But--
Dad!
My exams are on the 16th…
and you've fixed my wedding for the 20th?!
Complete your studies after the wedding.
Thank your uncle.
We found a place in Benares because of his contacts.
Otherwise, you had left no stone unturned.
No one can stop me from taking the exam.
Sit over there.
Thank you for yesterday.
How come the police aren't looking for you anymore?
Now, even they are on our side.
In fact, everyone's on my side except for you.
What are you saying?
I am saying…
that if we're both against the reservation,
then why are you hesitating to join hands with me?
Speak softly.
I'm not against the reservation.
Hey. The other day, you were making such tall claims.
"Reservation will affect me the most.
I've been preparing for three years," etc.
You never listen, do you?
Reservation based on the caste system is wrong.
Reservation should be based on economic conditions.
Secondly, the reservation doesn't guarantee opportunities.
But education definitely guarantees great opportunities.
You mean you are against it, aren't you?
Even I am against it, then why do you--
Silence!
I'm trying to teach here.
Take your conversation outside if you like.
They think it's a joke!
Let me just…
Sorry, sir.
Sir…
he's got some sort of an emergency.
So, we'll just go out.
Sorry for disturbing you.
Sorry!
Wait, buddy. Why are you so furious?
This is what I am against.
Someone says a word, and you point a gun at him.
If you continue your agitation without violence…
then I can join you.
But I won't criticize the other caste.
Done.
What else?
Will Loha Singh agree to these terms?
Don't worry about that.
I will convince him.
Shall we go?
Even Jhulan throws fewer tantrums than you.
Will you be my girlfriend?
Why? Haven't you patched up with Jhulan yet?
I would even patch up with her father,
but she isn't picking up the phone.
Why do you get so furious over everything?
Pravin asked me about the exams, so I told him.
Pravin said I must take the exam.
He's my future husband.
I'll do as he says.
He's your future husband.
Don't address him by his name.
It's rude.
He's my future husband. He isn't my husband yet.
When he becomes my husband, I won't call him Pravin anymore.
Alright? Can I go now?
It's rude, she says!
Abhinav.
Did Jhulan come here?
No, brother. She didn't.
Fine. Tell me if she does.
Okay, brother. I will.
Alright.
-No, please! Don't hit me! -Loha, don't! It will hurt!
Loha!
-Brother, don't! -Hey--
-Did it hurt? -No.
No.
Your timing is completely off, Mahto.
Sir… we have a great opportunity today.
Daddu Thakur is giving a speech in the college.
Should I arrest him?
I'd given you a chance that day in the hostel,
but you missed it.
If you lay a finger on him now,
the students will beat you first…
and then I will.
Got it?
Sir, you're unbelievable.
That day, you planned a raid on the hostel to get him arrested.
Now, you're saying, "Don't lay a finger on him."
I just don't get it.
Gopal!
Yeah?
I've found your twin brother.
Say hello.
Hello, brother.
Have you ever flown a kite?
-Of course, I have, brother. Why? -I see.
-When the kite's soaring in the skies, -Yeah?
-it has a different kind of attitude. -Right.
It flies as if it's on its own.
But you've got to yank the thread and remind the kite
that someone else is in control.
If they let go, it will have nowhere to go.
Now, do you understand?
Yes, sir. I do.
Great, sir.
-You're awesome. I'll get going now. -See you.
Yeah.
Thank you, sir.
Loha!
Jhulan's brother, Sushant, had called asking for Daddu.
Jhulan's parents have fixed her wedding.
-I'll go tell Daddu right now. -Who called?
Sushant.
-Who? -Jhulan's brother Sushant.
Who?
Brother!
Come on, go.
Brother…
why didn't you get Daddu arrested?
Even I can shut down colleges.
I guess it'll take me an entire lifetime to explain to you.
Let's go and see what's happening in the college.
Opportunity.
Everyone should get it equally.
Backward and forward are filled with people who have neither money nor jobs.
A Brahman's son can be poor…
as well as a Yadav's son.
Opportunities should be given to the poor.
So, the problem is not the reservation.
The problem is the caste-based reservation.
The commission's approach is totally wrong.
Girls in Maharashtra have been getting free education since 1985.
So, if students all over India get free education…
then we'll never need any reservations.
And if you still want to give the reservation,
then give it to the poor. We're not stopping you.
Now, this is every student's battle.
Those who are here, and also, those who aren't.
Backward and forward, both.
All colleges will remain closed on 20th September.
Allahabad comes into our territory.
So, let's spread the word to every student and light this commission on fire.
Section 144 is implemented outside…
not inside the college.
You couldn't think of this?
Daddu found a solution.
If you screw with the students…
then you'll get a beating of your life.
He's convinced Ranjan as well.
All the smart guys joined in because of him.
Could you have convinced anyone?
If he finds out that Jhulan's getting married,
then he'll forget all about the commission.
-Commission… -Down with it!
Do you see it now? Even after your constant coaxing,
Daddu isn't saying a word against the backward class.
Now he's even joining hands with them.
What does that matter?
What matters is how many people are turning up!
I don't care if the commission is a hit or not.
Allahabad should be under lockdown,
so that I can become popular in the party.
-Mandal Commission… -Down with it!
-Mandal Commission… -Down with it!
-Government dictatorship… -Down with it!
Listen, tell everyone to join us.
If a student is financially weak,
does it mean he's an orphan?
-Is this right? -No!
-Is this right? -No!
Only education can bring forward and backward together.
Everyone has an equal right to it.
That's why education is important for both classes.
We'll study on the streets.
The entire class will be on the streets on 20th September.
If that's where we're going to be…
-Mandal Commission… -Down with it!
-Abolish reservation… -Save the nation.
ONCE STUDENTS ARE AWOKEN THE COUNTRY'S EYES WILL OPEN
-Hurry up! -Hurry up! Come on!
What happened, brother?
-Get them all! -Brother!
Get them.
Move the tempo, dude! What are you waiting for?
COMMISSION DOWN WITH IT
20TH SEPTEMBER ALLAHABAD CLOSED
Let's go!
-Let's go! -Come on, man, move!
"Students' protests show effect, Prime Minister will meet 50 students."
You'll represent Allahabad in this delegation.
What will I do?
You're currently the star of Allahabad.
You're going.
Sir, I am just a government employee.
What can I tell you about government policies?
Goodbye.
If you wanted to shatter my dreams
If you wanted to leave me
Then why did you pretend to love me?
If you wanted to shatter my dreams
If you wanted to leave me
Then why did you pretend to love me?
I'm upset with you
I feel aloof from myself
I'm completely broken
I'm upset with you
I feel aloof from myself
I'm completely broken
ONCE STUDENTS ARE AWOKEN THE COUNTRY'S EYES WILL OPEN
One that separates you from me
That world is a lie
They don't understand lovers
I'd rather set them ablaze
We must show them.
We'll all speak in one voice.
Right, Daddu?
…praises just as it taunts
This world is full of sorrow
It only gives you pain
I'm upset with you
I feel aloof from myself
I'm completely broken
I'm upset with you
I feel aloof from myself
I'm completely broken
Your message should be strong.
Daddu will tell you what time and where.
What happened?
I just don't know where to look for Jhulan.
What if she's visiting some relative? Did you check?
Her relatives are all over.
Patna, Delhi, etc.
Where will I look?
Am I angry with myself
Or am I upset with the world?
I want to ask myself when I find God
What were you thinking?
Tell me, why did you create love?
Make this pain everyone's destiny
Why are you coming out the back door?
I… climbed down, and I…
-Anyway-- -I got confused.
You're right, all the galleries look alike.
Yes.
-But you… -I'd gone to get some ice cream.
-Your mother mentioned that you love it. -If you wanted to shatter my dreams
This is for you.
If you wanted to leave me
Then why did you pretend to love me?
Your eyes can't hide
-What happened? Was the paper tough? -Your love
Why did you make me
-If you wanted to break me? -Let me see.
It's alright. You can try again next year.
I'll coach you. Please don't--
Don't… worry.
Everything…
You--
Come on, show me your aim.
Bravo. Angry young man.
What's the matter?
There's no trace of Jhulan.
We've broken up several times,
but for the first time, I have a feeling that something is totally off.
My mind is exploding like a volcano.
Haven't you two patched up yet?
I'll help you two patch up.
Patch up with whom, brother?
She's disappeared with her entire family.
I want to quit this agitation and find her--
And find Jhulan first, right?
You're absolutely right.
After all, you're doing all this for her.
Without her, the agitation can go to hell.
These students are not our responsibility.
I started all this for you, bro. Remember?
So, we'll look for Jhulan. Everything else comes later.
Come on, let's find out.
That's the problem, brother.
These students are supporting me on my call.
For the first time, I feel like I'm doing something awesome in life.
Everyone's future depends on it. I cannot just quit.
That's amazing, bro.
Amazing.
You'll get twofold back
You'll get twofold back
-Mandal Commission… -Down with it!
This started the French Revolution,
which led to the birth of the first French republic.
Daddu, the girls' college is still open.
-And there are police outside their gate. -I have an idea. Let's go.
COMMISSION DOWN WITH IT
You'll get twofold back
You'll get twofold back
One who rules without a plan
Is like a double-edged sword
Seems like a ruckus to them
What we call our right
What we call our right
You're trying to save Your seat in this game
We're trying to save Our present and future
You follow your own path
While we make one
We rise of our own will
And fall of our own will
We give what we get
You'll get twofold back
Come on!
POLICE
Get in!
Every student should fight, education should be our fundamental right!
Daddu!
Daddu!
Daddu! Somebody call him!
Daddu!
-What? -Jhulan is getting married.
-What? What are you saying? -Wedding!
-What? -Jhulan is getting married.
Daddu!
Listen…
the wedding…
The wedding is over, sir.
Do you know where they went?
Yes, sir.
Everyone's staying at the guesthouse.
For strength.
Jhulan.
Jhulan!
Hey!
Jhulan…
I am married now.
Do you know what that means?
Yes.
-I'm here for you now. -Oh, really?
You should've waited until I had a few kids!
How would I know that you're getting married?
I tried to contact you--
You would have known if you had time.
You wanted to fight for the students!
You wanted to send the commission back!
You wanted to become an MLA, reach new heights!
Is it all done?
Are you an MLA now?
Where were you?
Why are you crying now?
Where were you? Why--
-I… -Okay, I am here now.
I am here. Calm down.
I was telling you we should elope, but you never listened.
Now we had to elope anyway.
That too, after my marriage.
-Please, Jhulan. -Of all the places…
Couldn't you find a better place?
-There is no other place. -Please, Daddu, I don't want to stay here.
Try to understand--
-I don't want to stay here! -I can't take you to my uncle's place.
-Why don't you understand? -Daddu.
Brother.
Did you get married?
-No, brother-- -I got married.
He got left out.
He would have been married too…
had he not been busy building your political career.
-Jhulan… -It's alright.
She's like a daughter-in-law to me. It's my fault, I made you too busy.
-Shall we? -Are you two going somewhere?
The police are after us.
First, they were after him. Now, they are after me too.
That's what I was trying to tell you. The police never come to Loha's place.
Yes, they don't.
My husband is the Collector, and he's not even a politician.
He's just a small-time leader.
-No offense. -None taken.
When the Collector comes for us, we'll have to leave Allahabad.
And if we get arrested, we'll be taken to the court.
And there's nothing he can do.
Calm down.
No, she is absolutely right.
He's the Collector.
Better to be safe, not sorry.
You cannot stay here anymore.
We'll have to send her to a safe place.
Agra. Agra is good. Let's send her to Agra.
Munilal is there. He'll arrange everything.
I'll arrange everything.
-Okay, brother. -I'll arrange everything.
I won't stay here.
Look…
we'll look for her together.
Well… Pravin is the Collector.
If he alerts the police,
they can set up checkpoints and look for them.
Haven't we been embarrassed enough?
What are we going to say?
"The Collector's wife eloped"?
How are we going to find her?
I don't want to find her.
I won't register this marriage.
It's your fault, Mr. Yadav.
She's a female, not some cattle you can herd.
This wedding shouldn't have happened.
-Come on! -Throw the ball, Chintu!
Daddu, don't tell anyone about the wedding or about going to Agra yet.
If students find out you're quitting the agitation,
who knows how they will react!
We share a different rapport,
but the students will feel cheated.
Get over with tomorrow's agitation.
After that, I'll send you to Agra.
Jhulan was right.
He's the Collector. He'll do something.
His wife ran away from the wedding.
This is the matter, sir.
What happened? Any problem?
No.
We have to send Daddu to Delhi tomorrow for the PM's delegation.
Daddu cannot go to Delhi, sir. He's marrying a backward himself.
-Hey! -I'm telling you, sir.
We're making him the hero,
-and he's screwing with us. -Hey, you…
-How dare you say that! -Don't slap him, Loha.
What are you doing? Let go of him.
-If you weren't my brother-- -Don't do this.
It doesn't matter. Let him go, brother.
-Loha… -Where are you going?
-You… -He didn't say anything that bad!
-Come back! -Brother!
-How dare he… -Gopal!
Stop, Gopal!
Brother!
-Where do you think you're going? -Stop, brother.
I'll come to your house and kill you!
Why are you getting so furious? What's wrong with you?
-Give me the gun. -Pointing a gun at your own brother?!
I apologize to you on his behalf.
You know how he is, brother. Leave it.
It's just a matter of one day.
It's okay.
Daddu!
JANSHAKTI PARTY HEAD OFFICE
You didn't tell me you're getting married.
Congratulations.
Brother, Jhulan…
I'll see you later.
My brother is crazy.
-I keep telling him-- -No, he's right.
It won't be right to send Daddu to Delhi now.
It will set a wrong example.
Get him out of this agitation first.
And find someone else to send to Delhi.
What you're saying is right, Mr. Tripathi,
but if I take Daddu out of the agitation,
the students will be scattered.
They'll revolt.
Until then, I'll decide whom to send to Delhi.
Gopal, have you lost your mind? Are you mad?
Yes, I have lost my mind.
First, you told me to mention Daddu's marriage in front of Tripathi.
-Gopal-- -Then, you slapped me.
I have had enough. I will kill you.
Calm down, Gopal.
Lower the gun. I did it all for you.
You never did anything for me. Never.
I'm your elder brother, you're my little brother.
Listen to me. Give me the gun.
No.
I said, give me the gun.
You want to shoot me?
Shoot me.
Shoot me.
Idiot.
What if you had shot me?
If I hadn't done what I did,
you wouldn't have got the chance to go to Delhi.
Delhi?
Me?
How?
Gopal, you ask too many questions.
You'll go to Delhi…
and I'll become the local MLA.
Like that.
I'll deal with the police and meet you on the highway.
-Okay? -Fine.
Why can't we go together?
Someone might recognize you.
This can be a problem.
Fine, finish your work and come back here. We'll leave together.
Why are you so worried?
Batru is with you.
Are you hiding something from me, Daddu?
Why-- What would I hide from you?
What do I have to hide?
Look…
I am not hiding anything from you.
I'll see you soon, okay?
See you.
Shall we?
Brother…
I don't like lying to Jhulan.
It's only for a day.
I've made arrangements for Jhulan and you.
-Dictatorship… -Down with it!
-Dictatorship… -Down with it!
-Mandal Commission… -Down with it!
-Mandal Commission… -Down with it!
-Mandal Commission… -Down with it!
-Mandal Commission… -Down with it!
-Commission… -Down with it!
-Commission… -Down with it!
-Commission… -Down with it!
Doesn't that road lead to the bypass?
I think you took a wrong turn.
No.
We'll take the next one.
Hey!
You eloped with Jhulan?!
This calls for a party.
I will throw a party, but I must tell you something important.
What?
Meet me after the agitation. I'll tell you.
Don't forget.
-Mandal Commission… -Down with it!
Daddu, here is a torch.
-Long live… -Daddu Bhaiya!
I forgot something at the hotel. Can you turn the car around?
Not now. It's getting late.
Please turn around. It's very urgent. Please.
Please, turn the car around.
Hey, sit quietly!
This is no way to talk.
-Stop the car. I said, stop the car! -Yeah.
I said, I won't stop the car.
We don't have time. We have to meet Daddu at twelve o'clock.
Stop the car, or I will scream. I am warning you.
-Long live… -Daddu Bhaiya!
-Commission… -Down with it!
-Commission… -Down with it!
Daddu will not spare you.
Daddu must have been taken care of.
You kill Batru, and I'll kill her.
-Down with it! -Down with it!
-Down with it! -Down with it!
But we were only ordered to kill the girl.
Are you out of your mind?
Brother said, "Kill them both."
No. That's not what he told me.
Run!
Hey!
-Hey! -Let go!
You…
Let go! It will go off!
-Let go of me! -Hey!
-Long live… -Daddu Thakur!
-Long live… -Daddu Thakur!
-Long live… -Daddu Thakur!
It will go off. Let go.
I will shoot you! Believe me, I will shoot you!
Batru! Stop, or else, I will shoot you!
Take your pants off, and stand over there! Batru!
Take it off!
Batru, let's go!
Turn around! Keep walking!
Take me to Daddu right now!
Don't look back!
-Long live… -Daddu Thakur!
-Long live… -Daddu Thakur!
-Long live… -Daddu Thakur!
-Long live… -Daddu Thakur!
Daddu!
Ranjan!
Someone get water!
What are you looking at?
What are you guys looking at?
Call the ambulance!
Ranjan!
Lift him!
Ranjan, open your eyes!
Ranjan! Open the ambulance doors!
Ranjan, you'll be okay. I promise you.
Ranjan. Hey.
Why isn't the ambulance moving?
Hey! Start the ambulance!
Where is the driver?
Daddu!
-Jhulan… -Daddu, are you okay?
What happened?
What happened?
What happened, Daddu?
Daddu, no! Daddu!
Sorry, Daddu.
Ranjan had to die.
But you just wait and watch.
Five hundred students will burn.
This will become a trend. Boys in every corner will immolate themselves.
We'll set the commission on fire.
Someone had to sacrifice.
You've done a great job.
What are you doing?
Hey! Who are you to hit me?
-Hey! -How dare you touch me!
Who are you?
You…
Give me the gun!
You called me your brother!
You called me your brother--
Why are you getting so sentimental? I just called you my younger brother…
I didn't adopt you!
If you had died instead of him, I would have become an MLA.
What was the harm if you had died?
Hey, don't!
No! Don't shoot!
Give me the gun!
Give me the gun!
-Gopal! -Brother, he shot me.
Gopal!
Gopal!
Hey!
Daddu!
Daddu! I'm begging you!
Please! Daddu, no!
No…
Hey, listen!
I must go.
Where is Ranjan?
Where is Ranjan?
No…
Why…
He died because of me.
I killed Ranjan.
If only I had studied…
He ruined my life.
You were right.
Ranjan was right.
All this is just politics.
Dirty politics.
I don't want this.
I lost Ranjan to it.
I don't want this.
I wasn't right, Daddu.
Ranjan was right.
You didn't play any politics. It was all Loha's doing.
What's happening now isn't politics.
Come with me.
Come.
-Long live… -Daddu Thakur!
-Long live… -Daddu Thakur!
Ranjan's life shouldn't go to waste.
-Long live… -Daddu Thakur!
-The government will have to bow down! -The government will have to bow down!
Go to the PM's office, Daddu.
-The government will have to bow down! -The government will have to bow down!
This reservation politics has heated things up in the entire country.
There's no stopping it.
This fire will burn for many years.
Many generations will be immolated.
This reservation has divided the country into backward and forward classes.
And the country has never benefited from any division.
Reservation is important.
But who's getting it is much more important.
The backward classes have been suppressed for thousands of years.
Now, it's time to bring them ahead.
But we need to make sure that no one else is burning
or suffering while we do that.
When a student has to attach his caste certificate
along with his academic certificate,
it means that importance is being given to his caste…
not his grades.
Whose marriage procession is it?
Ignore it. Concentrate on the game.
What the hell!
Hey! Stop the music!
Look at them, bursting firecrackers like crazy!
Are you planning to burst them inside someone's house now?
How dare the groom sit on a horse!
Get him down.
Do you think we'll let you pass through our lanes like that?
It's brave of you to come here wearing a turban, and dance in front of us!
Hey, you! Get down!
You can get back on the horse after you pass this lane.
Things were different back then, Mr. Thakur.
Times have changed now.
These young boys don't follow the old customs anymore.
Customs don't change with time!
Got it?
Why are you still sitting on the horse?
Kallan… get him down!
Don't force him to get down, Mr. Thakur.
-They're young. They're drunk right now. -Hey, move!
-It will create an unnecessary conflict. -Are you threatening me?
Do you think I'll get scared by your threat?
Kallan, get the scoundrel down!
-Get down! -Be quick!
-Come on! -Stop them, Mr. Thakur.
Don't you forget who you are, Roopram!
-Hey! -Move!
We are in their locality. They will make our lives miserable.
Get out of here!
Calm down.
We are almost done.
One last push.
-Use all your strength and push harder. -One last push.
That's it. We are done.
Go and get some clothes for the baby.
Here.
Hold the baby.
Yes, Auntie.
Is it a girl or a boy, Manju?
Grandma… it's a girl.
This is unfortunate!
Why don't you just die?
This is your fourth daughter.
Give her to me!
-I won't let you poison her, Mother. -Give her to me!
Open the door!
-What can I do if this is God's will? -Hapless woman!
Wretch!
You only give birth to girls!
How dare you argue with me!
Hand her over to me, quickly!
I won't do that, Mother!
What happened?
What happened to my son?
He was shot in the Thakur neighborhood. He died on the spot.
Oh, God! My dear son!
My child!
Roopram, why did you leave us so soon?
You have given birth to a witch!
She took her father's life!
One day, she will end up taking everyone's lives! Mark my words!
INDRAMANI TRIPATHI
LATE PROFESSOR DEVIDUTT COLLEGE
Come, let's have some fun.
Hello, madam.
I have been looking for a book, but I can't find it.
Which one?
The one written by Mr. Vatsyayana.
Kama Sutra.
LIBRARIAN
This broom will go up your derriere.
Get out of here before I take your IDs!
Scram!
They've barely learned to get it up, and they want to read Kama Sutra.
Whom do we want as our president?
Indu Bhaiya!
-Make way for… -Indu Bhaiya!
He will emerge victorious!
Indu Bhaiya will win!
He will emerge victorious!
Indu Bhaiya will--
Yes?
You can't campaign in the library without permission.
Well, then, give me your permission.
You will have to make a formal written request.
Where am I supposed to do that?
Here or in the hostel?
In the hostel.
INDRAMANI TRIPATHI
Mohit! Come on out, man!
INDRAMANI TRIPATHI FOR PRESIDENT
It's for you.
It's from Bombay.
-Wow! -It's quite expensive.
Tara doesn't wear cheap accessories, anyway.
I thought you'd give me a gift only after winning the election.
I'm going to win it, anyway.
Do you doubt it?
First step is to become the Student Union President.
That'll open doors to the legislative assembly election.
Then, I'll be a minister.
Then, maybe, I'll be the CM one day.
The CM, of course!
Learn to zip up your pants first.
Listen…
I didn't want to tell you…
but I am pregnant.
Again?
Couldn't you be more careful?
How is it my fault?
You should've taken the precaution.
You blamed me for this the last time as well.
Fine.
I'll ask Murari to take you to Lucknow. You can have an abortion.
I won't have an abortion this time.
What else will you do?
I want to get married.
To whom?
To you, of course.
Are you out of your mind?
Elections are just 15 days away.
How can you possibly think about getting married?
I'm not asking for a grand wedding.
Let's go and quietly get married in a temple.
We can tell everyone later.
What got you thinking about marriage out of the blue?
Look, I know…
your family won't accept this alliance.
But we cannot go on like this forever, Mr. Tripathi.
Why not?
We certainly can.
You can get married… to whoever you want.
And I'll get married to the one I am supposed to.
But I'll continue to love you… forever.
There's no need to get married for that.
So, you want me to be your mistress!
Well, it used to be a tradition.
Back in the day,
our forefathers used to have women of your caste as mistresses.
What's the big deal?
Well, then, I suggest you ask your forefathers…
if you were ever nursed by a mistress.
You are instigating me now.
I cannot stoop this low.
I swear upon my dear father…
I never promised to marry you.
I do love you…
and I'll do that for the rest of my life.
Give it a thought and let me know.
Don't run away, you bastard!
Stop!
Asshole!
Are you scared?
How dare you ask me to be your mistress!
You are nothing without these bootlickers.
Bloody coward!
Such a sissy!
You cannot even win the election of this insignificant college, Indramani!
-Hey… ignore her. -You've messed with the wrong girl!
You don't know me!
I'll distribute your love letters in the entire college and expose you!
I promise you that!
INDRAMANI TRIPATHI FOR PRESIDENT
I am not someone that you can just use and discard!
Student President, my foot!
He wants to be the CM someday! As if that's going to happen!
Look at his face!
Bloody coward!
Such a wimp!
He can't just use me like that!
I am not like other girls.
I'll make sure he doesn't win the college election.
Indu!
Couldn't you find anyone…
better than this girl?
What kind of a relationship do you have with her?
It's nothing, Dad.
I helped her get a job.
She's making a scene just because she's not getting a permanent position.
What if she says such things in public?
Tripathi family will be humiliated.
Please don't worry. I'll handle it.
I would like to know how.
-How do you intend to handle it? -I'll explain things to her.
I'll talk to her and clear the misunderstanding.
I can't just shoot people like you do.
Why not?
This is the beginning of your political career, Indu.
I have big dreams for you.
We cannot afford to have this thing ruin our image.
This involves a woman.
Get things under control.
Otherwise, forget becoming an MLA or a minister…
you won't even become a college president.
Got it?
Indu Bhaiya had called.
He asked me to take you to a doctor in Lucknow.
I told him it's not right to do this so often.
But what you did…
You threatened to campaign against him.
That's not right either.
Go tell your Bhaiya…
that I'll make sure he doesn't get a single vote this time.
Why are you messing with him?
-He's willing to talk things out. -Do you think I am scared of him?
Tell me.
You see what I am holding, right?
You'll get axed if you stay here any longer.
-Get going. -Fine, I'm going.
Go!
He came to my village to threaten me.
-Bloody dog. -Hello?
Bhaiya…
she won't budge.
Okay, Bhaiya.
People like you don't deserve any respect. You are unbelievably arrogant.
Bitch!
Stop hitting her face! Hit her in the stomach!
Get her!
Get her!
-Hold her tight! -Bablu!
Bablu!
Let go!
You…
How dare you!
Go away!
Get her! She's running away!
Hit her in the stomach!
How dare you threaten Indu Bhaiya!
Keep hitting her!
There you go!
Keep hitting her!
Get them!
Let's go!
PARIVARTAN PARTY OF INDIA MASTER SURAJBHAN (DIRECTOR)
It will sting a little bit. It's almost done.
You are…
Roopram's daughter, right?
-Did you know him? -Yes.
I also know how he died.
Our party had agitated…
on a large scale to seek compensation for his death.
Thank you.
We got 6,000 rupees compensation from the government.
Who else is there in your family?
My mom, my younger brother and I.
He's actually a cousin.
Everyone says that there has to be one male member in the house.
By the way…
who were those guys?
It's a personal matter.
Oh, really?
Do you openly get thrashed over a personal matter?
Sundar, go and get the disinfectant.
Okay.
I had inquired about this "personal matter" of yours.
His name is Indramani Tripathi, right?
Anyway… you can do as you please.
Stay here tonight.
I'll take you back to the village in the morning.
I don't want to go back to the village.
Then, what do you want to do?
I want to seek revenge.
I see.
And how is that going to help?
Will the system change if you kill some Indramani Tripathi?
Will they stop suppressing anyone who rebels for a change?
Or will that allow people from our caste to ride a horse and enter temples?
Powerful people have ruled with arrogance so far.
And their arrogance will be destroyed… by our rule.
Anyway, forget it.
Being self-centered is a sign of cowardice, Tara.
I will support you if you wish to do something for the community.
If you only wish to seek your personal revenge…
then you may leave.
Babasahib's image is so small.
-Right. -Pay attention to the details.
-Masterji. -If-- Yes?
Here are some offerings.
Mr. Kushwaha…
I'll start accepting offerings, when people of my community…
will be allowed inside temples.
Okay? Let's go. We've got a lot of work to do.
If we think about all this, then we--
Until when do you plan to ride a bicycle, Masterji?
Hop onto your new ride.
For whom are you doing this?
For yourself or for the community?
For you.
Let's go.
-Long live Parivartan Party! -Long live Parivartan Party!
Let's fight for a better future
Let's give wings to our dreams
Let go of all your fears
Keep your eyes on the stars and your feet on the ground
Spread your wings For it's time to fly
A NATION THAT FORGETS ITS PAST HAS NO FUTURE
For it's time to fly
Break free from all the shackles
Break free!
Spread your wings For it's time to fly
Break free from all the shackles
Make your spirits soar
Spread your wings For it's time to fly
Break free from all the shackles
Make your spirits soar
What is this, Masterji?
Your BP is once again quite low.
Tara, please ask him to get some rest.
I am tired of making him understand, Dr. Laxmi.
He doesn't listen to me.
Elections are just around the corner.
When do you expect me to work if not now?
Hail Bheem! Hail India!
Greetings to you, Masterji.
Masterji…
please accept this small gift.
Come closer. Over here.
Masterji, I know you are well-respected within the community.
You've made your party stronger by visiting different villages on a bicycle.
You'll give the biggies a run for their money
with your performance in the next assembly election.
However…
I'm not sure if you can win alone.
If we join hands…
and fight the next election…
then we'll certainly form the next government.
I have no doubts about it, Masterji.
Circumstances are in our favor.
If we join forces and attack, then…
we can even get Lucknow down on its knees.
You are here to form an alliance with us,
but you aren't even willing to drink the tea here.
Nothing like that. Give me that, madam.
It is indeed a great thought.
But unlike yours,
our party decisions are made unanimously, Mr. Arvind.
So, let all of us discuss this…
and get back to you with our decision.
I suggest you make the decision quickly, Masterji.
Rumor has it that the top brass in Lucknow
are willing to join hands with me.
I'm afraid someone else might contact me before you do.
Let's go.
Masterji…
I think we shouldn't accept Arvind Singh's proposal.
Collaborating with someone else to gain power goes against our purpose.
Masterji, this will open gates for others to follow suit.
Are we supposed to collaborate with everyone now?
Uncle, is this a political party or a drama group?
-In my opinion-- -Who asked for your opinion?
Do you have to interrupt when the senior party members are talking?
Please leave.
What are you doing?
Do you plan to break my leg?
Why did you scold me in front of everyone?
I didn't scold you.
I just made you understand. In front of senior leaders--
What if these senior leaders talk shit?
You…
I have told you so many times!
You need to mind your language.
She has no filter-- Tell me!
Did they say anything wrong?
Of course!
Uncle, you are the one who keeps saying
that the first step to bring about change is to change the reign.
And today, when the opportunity came knocking at our door…
the oldies started to freak out!
Okay, fine. You tell me what we should do.
Should we blindly collaborate with Arvind Singh
without giving it a thought?
Who said you should blindly accept it, Uncle?
Collaborate with him with your eyes wide open.
You should be ready to compromise, but on your terms.
Think about it, Uncle.
Imagine how much we'll be able to do for our people if one among us
gets elected as the MLA, the minister, or even the CM!
Give it a thought.
You seem to have an extensive knowledge of politics now.
I am your pupil.
If I don't learn about these things, then what's the use of being here?
Alright.
Do one thing.
Go and discuss the terms of the alliance with Arvind Singh.
-Me? -Yes.
You think you are an expert in politics.
So, prove yourself.
But please watch your language.
Don't worry, Uncle.
I only curse when needed.
It's not that I love to curse.
I'm pleased to hear that Masterji approves of our proposal.
But we have few conditions.
Our party will contest the election on 300 seats,
while yours will contest on 104 seats only.
After we win the elections, the CM will be chosen from our party.
Your party will get five ministers.
Well…
I wanted to form a cordial alliance,
but you seem to have far too many conditions going for it.
I had discussed this with Masterji.
We will take turns to appoint CM from our respectable parties.
But for the first two and a half years, the CM will be from our party.
Alright. I accept it.
But we will fight election on 202 seats out of the 404.
-Fifty-fifty. -Fifty-fifty.
That would make sense only if we have equal mass base.
Are you telling us that our mass base is less than yours, madam?
I'm not even talking to you.
Why are you interrupting?
Who is the party president, you or him?
That's enough. Please go.
What if I don't accept these conditions?
No.
You can't refuse.
Because you know that I am right.
But if you do refuse,
then I'll have you know that
many people have been wanting to contact Masterji as well.
In Lucknow as well as in Delhi.
So… I hope you reach a decision quickly.
I'm afraid someone else might contact him before you do.
Goodbye.
You, kiddo, should have Indian gooseberries.
It keeps the intestine clean and avoids slip of the tongue as well.
Thanks!
Who is that girl?
And how is she related to Masterji?
No one knows for sure.
I heard that she ran away from home,
and Masterji gave her shelter.
You could call her his pupil, co-worker or his mistress.
He just took her in, no questions asked.
Masterji, we've got applications from 20 candidates for each seat.
The workers are filled with enthusiasm.
This enthusiasm is what we sought, Mr. Kushwaha.
Mr. Ansari, how many applications have we got for Gauriganj?
None, Masterji.
Well, that is a difficult seat to win.
-Uncle? -Yes?
Why don't you make Tara Didi contest from there?
The outcome aside, it'll certainly be entertaining.
If she contests dressed like this even her family won't vote for her.
Just give me a chance, Uncle.
I'll have a complete makeover and give actresses a good run for their money.
That's the sitting CM's seat.
Forfeiture of security deposit is certain. Do you understand?
I won't show you my face again if that happens.
I promise I'll have the CM scrambling around to save his seat.
Listen up, residents of Gauriganj!
For the upliftment of the suppressed, repressed and backward class,
we present to you the joint candidate of Parivartan Party and Vikas Party!
Let's give a big round of applause and welcome Tara Roopram.
Tara Didi!
I hope she can give the speech, Mr. Kushwaha.
Masterji made a mistake by giving her a chance.
PARIVARTAN PARTY AND VIKAS PARTY GRAND ALLIANCE
How do I look?
Dynamic?
Bofors?
Hot?
Tell me!
Hot!
Right.
Well, I loved wearing jeans and t-shirt.
But these senior citizens said,
"Tara, you are contesting an election.
You should change your getup."
So, I wore a sari.
By the way…
I'm contesting this election neither to win…
nor to lose.
I just want to find out one thing.
For the last 15 years, Masterji has been going around
different villages on his bicycle.
Has that had any effect on you people
or were all his efforts futile?
I only want to talk about…
our community
and our people in this legislative sector.
Because no one else really cares about you!
Be it the sectarian electoral symbol,
the turban electoral symbol,
or the coffer electoral symbol.
And that's why I say…
it's time to boot the dictators out!
In conclusion, I would like to tell my young friends that…
I am single. I am sharp like a dagger.
And I am all yours!
Who should be our leader?
Tara Roopram!
Who should be our leader?
This is for you.
And this is for you. Here you go.
Listen! Please greet the CM from a distance.
Okay? Don't touch him.
Elections are just around the corner.
Chief Minister Devendra Prasad Singh had lunch at a Dalit's residence
to change his image and appease the backward vote bank.
Let's see whether this move
helps him get any backward and Dalit votes.
Madam, do you actually believe that this act is real?
I don't care whether it's real or not.
My job is to report, and that's what I've done.
I see.
Then report this as well.
Excuse me.
-Hello! -Point the camera at her.
Hey, Mr. CM!
Mr. Chief Minister! Hello!
You came over uninvited because the election is approaching, right?
If you are so interested in eating at our place,
then why don't you eat what we eat?
Eat stale or leftover food. Have people's half-eaten meals.
Eat a dead rat.
Only then we will know that you have empathy towards us!
You won't get votes of the poor just because you're eating
a five-star restaurant's food in their plates!
People have learned the truth.
These acts will no longer work!
Come on, madam. Let's go.
-Long live… -Tara Roopram!
-Long live… -Tara Roopram!
-Long live… -Tara Roopram!
-Long live… -Tara Roopram!
-Long live… -Tara Roopram!
-Long live… -Tara Roopram!
-Long live… -Tara Roopram!
-Long live… -Tara Roopram!
-Long live… -Tara Roopram!
-Long live… -Tara Roopram!
-Long live… -Tara Roopram!
-Long live… -Tara Roopram!
-Long live… -Tara Roopram!
Breaking news coming in!
Some unidentified men took a shot at Tara Roopram,
the youth leader of the Parivartan Party, who is contesting the election
against CM D.P. Singh in the legislative sector of Gauriganj,
while she was campaigning.
I am not scared of their bullets or attacks.
There's only one thing I'd like to say to the CM.
This newbie is going to have you run for the hills.
Mark my words.
The person whose victory will be celebrated
outside the counting center will be Tara.
Tara Roopram.
WHO WILL BE THE NEXT CHIEF MINISTER?
Master Surajbhan's Parivartan Party and Arvind Singh's Vikas Party
are leading the state assembly elections.
From the counting done so far,
we have learned that this alliance has won 180 seats,
and their candidates are taking lead against their opponents by 60 seats.
Breaking news coming in!
Chief Minister D.P. Singh has lost the election
from the Gauriganj assembly seat.
Parivartan Party's youth candidate Tara Roopram
gave him a tough competition and won the election by more than 3000 votes.
-Long live… -Tara Didi!
-Long live… -Tara Didi!
-Long live… -Tara Didi!
-Long live… -Tara Didi!

I congratulate everyone for winning the elections.
-Long live… -Parivartan Party!
-Long live… -Parivartan Party!
-Long live… -Masterji!
-Long live… -Masterji!
Exactly 15 years ago, I had formed this party with this very aim.
Being in power is a unique experience.
On the one hand, it gives you the opportunity to serve people.
And on the other hand, this kind of power can corrupt you.
We should never forget one thing.
For the Parivartan Party,
this power is just a stepping stone,
and not the ultimate goal.
Like all of you know…
we now need to form a government in alliance with Vikas Party.
But before that, I would like to discuss something very important.
We need to select a candidate from our party…
for the post of Chief Minister.
I would like everyone to give their suggestions.
So, tell me.
Which candidate do you see as your future Chief Minister?
Masterji, I think our CM candidate should be
a senior member with a lot of experience.
Mr. Kushwaha is the senior most member of our party after you.
I would like to suggest his name.
-That's good. -Yes, Mr. Kushwaha is the ideal candidate.
-Long live… -O.P. Kushwaha!
-Long live… -O.P. Kushwaha!
-Long live… -O.P. Kushwaha!
-Long live… -O.P. Kushwaha!
-Long live… -O.P. Kushwaha!
Mr. Kushwaha, just give me some time.
-Long live… -O.P. Kushwaha!
Alright.
Let me ponder on this.
I'll let you know my decision soon.
Why does Masterji need to think about it?
Chief Minister?
Stop lying!
Who will make you the CM?
Quit daydreaming about it! You won the election by fluke.
Are you serious?
Will you really be the CM?
I mean… the CM of Uttar Pradesh?
Do you want to ride in a car with red beacon?
Come again?
Do you want to ride in a car with red beacon?
I wore a helmet and used a locally made gun to take a shot at you,
and you're going to be the CM!
I didn't know this would happen.
I had promised Uncle that I'd defeat the CM.
That's why I had to take your help.
I, Tara Roopram, do swear in the name of God,
that I will bear true faith and allegiance,
to the Constitution of India as by law established.
I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India.
I will faithfully and conscientiously
discharge my duties as the Chief Minister of the state.
And I will do right to all manner of people,
in accordance with the constitution and the law,
without fear or favor, affection or ill-will.
-Jai Hind, madam. -Jai Hind.
I am Danish Rehman Khan, your OSD.
-Your entourage is here. This way, please. -Let's go.
-Long live Tara Didi! -Long live Tara Didi!
-Long live our new Chief Minister! -Long live our new Chief Minister!
-Long live Tara Didi! -Long live Tara Didi!
-Long live our new Chief Minister! -Long live our new Chief Minister!
SWEARING-IN CEREMONY
Such a big house!
Who else is going to stay here?
It is our house, Mom.
We will be staying here.
There is a pond and a fountain outside, Tara.
Now, there will be no shortage of water to wash our clothes.
You will no longer need to wash clothes, Mom.
Now, you will live like a queen here.
Had your grandma been alive, she would have seen
the roaring success of the girl
she intended to poison at birth.
This has been possible because of you, Masterji.
May God bless you with a long life.
This is just the beginning for Tara.
She has a long road ahead of her.
Sundar, go and get us a rickshaw.
Where are you going, Uncle?
I'm going back home.
You are the elected representative of the people.
I will stay with the people as their guard.
And you better get this straight.
If you make a mistake,
your Uncle won't refrain from reprimanding you.
I have you by my side.
You won't let me make any mistake.
UTTAR PRADESH GOVERNMENT
Madam, Uttar Pradesh is the biggest state of our country.
It's very difficult to run it.
So, I have divided Uttar Pradesh into five zones.
I've studied that this method will make it easier for us to implement schemes.
-Okay. -Like this entire area of Bundelkhand
is extremely backward.
Sir!
The president of Vikas Party has sent this file.
What is it?
It's a list from Mr. Arvind Singh consisting names
of those who will become ministers as per his quota.
Amazing!
Arvind sent the list as soon as I joined the office!
Madam, the first name on this list is Yuvraj Singh Yadav.
He is Mr. Arvind Singh's maternal uncle.
Okay.
The second name is Mahesh Kumar Malvi.
Mr. Malvi is a renowned businessman
who funds all his elections.
Right!
The third name is Anil Chaudhary.
He is Mr. Arvind's childhood friend.
I see.
The fourth name is Mohammad Rafiq-ul Haq.
He used to be Mr. Arvind's father's bodyguard.
Arvind has formed a kitchen cabinet.
-So it seems. -There's nothing he can do.
It's a coalition government.
Madam, the fifth name on the list is Indramani Tripathi.
Madam, he's a first-time MLA.
He has been a part of student politics.
Is he the one from Hussainganj Degree College?
Yes.
You are from the same college, right?
You might know him.
No. I don't remember him.
So…
after Bundelkhand comes Lucknow and…
When are we celebrating Raksha Bandhan this year?
Continuing with the traditions of Raksha Bandhan,
Chief Minister Tara Roopram tied a rakhi to Arvind Singh,
her alliance partner and the President of Vikas Party.
Only time will tell how long this bond will last
and keep this coalition together.
This way, madam.
God is merciful!
Tell me, madam.
What should I gift you on Raksha Bandhan?
What do I ask for, brother?
You have given me everything.
But we still need to follow the customs of this festival.
Tell me, what do you want?
I want you to strike off one name from your list of ministers.
Whose name?
Indramani Tripathi.
Indu?
Why?
What has that poor man done to you?
Won't I get the gift without giving you a reason?
Nothing like that, madam.
He is like a brother to me.
I joined politics after his father showed me the ropes.
You see…
I cannot displease him in order to fulfill your wish.
Madam, I don't know if there's some issue between you and Indramani.
But it will be difficult to strike him off the list.
And what if I say it will be difficult for me to make him a minister?
Are you threatening me?
That too on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan?
Listen, madam.
You ought to ignore trivial matters in politics.
If you let things keep hurting your pride…
you will end up losing your pride completely.
Besides, our party has the right to make this decision.
Did I question Masterji's decision
of making you the CM instead of Mr. Kushwaha?
You didn't deserve the post.
And yet, you ended up becoming the CM.
I defeated the sitting CM, brother.
Who deserves the post if not me, perhaps Mahinder Singh Dhoni?
I understood her character the day I met her for the first time.
Just wait and watch…
how I use Indu to control her for the next two and a half years.
It's not a big deal.
It's a coalition government.
One has to often accept such decisions.
Heed my advice and don't exaggerate the matter.
Just focus on your work and forget about Indramani Tripathi.
Forget about him?
Forget about the man who ruined my reputation?
Uncle, I feel like castrating him! How can I make him a minister?
You want me to compromise?
Uncle, if I compromise on this matter,
they'll make me compromise on some other matter tomorrow.
If I give in today, I'll always be compelled to do as they say.
This is what that bloody Arvind Singh wants!
What will you do then?
You want to dissolve the government over such a trivial matter?
A trivial matter?
You are supporting him instead of me!
Why don't you understand?
Why don't you understand?
I cannot let the government suffer on account of your personal grudges.
This is my order.
Let Indramani Tripathi become a minister and end this matter.
And what if I don't?
-Will you go against me? -Yes.
I will go against you if you are wrong, Uncle.
Quit being stubborn, Tara.
I won't.
I cannot make compromises for a political gain, Uncle.
There's no way Indramani Tripathi will become a minister.
Look, madam, I'm not being stubborn here.
I'm only following traditions.
Some people just aren't allowed inside temples.
And if I break with tradition,
there will be a ruckus.
It could become an issue of law and order.
They are allowed to seek blessings from outside, madam.
Besides, God is present everywhere.
Both inside and outside the temple.
Alright then, close its doors for everyone.
All those who wish to seek God's blessings can do it from outside.
-Okay? -We cannot do that, madam.
It'll be better if we retain the arrangement.
The arrangement!
I don't like this arrangement, sir.
You guys have claimed rights
over the only thing that belongs to everyone.
I'm going inside to pray to God.
You're well aware of my caste as well as my status.
If you create a ruckus out here,
I'll have you stripped and thrashed.
Madam, I suggest the we don't break the arrangement…
Who is he?
Madam, he's the DM.
Did I ask you for your suggestion?
Do you want to get transferred to Banaras?
You can spend all your time in the temples there.
Go and get me a veneration plate.
-Sorry, madam. -He's giving me suggestions!
Get the holy water.
We will have to purify the whole courtyard.
-Long live… -Tara Madam!
-Long live… -Tara Madam!
-Long live… -Tara Madam!
-Long live… -Tara Madam!
-Long live… -Tara Madam!

Hello, madam.
Look at this.
STRAINED ALLIANCE BETWEEN TARA AND ARVIND
And this one.
Mr. Arvind Singh is trying to turn the press against you.
Do you understand his game?
I understand everything, Mr. Khan.
It will certainly anger a few people.
But all of this will only strengthen our vote bank.
I'll be the CM only for two and a half years, Mr. Khan.
But I'll serve the people so well that
they'll remember me for the next many years.
Madam.
An MLA is here to meet you.
Greetings!
I thought you are upset with me.
So, I thought I should meet you.
How dare you barge in like that?
Look…
I have come here with a request.
Let bygones be bygones.
Appoint me as a minister and give me a chance to serve the people.
You are the CM now.
It is beneath you to seek revenge for the past.
If you don't let go of the past, I'll be reminded of it as well.
I still have many fond memories of room number 56
of the boys' hostel in my mobile phone.
Mind your language, sir.
Mr. Khan, you please wait outside and send Bablu in.
Sure, madam.
Didn't your father die last month?
What kind of a son are you?
Senior Tripathi passed away,
and you didn't even shave your head out of respect!
I'm an old flame of yours.
So, let me help you with it.
Do not move.
Don't move, or else you'll be hurt.
BAJRANGBALI TEMPLE
-Mr. Kushwaha. -Yes?
What are the updates?
I'm working on the task you had assigned me.
I have spoken to most of the MLAs.
Almost everyone in the party has agreed.
What about Masterji?
He is very upset with Tara Madam after what she did to Indramani.
He isn't feeling well.
He has gone to Faizabad Circuit House to get some rest.
-Would you do me a favor? -Sure.
Invite all the MLAs for dinner.
Okay.
Let's get together and come up with a plan.
We need to hurry.
The CM is becoming very popular by building new roads and dams.
I also heard there's metro coming up in Lucknow.
Mr. Kushwaha, let me tell you something.
The one who builds metro here, always loses the elections.
And the one who builds a temple, wins it.
OFFICIAL CIRCUIT HOUSE, FAIZABAD (UTTAR PRADESH)
Is he taking his medicines on time?
No, Tara Didi.
He doesn't take it even when I keep it on his bedside.
He has grown so weak.
I thought he would get some rest here, at the Circuit House.
But he doesn't get any chance to rest.
Why? Who's disturbing him over here?
Someone or other keeps showing up from Lucknow.
-From Lucknow? -Yes.
There's Mr. Kushwaha, Mr. Ansari,
some MLAs and ministers.
And Mr. Arvind has also been visiting him for the last few days.
How will he possibly rest amidst all of this?
-Didi. -Yes?
May I ask you something?
Sure.
Why are all these people against you?
They all come here and criticize you.
They are scared of me.
What about Uncle?
Looks like some big shot lives here.
The Chief Minister herself is here to cook!
Uncle!
God bless you.
The aroma is amazing!
What are you making right now?
Your favorite dishes.
Lithi chokha and moong dal halwa.
Wonderful!
I'm good.
Uncle is enjoying his meal after a long time.
Well… how often do I get to relish a meal cooked by the CM?
Why are you standing here? Go. Get me some halwa.
I'm fine. Thanks, dear.
I will go to sleep.
I have called the MLAs for a meeting tomorrow.
I think you should resign.
Running a government is very complicated, dear.
I'll resign if you ask me to.
But may I ask the reason?
Everyone seems to be upset with you.
Who is everyone?
Kushwaha?
The one who couldn't become the CM because of me?
Or Arvind Singh…
who has been wanting to become the CM before my tenure ends?
They have been talking behind my back
and trying to turn you against me.
They have even incited my MLAs and ministers.
I never came to you complaining about anyone, Uncle.
Your incessant arguments have only increased
ever since you became the CM.
I didn't say anything when you didn't make Indramani Tripathi a minister.
I didn't say anything even when you tonsured him in your office.
And your brother, Bablu…
I get complaints about him every day.
I still don't say anything.
Media criticizes your government's policies every day.
Did I ever question you?
What policies?
What policies, Uncle?
Is it wrong to let the backward class enter the temple?
Is it wrong to distribute bicycles to girls?
Is it wrong to build roads, schools and metro?
Why don't you understand, Uncle?
I'm doing exactly what you wanted to do.
My efforts are only strengthening the party.
And that scoundrel Arvind Singh cannot digest that.
He goes to the media and talks trash about me--
He's trying to ruin my reputation, Uncle!
-They are conspiring against me. -Enough!
That's enough.
It didn't take you long to become a dirty politician.
Right?
Just because you have to bear a little criticism,
you're accusing them of conspiring against you.
-Uncle, try to understand-- -I don't want to argue about this anymore.
I'm saying this for your own good.
You try to understand.
In politics…
when you start losing the support of your own people,
the best thing to do is to step down.
Have I lost your support as well, Uncle?
Switch off the lights on your way out.
OFFICIAL CIRCUIT HOUSE, FAIZABAD (UTTAR PRADESH)
I've been told that…
you are not pleased with the Chief Minister's performance,
and wish to have a new Chief Minister.
I can understand.
This being a coalition government,
and our Chief Minister being inexperienced,
makes the matter a little complicated.
I know that the Chief Minister has made mistakes.
She has made many mistakes.
Your anger and all your complaints
are completely justified.
After giving some thought to this matter,
I have decided that…
the Chief Minister will not be changed.
Tara Roopram shall continue to be the Chief Minister.
Because I do not have doubts
about Tara's intentions and capability.
Mr. Arvind…
if you are unhappy with my decision,
you are free to withdraw your support.
I am okay with dissolving the government,
but I cannot approve of changing the Chief Minister.
My decision is final.
You are our guide.
I accept your decision, Masterji.
I support you…
as well as the Chief Minister and the government.
-Long live our governance! -Long live our governance!
-Long live Tara's governance! -Long live Tara's governance!
-Long live our unity! -Long live our unity!
-Long live our unity! -Long live our unity!
-Long live our unity! -Long live our unity!
-Long live our unity! -Long live our unity!
You should know, you still have a father.
OFFICIAL CIRCUIT HOUSE, FAIZABAD (UTTAR PRADESH)
I served Masterji for many years, Bhaiyaji.
Everyone associated with him gained something or the other.
They became MLAs and ministers.
One even ended up becoming the Chief Minister.
I'm the only one who didn't gain anything.
You are the first person to think about me, Bhaiyaji.
Do you know why you didn't gain anything, Sundar?
Because you don't understand politics.
Masterji is no more, Arvind Bhaiya.
The CM is all alone.
And I will kill her.
He shall live on forever!
-Masterji shall live on forever! -He shall live on forever!
-Masterji shall live on forever! -He shall live on forever!
As long as the sun shines…
Masterji will be remembered!
As long as the sun shines…
Masterji will be remembered!
As long as the sun shines…

If you make a mistake,
your Uncle won't refrain from reprimanding you.
I have you by my side.
You won't let me make any mistake.
You should know, you still have a father.
-Masterji shall live on forever! -He shall live on forever!
-Masterji shall live on forever! -He shall live on forever!
-Masterji shall live on forever! -He shall live on forever!
-Masterji shall live on forever! -He shall live on forever!

Sir!
Sir!
Sir, please come out!
Sir!
Open the door, sir!
Sir, there's a problem!
-Sir-- -I'll slap you!
-Sir-- -What's wrong?
There's a big problem.
I've been trying to contact you, but your phone is switched off.
What happened? Did the CBI raid us?
It's something far worse.
The CM has abducted all the MLAs of our party.
What do you mean?
Sir, Tara kidnapped all the MLAs of our party.
-Where did she take them? -State Guest House.
She will make them parade
in front of the Governor tomorrow in a show of strength.
She has split your party.
How dare she!
I won't spare her.
Wake the boys up!
Get all the arms and ammunition loaded.
-Listen! -Yes?
-Call up Indu. -Okay, sir.
Hurry up!
That wretch!
She wants to split our party.
PLEASE STOP LUCKNOW POLICE
MASTER SURAJBHAN GUEST HOUSE UTTAR PRADESH GOVERNMENT
-She is here. -Mr. Sharma, talk to her.
This is not right, madam.
This is hooliganism!
-That's right! -This is hooliganism!
I apologize for the way all of you were brought here.
And I apologize if you were mistreated by my men.
But I also feel sorry about the condition you are in.
I have a question to ask.
What did you gain from Arvind Singh's leadership?
He only let his family members, friends and lackeys
become ministers.
All contracts were granted only to his friends and family.
They have managed to double their profits in six months!
Whereas you need to seek permission
to even install a hand pump in your sector.
This is how he treats you!
It seems difficult, Bhaiya.
The place is tightly secured.
But the news has been confirmed.
All the MLAs will stay here tonight,
and leave for the Governor House at 9:00 a.m.
Danish Khan is the mastermind behind this.
Who is the SP on duty?
Alok Yadav.
-Call him. -Yes, sir.
Give him what he wants.
Just ask him to keep the back gate open for some time.
Now, hear me out.
If all of you leave Vikas Party and join my party,
then I shall make each one of you a minister.
Jai Hind, sir.
Jai Hind, sir.
Take a break and have some tea.
Take them along as well.
Okay, sir.
I'll handle everything here.
Go on.
Come on, guys.
LUCKNOW TRAFFIC POLICE
Sir.
Please make it quick, sir.
Everyone will be back in 15 minutes.
In the next one hour, you'll receive gold weighing as much as you do.
This way, sir.
Are the arrangements in order, Mr. Khan?
Yes, madam.
We have turned this Guest House into a fortress.
Not even the Prime Minister can get in without your permission.
Where are our MLAs?
They are at Clarks Avadh Hotel, under police protection.
You don't worry. Bablu is with them.
They will reach the Governor House at nine in the morning,
and sign the affidavit pledging their support to you.
Stop. What is this?
It's dinner for madam.
What--
That's her room, Bhaiyaji.
That one.
Keep an eye on the security.
Okay, sir.
What the hell!
Where did she go?
Where is that bitch?
Check the bathroom.
She's not in the bathroom, Bhaiyaji.
She's not?
Where the hell is she?
She could be in some other room.
Check each and every room.
Get all the MLAs out.
Bloody traitors! They bit the hand that fed them!
Go!
Check properly!
Check everywhere!
Find them!
Come on, man!
Check properly! Go that way!
Come on.
Scour the rooms!
-Check properly! -There's no on here, sir.
Go there!
Where did she go?
Alpha to Delta.
Where are all the MLAs?
What happened, Indu?
How is this possible?
Alpha to Delta.
Something is not right.
Go upstairs and check.
There is no one upstairs either.
All the rooms are empty.
Where the hell did all the 44 MLAs go?
Sir!
You should leave.
The commandos are headed this way.
How can I just leave?
Where could they possibly go?
They can't just vanish into thin air.
I can't leave without them.
-Sir. -We should leave, Arvind Bhaiya.
We will get another opportunity.
Please let's go.
Where did they go?
How could they disappear?
Sir, hurry up or they'll get us!
Let's go!
Please hurry!
Sir!
Indu!
Mr. Khan!
Run! The police are here!
Sir!
Move!
-Excuse me. -That's Danish, right?
Arvind Singh, the president of Vikas Party,
and MLA Indramani Tripathi
made an attack on Chief Minister Tara Roopram.
Danish Rehman Khan, the CM's OSD, has been seriously injured in the attack.
Check over there.
I wasn't even in town.
I was in Barabanki, offering prayers…
Stop! Sir, please stop!
-Sir! -Bloody hell.
The Crime Branch raided Arvind Singh's residence and arrested him.
Let me go!
They also found a lot of illegal weaponry there.
However, MLA Indramani Tripathi,
who had fired the shots, has managed to escape.
Senior police officers believe that he has fled to Nepal.
The revelations have caused a division in Vikas Party.
Majority of its MLAs have decided to join CM Tara Roopram's party.
I, do swear in the name of God…
That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the CM.
That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the CM.
-My loyalties lie… -My loyalties lie…
-with the CM. -with the CM.
This I declare and affirm.
This I declare and affirm.
For the first time following formation of her own government,
after Vikas Party's MLAs joined her,
Chief Minister Tara Roopram went to her village, Rajakhera.
In a program called Government At Your Doorstep,
the Chief Minister heard people's grievances,
and declared that all their problems will be resolved very soon.
It gives me a sense of peace
to be back here.
Girls who went to school with me already have a couple of kids.
Imagine…
if I had stayed here, I would also be nurturing kids like the others.
I would be making dung cakes.
Madam, didn't you ever think about getting married?
Sorry, madam. I…
I spoke impulsively.
I shouldn't have said that. I'm really sorry.
Will you marry me, Mr. Khan?
Excuse me?
Will… you… marry me?
-Long live… -Tara Madam!
-Long live… -Tara Madam!
-Long live… -Tara Madam!
How do I look?
Hot!
Extremely hot?
Extremely hot!
Today is my birthday.
My party MLAs have…
gifted me this necklace.
Now, the media is going to make fun of me.
Why?
The opposition will make accusations against me.
Why?
Because they cannot bear to see a poor man's daughter
dressed like this.
And to be honest…
I thoroughly enjoy the fact that they are envious!
Because… I am bold.
I am sharp like a dagger.
And I am all yours!
I don't believe in hiding anything.
I like to do things openly…
and unashamedly.
So, today,
on my birthday,
I would like to give you all a gift.
So, here goes.
Today…
on this very stage…
and at this very moment…
I'm going to get married.
And the name of my future husband is…
Danish Rehman Khan.
Happy birthday to you!
Happy wedding day to you!
So, what do you all think?
Do you approve of him as my husband?
We approve of him!
You know, Mr. Khan, I have never been afraid of anything in life.
Everyone knows that. You are very brave.
Yes, but not as brave as I seem.
I got really scared…
the day you were shot.
Why?
I felt quite lonely… after Uncle passed away.
But ever since you came along,
I started feeling a sense of peace.
You deserve all the happiness.
You have been accused of conspiring to kill the Chief Minister.
Do you have anything to say in your defense?
Your Honor…
that's not true.
They threatened and bought off our MLAs.
They caused a split in our party.
Our young MLA…
Indramani Tripathi is still missing, Your Honor.
Moreover, I'm being accused of hatching this conspiracy.
Your Honor, my client has the right to participate
in the assembly session and perform other duties.
And I would like to bring to your attention
that they didn't seek permission
of the speaker of the Legislative Assembly before arresting him.
Legally, it is mandatory for them to do so.
-Legislator. -Yes, sir.
I'm granting you bail.
Thank you, Your Honor.
-Congratulations, sir! -Come on.
Congratulations, sir!
I will kill you.
It took you four months to bail me out!
-Oh, Dr. Laxmi! -This way, ma'am.
It's good to see you.
How are you?
I'm glad that the CM recognized me.
How can I not recognize you?
We go way back.
That's true.
How are you doing?
Good.
But you don't seem well.
Take a deep breath.
Good.
There's nothing to worry about.
You have a mild fever.
I'll prescribe a few medicines.
You should rest for a couple of days.
Everything will be fine.
You've prescribed medicines only for the fever, doctor.
She's complaining of body ache and nausea as well.
You should prescribe something for that as well.
If you don't mind, what do you specialize in?
I'll have you know that she is my friend.
Madam, I suggest that you consult a specialist.
It's nothing serious.
I'll be completely fine after taking the medicines she has prescribed.
You may get back to work.
Go.
She's my new secretary.
-Shashi. -I see.
I'll take your leave now.
Take care of yourself.
Make sure to have the medicines on time.
Keep visiting, Dr. Laxmi.
-Mom! -Yes?
What's for breakfast?
I want to have something nice.
The medicines have left a bad taste in my mouth.
Join us.
I have made your favorite aloo sabzi, puri and dahi-jalebi.
Awesome!
Sorry, madam. You cannot have that.
Why not?
It's the doctor's order.
This is what you will have.
Why are you after my life?
I don't want to eat this crap!
She means well.
You will fall sick again if you don't stick to the diet.
Did you take your medicine?
You forgot?
Give it to her.
She has been feeding me bland boiled food ever since she joined.
She has also changed all the servants.
And she has hired a good-for-nothing English chef.
Let her do her job.
You are supporting her, Mr. Khan?
The Chief Minister should resign!
The Chief Minister should resign!
-Down with murderous Tara! -Down with murderous Tara!
Listen up, friends!
The lady living like a queen in this grand house…
isn't the Chief Minister…
but a murderer!
You're well aware
of the guest house incident
and the disappearance of our party's young MLA Indramani Tripathi.
This murderous Chief Minister is responsible for both!
-Down with murderous Tara! -Down with murderous Tara!
-Down with murderous Tara! -Down with murderous Tara!
Dear friends! With all of you as my witnesses…
MURDEROUS TARA
I hold this holy water and pledge that…
I shall fast until death right outside the Chief Minister's residence…
until my request
for a CBI probe is accepted.
-We want… -CBI probe!
-We want… -CBI probe!
Thank you so much for meeting us.
You are a clever man.
I'm sure you know what this is all about.
Cut to the chase, Mr. Kushwaha.
We met the President in Delhi.
The orders for a CBI probe will be issued in a couple of days.
You know what caused a split in our party and what happened to Indu.
As per rules, they should interrogate you as well, Mr. Khan.
So, make it happen.
-Who is stopping you? -Hold on.
We are not here to argue.
We have a proposal for you.
The Chief Minister is certain to end up in prison after the CBI probe.
If you push all the other MLAs towards us after she gets arrested…
then we guarantee you a seat in the Council of States.
You are a well-educated, intellectual man.
You should be handling national politics.
This is what we are proposing.
What's wrong, Mr. Khan?
You have an opportunity to be in the Council of States.
What's there to think about?
I'm thinking whether I should take of my shoe and hit you in the head,
or disrobe you and turn your derriere red.
Show some respect.
You don't deserve respect!
The Chief Minister is my wife.
And as long as I live,
I won't let anybody harm a hair on her head.
You should have called me over, madam.
Why did you take the trouble to come here?
I was passing by. So, I thought of stopping for a quick checkup.
What is wrong with me, Laxmi?
I have never been this unwell before.
There's something happening every week.
Don't worry. We will run a couple of tests.
Madam, your phone.
Excuse me.
Yes, Mr. Khan?
Mr. Khan, the CBI has summoned her.
She will have to go to court.
-What are the chances? -Hundred percent.
CBI will seek custody.
Looking at the sensitivity of the issue,
court will issue arrest orders.
The CBI Judge Supriya Tiwari is really strict.
How many days will I have to spend in prison, sir?
You're not going to prison.
We won't go to court.
-End of story. -For how long?
If I keep delaying, people will think that I am hiding something.
For how many days will I have to go to prison?
About four to six months, madam. But you'll be granted bail after that.
Can't we seek an anticipatory bail?
We can even approach the Supreme Court.
-No. -Yes, but…
There's no need.
You should leave.
Okay, madam.
I will go to jail, Mr. Khan.
People will sympathize with me if I go to jail.
It will help during the election.
If you go to jail, who will run the government?
You will.
Me?
Look, please don't get me into this mess.
We have many senior leaders.
You can make one of them do it.
I have already taken away your government job by marrying you.
Now, I need to give you something in return.
You will handle everything until I come back.
The party, this house and the government.
I can handle the household, but…
Do you remember who was made the CM when Mr. Lalu went to jail?
Do you plan to change my name as well?
Madam.
You have been accused of buying off the MLAs of Vikas Party,
and filing false charges against the party's president, Arvind Singh.
And the CBI also suspects that you have a hand
in the disappearance of MLA Indramani Tripathi.
Would you like to say something in your defense?
I have not said anything in my defense to this day.
So, why would I do that do?
I'm sure my lawyers know their job.
You may have a seat.
UTTAR PRADESH GOVERNMENT
Your Honor, there have been numerous occasions wherein
the High Court and the Supreme Court
have issued orders to arrest sitting CMs.
All the referred cases have been mentioned in the file.
Sir?
Yes?
Come in.
Sir, I'm here with my CV for the post of the new CM's OSD.
Let me take a look.
Let me see what your qualifications are.
How can I possibly give you
the CM's custody on the basis of an initial investigation?
But, Your Honor…
She is the Chief Minister of our state.
She isn't going to run away.
Mr. Khan?
You sick bastard!
-Bablu. -Danish.
-Listen, Bablu… -Stay right there.
-Listen to me. -Stay there!
-Listen… -I said stay right there!
I knew you were treacherous.
-Wait and see how I expose you. -Listen to me, Bablu!
Shut up!
You may continue with your investigation.
You will get her custody once you have evidence against her.
As of now, I'm declining your appeal.
Madam, please hear me out.
Counsel, please settle down.
Damn it! She isn't answering her phone!
That bloody traitor!
Stop the car!
Come here.
Don't you know whose car it is?
Can't you see whose car it is?
I'll behead you right here!
Buzz off!
-Long live… -Tara Madam!
In a dramatic turn of events,
the court declined CBI's appeal to grant them
the custody of Chief Minister Tara Roopram.
All the legal experts had claimed that
the Chief Minister would certainly to go to jail.
The decision of the court has caused a stir in the state.
And given the circumstances, it is uncertain
if the Chief Minister's husband will be taking the oath tomorrow.
-Long live… -Tara Madam!
-Long live… -Tara Madam!
-Long live… -Tara Didi!
-Long live… -Tara Madam!
-Go ahead with your endeavors, Tara! -You have our support!
-Go ahead with your endeavors, Tara! -You have our support!
-Go ahead with your endeavors, Tara! -You have our support!
-Long live… -Tara Madam!
-Long live… -Tara Madam!
-Long live… -Tara Madam!
Poison me?
Have you lost your mind, Laxmi?
I was just as surprised as you are.
That's why I had sent all your samples to AIIMS, New Delhi.
Their investigation also conclude that
something is being mixed in your meals which is making you…
How come I didn't die if I was poisoned?
Its outcome is not sudden death.
It's a slow process which leads to gradual death.
You could have had a heart attack or a paralysis attack.
But I have been only eating homemade food.
And you know that I live with my mom, Bablu and…
what's her name? Shashi!
Mr. Khan is the one who appointed Shashi.
I eat whatever she asks me to.
So, Mr. Khan…
There has been another development.
We have unconfirmed reports of the CM's brother Bablu Roopram
dying in a police encounter.
Our sources suggest that he shot at the police officers
under the influence of alcohol,
and was killed during the crossfire.
No statement has been released by the CMO so far.
Mr. Khan.
There was a call from the Governor's office.
Your swearing-in ceremony has been called off.
This is your personal matter, madam.
I may be speaking out of turn…
but I suggest that you don't trust anyone.
And…
Mr. Khan…
Well, everyone in Lucknow has heard rumors about him.
He is my husband.
I love him.
He took a bullet for me.
Sorry, madam. You cannot have that.
I don't want to eat this crap!
She means well.
You will fall sick again if you don't stick to the diet.
This is the room
wherein my grandma poisoned three newborn girls
my mother had given birth to.
But she wasn't able to kill me.
That old hag got bedridden and died in this very room.
I don't know why,
but my mother always stopped me from entering this room.
She would say that death resides here.
Strange coincidence, right?
All the people who died in this room
were women.
And look…
you are destined to die here as well.
Madam…
I'm not at fault.
I haven't done anything wrong.
There's some misunderstanding, madam.
I already have poison running through my veins, thanks to you.
Now, before I sting you,
blurt out the truth.
I might spare your life.
Madam.
I…
My real name is Shazia Ahmed.
I was engaged to Danish.
But one day, out of the blue, he got married to you.
I was really hurt.
I was in love with Danish, madam.
However…
I thought I couldn't fight destiny. So, I decided to move on.
But one day, he came to meet me in New Delhi.
Listen to me.
I was trapped.
She is the Chief Minister.
What could I have done when she proposed in front of everyone?
I… I'm trying.
I was very angry with you.
Then he asked me to come to Lucknow.
I didn't know about his plan, madam.
He…
he kept asking me to do things and I followed his orders.
Write down the name of the poison that you were giving me.
Write it down.
Do it!
Who poisoned me first?
Was it you…
or Danish?
Danish.
Madam…
please forgive me.
I didn't do anything.
Whatever I did was to get him back.
I didn't have any vested interest, madam.
Please forgive me.
-Go ahead with your endeavors, Tara! -You have our support!
-Go ahead with your endeavors, Tara! -You have our support!
-Go ahead with your endeavors, Tara! -You have our support!
Mr. Khan?
When did you come back?
I was worried.
You didn't take my calls.
Where were you?
Shazia is dead, Mr. Khan.
I loved you.
I trusted you.
Why did you…
do this?
For the same reason…
you got…
Arvind Singh's MLAs abducted,
filed false charges against him,
and got Indramani Tripathi killed.
Power.
Masterji always wanted to keep his people…
away from the arrogance of power.
But he forgot…
that it's impossible to do so
while you're in power.
Neither could you escape it nor me.
The only difference is that you managed to win this game.
I wasn't fortunate.
I have been caught.
I know you won't spare me.
So, go ahead.
Shoot me.
You are my husband.
Witch, whore, mistress…
I have been called many such names.
I don't want to add another curse word to the list by killing you.
YET ANOTHER WIN FOR TARA'S GOVERNMENT
Today…
I won't ask you…
how I look.
Because today…
the woman standing before you…
is helpless,
forlorn,
and defeated!
And this woman wants to know
what she got in return
for serving all of you?
What was my fault?
Why did I get such a big punishment?
What wrong did I do?
Why was everything taken away from me?
Tell me!
Masterji, a man who was like a father to me, was murdered.
A CBI probe was initiated against me.
My only brother was shot dead.
And the man…
whom I had accepted…
as my husband in front of everyone…
Look at him.
Take a look at…
what my enemies have done to him.
This is my beloved husband.
He is the man you approved of!
He is the man who…
got married to me on this very stage.
Do you remember?
TARA
But I am stubborn!
I have always been a tough nut.
I will overcome the hurdles!
I will make sacrifices if I have to!
But I promise you that
nothing in the universe
can stop me from serving you!
I am married!
I am unfortunate!
But the fact is that…
I am still yours.
-She is a raging storm! -She's here to transform.
-She is a raging storm! -She's here to transform.
-She is a raging storm! -She's here to transform!
-All hail… -Tara's governance!
-All hail… -Tara's governance!
Daughter-in-law!
She is taking her!
Father!
Let go of me!
I will not leave until I seek revenge!
I will not leave!
Reet.
Let's go, my dear.
-Whose bag is it? -What?
Someone left it behind. Hey.
It's a bomb!
It doesn't belong to any of us.
I am telling you, there's a bomb in it.
Bomb!
Oh, God!
We can't even get out of here.
Don't worry, Grandma.
-I've got your back. -Back off!
-Move. -Hey!
This bag doesn't have a bomb in it.
-This bag belongs to a bombshell. -What?
What is he saying?
Cowards!
-What's happened to him? -Now watch me hug it.
-Hi. -Thank you so much.
Thank you so so much.
Oh, come on. You don't need to thank me, Reet.
How do you know my name?
Reet Rathore.
You are traveling to Chandigarh.
How do you know that?
I just know. I just know things.
You can call it sixth sense or… sixth sense.
No, I didn't read that.
-Sure. -I really do have a sixth sense.
By the way, I am Ruhaan Randhawa.
I am traveling to Delhi via Chandigarh.
Thank you. Thanks a lot.
Watch out, Auntie!
Reet!
Stalker much?
No, the phone--
Oh, so you want my phone number now!
-You are getting it all wrong. -No, I got it right.
You think you stand a chance because you helped me?
Reet, this phone--
To hell with your phone!
Are you a crackpot or what?
I am not a crackpot,
but your phone just cracked a "pop."
You left it back there.
What?!
Oh, shit!
Your family must be worried. Here, talk to your sister-in-law.
How do you know about her?
Here, talk to her.
Hey, Reet. Where have you reached?
I just took the bus.
Show some excitement, you are getting married.
Come on, sister-in-law!
Did you really just send me here to become a doctor
so that you could get me married to any stranger?
Reet, Sagar is a very nice boy.
Yes, and consider yourself lucky.
Oh, really? If he is so nice, why don't you marry him instead?
Okay. I will if you don't show up.
Come soon.
Everyone is waiting for you.
Bye.
You can get someone better than Sagar.
You still don't believe that I have a sixth sense?!
Here you go then.
You are from Rajasthan.
Your father's name is Thakur Vijender Singh.
You have been here for four years
studying MBBS at a medical college.
-Awesome. -I know, right?
You really do have a sixth sense.
That's amazing.
Can I also try?
You are Ruhaan Randhawa.
The only child of late business tycoon Ratan Randhawa.
You are from Delhi.
Education from The Doon School.
Currently unemployed.
Right?
You too have a Facebook account, you know?
This is where you got all that information from, right?
Here.
My relationship status is single on Facebook, you know?
The bus will stop here for 20 minutes.
I've been on the road ever since my parents died.
I went to Gujarat last month to fly a kite.
Before that, I went to Banaras to have a paan.
You are mad.
This is how one should live life, Reet.
Just pack your bags and go globe-trotting.
Live in the moment.
Tell me something, which is the place that you liked the most here?
I spent the last four years traveling back and forth between college and the hostel.
Why?
Well, my dad is quite strict.
He wasn't even ready to send me here.
He agreed only on the condition that all I'd do here is study.
That's why I kept traveling back and forth
between college and the hostel.
Even if you mind, can I say something?
Sure.
You are either too naive…
or you think I am that.
That?
The word that shall not be used.
It starts with a C.
Con man?
Never mind. You are naive.
Reet, now don't tell me
that you didn't even attend the famous music festival here.
You didn't?!
I am not mad, you are mad.
Come on.
You have to attend that festival with me.
Let's go!
The bus is leaving! Let's go! Hurry up!
-Let's go. -Come on!
Reet…
this isn't the only bus that goes to Chandigarh.
We will take the evening bus.
You'll have to wait at the airport for a couple of hours anyway.
Let's utilize that time here instead.
You have wasted four years.
I am sure you can spare four hours for yourself!
What do you say?
Geet!
Reet!
You take away all our sufferings
You are bountiful
Both, the rich and the poor Are your supplicants
We have mixed a Hindi poetry With English pop music
This song's got swag With a touch of devotion to it
My lonely heart pleads
When will I find the dream girl I seek?
Help me find what I seek
O the one who sets Everything right for her devotees
You have always been true to your words
Everyone, give a huge round Of applause for this girl
Everyone, give a huge round Of applause for this girl
Everyone, give a huge round Of applause for this girl
Everyone, give a huge round Of applause for this girl
Everyone, give a huge round Of applause for this girl
You have always been true to your words
Some want hot bombshells
Some want selfie queens
I just want something That grows gradually
I just want everlasting love
Someone with intoxicating eyes
Someone as beautiful as the moon
Introduce me to such a girl
O the one who changes Everyone's fate for good
You have always been true to your words
Everyone, give a huge round Of applause for this girl
Everyone, give a huge round Of applause for this girl
You have always been true to your words
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?
I have already lost my mind
Why are you making me Lose my good intentions?
Your lovers are rowdies, it's true
Don't assume that I am fake too
I do rap and not Qawali
You are always true to your words
Everyone, give a huge round Of applause for this girl
Everyone, give a huge round Of applause for this girl
You are always true to your words
She isn't answering the phone.
Please tell us, sir.
We will tell you everything we know.
You should go and talk to them.
What is going on, sir?
The 02:30 p.m. bus en route to Chandigarh met with an accident.
The bus fell down the gorge.
That's the bus we were supposed to be on.
Thank God you didn't take that bus.
None of the passengers on that bus survived.
Find it.
Hello?
Hello?
I can't hear you. Hello?
Hello, Trisha!
Trisha? I can hear you!
How did this happen, Sagar?
I used to pray to God every day that your marriage with Reet gets called off
so that we could be together.
I never thought that this is how God would answer my prayers.
Reet is gone because of me, Sagar.
It is not your fault.
Reet,
at least, now, your sister can marry…
your fiancé.
-She cannot. -Why not?
If I go home, Dad will make sure that I get married.
For real?
Wedding invites have already been sent.
Everyone in the city knows that I am supposed to get married to Sagar.
Changing the bride at the last minute will ruin our reputation.
And my father can tolerate anything but that.
He'll make sure that I get married to Sagar.
So, what will you do now?
I will have to hide the fact from my family that I am alive, Ruhaan.
Only then do they stand a chance to get married.
So, according to your family, you'll be dead forever?
No.
I can tell them the truth once they get married.
What about Hitler…
I mean, your father?
You think he'll forgive you once he learns the truth?
Perhaps not.
He might sever all ties with me.
But at least, my sister will be able to settle down with the one she loves.
You are such a nice person.
I wonder what my family must be going through after hearing about my death!
I cannot even go in front of them.
But you…
Ruhaan, will you come with me?
Death, funeral, crying, and wailing?
Why are you getting me into this mess?
Look, Ruhaan, you are not going back home anyway.
You plan to wander around.
So, why not go to Bhawanigarh with me!
Bhaw-- Bhawanigarh?
You can go to Gujarat to fly a kite, you can go to Banaras to have a paan,
but you cannot go to Rajasthan to help a girl?!
You know, our dal bati churma is quite famous.
Really?
I've never had it.
Oh my, such a romantic place!
This is your house?!
Where are you going?
Don't go inside, everyone will recognize you.
Stop! Someone will see you, Reet!
Reet!
This used to be my home.
This is where I spent my childhood.
No one comes here anymore.
This is the safest place to hide.
Come on.
Even if you mind, can I say something?
Sure.
It's quite spooky.
That it is.
Villagers think it is haunted.
Haunted?!
They say it is haunted by Manjulika's spirit.
She used to sing, "Oh, my beloved, listen."
Spirit?
Oh, look!
It's locked.
We can't go inside.
Let's leave. Come.
How did that happen?
It's old and rusty. It must have fallen off.
And this?
It's quite windy out here.
Winds must have opened it. Let's go.
It's windy?
You are scared.
Scared? Who, me?
-Clack bat! -What happened?
-A clack bat! -What?
A black cat!
Let's go.
Come on, Ruhaan!
You're a modern guy, how can you possibly believe in ghosts?
No.
I don't believe in them.
They aren't trustworthy at all.
Whenever they see someone alive,
they kill them.
Reet?
I think…
Mika is in the lounge.
Mika?
I mean Manjulika.
Oh my God, lights!
Villages are known for power cuts,
not sudden power surges.
Even in the unconscious
Only I remember you
What the--
Thakur Saab!
Thakur Saab!
Catastrophe!
Catastrophe!
A disaster!
A disaster!
Past has been unearthed!
Who had a birth?
She just died.
Priest, he said past has been unearthed.
What are you doing?
What happened, Chote Pandit?
The doors of the old manor were open, sir.
And the lights were turned on.
-What? -What?
How did it open?
I have spent some of the most beautiful moments of my life here.
You know-- Come here.
Dad used to push that swing for me.
Your dad is a swinger?
Father…
what if someone has opened that door as well?
And this is where my sister-in-law used to oil and massage my hair.
And my uncle and I used to gambol over there.
What if someone rented it out by mistake?
Anyway, we'll learn the truth soon enough.
You should have converted it into a library, Thakur Saab.
Rajjo, Potlu, Auntie, Trisha…
Ruhaan, how I wish we could all stay in this house once again!
If anyone sees me, we'll be in trouble.
Hide here!
Nice. It's well-maintained.
Who has maintained this manor?
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Thakur Saab, I have a more important question to ask.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Keep quiet, deaf guy.
I am Ruhaan, Uncle. I mean Thakur Saab.
I didn't come here on my own.
Reet brought me here.
Shit.
Reet?
Reet is dead.
Did her ghost bring you here?
Yes.
He is right.
Reet brought me here. I mean her ghost brought me here.
Look, Uncle, I mean Thakur Saab,
I too wouldn't believe in me if I were standing in your place.
But I am standing here, right?
I have a God's gift.
I can see dead people.
Oh, fish.
I am raised among ghosts. It's true.
In fact, instead of tring-tring, my house phone rings like conjuring-conjuring.
Conjuring-conjuring?
Yes.
What are you doing? Hey!
Why are you--
Who…
who is this sweet boy?
This mongoose-faced man is a devil in disguise, Uncle!
He is a liar!
Is he your son?
This is the right time to confess if you are lying.
Otherwise, irrespective of whether you can see ghosts or not,
no one on the face of the earth will be able to see you anymore.
Why would I lie?
That swing over there…
you used to push it for Reet, right?
And sister-in-law,
you used to oil Reet's hair.
And you are… her uncle.
Right.
You used to gambol with her when she was young.
Right?
Does any outsider know these things?
-No. -No, right?
How do I know about them?
Reet told me about them.
Reet's ghost told me about them.
Look…
Reet was our life.
I hope you are not playing with our feelings.
Sister-in-law,
I swear on my dead mother…
Reet is here.
Look, she is standing over there and looking at all of you with love.
Where?
No, not on your left,
on your right.
-Reet is here?! -Yes.
Why didn't Reet bring you home? Why did she bring you to this manor?
Right, brother?
Good question.
The answer…
What?
I see.
Oh… okay.
Can you see her?
I can't see her. Is she on our right or left?
Could you please dial it down a little?
Sorry.
Okay, I'll explain.
Reet is saying that she loved this house.
And her last wish is…
to stay in this house with her family.
If we manage to fulfill her last wish,
then that poor girl will get salvation.
But Father, what about Manjulika?
She is confined to that room.
If this is what Reet wishes for, then so be it.
Listen up, everyone!
Our whole family will stay here.
Get this place cleaned up.
Come with us.
I'll join you in a second, sister-in-law.
Hey, you two, don't just stand there staring at my face!
-Get lost! -Show some respect!
No, Uncle, I am not talking to you.
I am talking to the two spirits standing behind you.
Come on, off you go.
We'll discuss that at the new manor.
-Go. -No,
don't them to the new manor.
You should have your discussion right here.
-Are you sure? -See you tomorrow.
Sure?
As you wish.
Ruhaan, you've solved the whole problem.
If you can convince everyone to stay here,
then you can certainly convince them to get Sagar married to Trisha.
Perfect.
You have to forgive me, madam.
I am leaving.
-They will kill me if they see you here. -But--
No. Please… don't do this to me.
No one will see me here.
This manor has 15 corridors and 50 rooms.
I have many places to hide.
This manor is a labyrinth.
Labyrinth.
Labyrinth?
Hey, clean it properly!
-Hey, what are you doing? -This has to be done today!
Yes.
Work faster. Brother will be here any minute.
What is going on, Gulshan?
Why is it taking them so long to clean this floor?
-I'll get-- -I'll check upstairs.
I'll get this done. Work faster.
Look at the state of this place.
No one pays attention to it.
There are dried leaves on the floor.
No one cleans up--
No need to clean up this place!
You must be the first girl in the world to relish the food served at her funeral.
It's very tasty.
Ruhaan,
I don't want my family to be sad.
-If you-- -Okay.
So, you want me to go downstairs and put up another show?
-Please. -Truer words were never spoken,
a woman indeed doesn't leave you alone even after she dies.
Then ask him.
Thakur Saab…
she died at a very young age.
She was so young.
And she was unmarried.
Ma'am, you will have to offer her weight in silver as a donation.
For the magic.
Ma'am, how much did Reet weigh?
Around 45 kilos.
How much?
Forty-five kilos.
Oh, no. That poor girl was dieting.
Bade Pandit, if only it had been Thakur Saab instead of her…
we would have become rich.
He is healthy as a horse.
We were preparing for a wedding…
but we ended up having a funeral.
We will celebrate, sister-in-law.
We will have a wedding.
Trisha's wedding.
Trisha?
My first daughter just passed away.
How dare you talk about getting my second daughter married!
-Exactly! -Tell him!
Thakur Saab, this is Reet's last wish.
But wasn't her last wish to stay here?
That was her first last wish. This is her second last wish.
Tell me about it. She has a list of wishes.
Look, Reet wants you to carry on with the wedding as scheduled.
Get done with the henna ceremony and the engagement,
and have the wedding on the scheduled day.
The only difference…
will be that Trisha will be the bride,
instead of Reet.
This girl?!
-Get her married?! -What do you say, Trisha?
Would you like to fulfill your dead sister's last wish?
If this is what Reet wants.
Done.
What do you say, Sumit?
-Sagar. -Right. Sagar?
I mean,
I…
whatever--
If it's taking you so long to think, then maybe we should call it off.
-Yes, call it off. -No. I mean,
we should fulfill Reet's last wish.
This is the youth of our country.
How selfless!
This is wrong!
This is absolutely wrong.
Yes, Thakur Saab,
it is wrong.
But…
Reet? Why are you standing there? Come and sit over here.
Why do you always make her sit next to me?
Hang on a second. Kids shouldn't interrupt when adults are talking.
Okay.
But Thakur Saab--
I see.
Thakur Saab, Reet says that she wants to be happy with all of you.
She doesn't want you all to be sad.
Once she is happy,
she will take the shortcut to heaven.
There's a shortcut to heaven?!
It's a phrase, elephant--
An elephant never forgets.
It's a phrase.
You need to decide whether poor Reet gets to attend the wedding or not.
Trisha and Sagar will get married.
That's more like it, Thakur Saab.
One more thing,
her spirit is in peace after hearing all this.
-So, cancel the donation drive. -What!
Pack your stuff and leave.
-What! -Go.
Bade Pandit…
he's a bigger rascal than you.
Omniscient, my foot!
Tell you what…
he's a bigger rascal than us.
Hey, Ruhaan!
-Yes, Uncle? -Does Reet talk about me?
She always talks about you.
Really?
Yes.
-Look, there she is. -Where?
Right in front of you.
-She wants to swirl with you. -Really?
She has extended her hands. Come on, hold her hands.
-Okay. -A little to the right.
-Right. -Okay.
She is holding them.
-She is?! -She is holding them.
-Time to swirl. -She's holding my hands.
-Oh, yes! -Swirl. Yes, swirl.
-Are you having fun? -Yes.
Oh, Reet, my child, how are you?
Are you enjoying yourself?
-Ruhaan. -Yes?
Thank you so much, Ruhaan.
You know, I have been dieting for two months for the wedding.
I had even purchased an expensive dress for it.
I thought the dress would go to waste.
But another wedding will take place here, all thanks to Reet.
She is over here.
Reet!
I wish I could hug you.
You can.
How?
I don't just talk to spirits.
Spirits can possess my body as well.
Shit, why did I say that!
It was a secret.
Reet can be in two places at one time?!
Rajjo.
Reet?
Rajjo.
Come, give me a tight hug.
Reet?
You have never been so affectionate toward me.
It's not just you.
I am feeling affectionate toward all the females in the family.
I will meet everyone one by one.
Reet?
Reet?
Reet!
What is it, kiddo?
Reet, you remember her?
It's Granny.
She too wants to give you a tight hug.
Reet?
-Granny? -Yes.
Come, give me a hug.
You're going to join me in heaven in a couple of days anyway.
-Let's hug over there, okay? -No.
I am not going anywhere until I complete a century.
Come, give me a hug.
It feels good, doesn't it?
Someone liked getting cozy with Rajjo.
She is the only attractive thing in this haunted manor.
Let this poor guy have some fun.
Don't you feel ashamed of taking advantage of her emotions?
I do.
That's why I am thinking of making her my wife.
What?
Sister.
Sister?
My wife's sister.
Your sister, my wife's sister.
Ruhaan, I'll--
Hey!
Hide.
Welcome.
How come?
Ruhaan, there's something we need to tell Reet.
That you two love each other, right?
She knows. She is smart.
-She knows everything. -She knows?!
-Yes. -How does she know?
The call…
The phone call?
Shit.
I mean since yesterday.
You see, I am talking to a Bengali spirit,
so I've gained a Bengali accent.
Reet knows everything about you two since the time she died yesterday.
She says she is very happy for you two.
She says there is nothing more important for her than your happiness.
Okay, now, get out.
Thank you.
Welcome.
Ruhaan.
Ruhaan?
What are you doing here?
Here…
I don't know, sister-in-law.
Listen to me very carefully, Ruhaan.
Come what may,
you should never go anywhere close to this room.
You may have spoken to many spirits…
but Manjulika…
Manjulika is different, Ruhaan.
Let's go.
Triple role?
One, two, three?
Hey!
-What is it? -What is it?
I was enjoying a nice breakfast when I spotted you under it.
What?
Why is your picture in the newspaper?
What is this? What does this mean, obi--
They have published my picture because I can talk to spirits.
What about the others then?
Some of them are garlanded.
I had helped these spirits communicate with their family.
How nice! You are quite famous!
Who is he?
The village chief.
What does he want from me?
My mother wants to meet you.
-Why? -She wants to felicitate you.
They have kept a party in your honor.
Oh, there's a party?
-Let's go. -Let's go.
Let's go meet your mother, Chief.
How are you, Grandma?
What is wrong with her?
Cancer.
Oh.
Since when?
For the last 80 years.
Eighty?
What is her age?
She is around 80, son.
So, she had it since childhood?!
She's a fighter.
They should make a documentary on you, Grandma.
You know, they can cure cancer these days.
Grandma?
Hey, Grandma.
Priest, does she too have a weak connection like you?
No, her connection is broken.
There is no network.
What do you mean?
She just passed away.
Then--
Why did you call me here?
To talk to her spirit.
You are omniscient.
Talk to her.
She was very stingy, Mr. Ruhaan.
She hid all our ancestral gold and kicked the bucket.
We cannot talk to her dead body.
Call her spirit and ask where she has hidden the gold.
-I cannot do it just like that. -He is right.
He will need to cast spells and chant mantras, sir.
Let them communicate in private.
Pay your respect and leave.
Let bygones be bygones.
Take your time, son.
I am fasting to ensure we pull this off.
I have kept a monkey under that old hag's chair.
When the monkey laughs, Ruhaan will cry.
Grandma!
He found the gold!
He found the gold!
My gold! Good job, Mr. Ruhaan!
Wow! Give it to me!
I got my gold back.
He found the gold.
Congratulations.
It's a miracle!
He is not Ruhaan.
He is Rooh Baba.
Everyone, repeat after me.
-Hail Rooh Baba! -Hail Rooh Baba!
-Hail Rooh Baba! -Hail Rooh Baba!
-Hail Rooh Baba! -Hail Rooh Baba!
One selfie, please.
Say it loudly.
-Hail Rooh Baba! -Hail Rooh Baba!
Hail Rooh Baba!
These frivolous clothes don't suit you, Baba.
So, I want you to accept this garb as a gift from all the villagers.
Garb?
Costume.
-Hail Rooh Baba! -Hail Rooh Baba!
Don't think too hard. Just accept it as an offering and eat it.
Baba Rooh Baba!
Baba Rooh Baba!
Baba Rooh Baba!
Baba Rooh Baba!

Baba Rooh Baba!
Rooh Baba, please talk to our father's spirit and tell us.
Uncle?
Chitramal.
Neither of you will get the house.
The house will go to the animal welfare department.
Uncle Chitramal is saying that you two fight like dogs and cats.
So, it is better if the house is transferred over to the animals.
-No! -Don't say that, Rooh Baba!
-Yeah. -We are brothers.
-He's right. -We will share the house, Rooh Baba.
God bless you, Rooh Baba.
Baba Rooh Baba!

BADE PANDIT JAGANNATH SHASTRI WE HAVE ONLY ONE BRANCH
Write it down.
I spoke to Gandhiji just yesterday.
We are good friends.
Rooh Baba, you have helped everyone in the village,
but you are yet to communicate with my wife Kalawati.
Hey, go away!
Always following me for no reason!
I cannot help you communicate with Kalawati.
Because her soul has reincarnated.
What?
She is back?!
Where is she, Rooh Baba?
She is always following you.
She is standing right behind you.
Look.
This donkey is my wife?!
She was as dumb as a donkey
in her previous life as well to have married a dumbo like you.
Try to recognize her.
She is looking at you with so much affection.
Kallo?
She has the same eyes and lips.
She has to be Kallo.
Potlu?
Potlu?
They left.
No.
They left.

-Hail Rooh Baba! -Hail Rooh Baba!
WELCOME, ROOH BABA
Baba Rooh Baba
Good days will come, ma'am.
Good days will come.
In fact, good days are already here.
Ruhaan?
Did he run away?
Where is he?
Potlu…
She is alive!
-Reet is alive! -Shit!
There you go.
You lost your better half yet again.
You lost your queen.
I saw her!
Someone's all grown up now, Thakur Saab.
Shut up!
I saw Reet.
You must have seen someone else, Potlu.
No, she was there.
She is alive.
What?
Thakur Saab… Reet is alive.
Reet is alive?!
I mean children are a form of God and that has been proven today.
Children, dogs,
and puppies can see spirits.
I've heard about dogs being able to see them.
They have a clear conscience.
Are you a swine, Potlu?
What?
Are you sure, Potlu?
Yes.
Yes.
I so want to lift him.
But alas, he is quite heavy.
-Ruhaan? -Yes?
Does God really dwell in me?
Don't you believe me?
Come, let me prove it to you.
Come with me.
Look down.
Okay?
I am going to throw you down now, but nothing will happen to you.
You will bounce right back.
-No. -Listen, you little menace!
Do you know what I will do to you if you ever see Reet again?
What will you do?
I will lock you in that room.
There you will get to see your aunt.
Manjulika?
And what will she say?
"Oh, my beloved, listen."
I don't want to listen. I won't see Reet.
I didn't see her earlier either.
Calm down.
Relax.
Okay, come.
Come.
Come on.
What?
Here's your Manjulika.
You get scared for no reason.
Oh, yeah?
Everyone believes that there is a ghost in that room.
I am always worried about what will happen if anyone sees you.
When I step outside to clear my mind,
villagers drag me to the graveyard to talk to the dead.
I really feel like leaving this place for good.
Fine, you can leave.
I am really leaving, Reet.
Yes, I understand.
How long can we continue with this drama anyway!
I will have to come in front of everyone once Sagar and Trisha get married.
I understand.
Okay.
I will pack my bag and leave then.
-Are you sure I should leave? -I am sure.
It's a final goodbye.
Take care.
You are such a liar.
Your words don't match your thoughts.
It is not your fault.
Our relationship began with a lie.
What lie?
The lie that you are dead.
The lie that I can communicate with spirits.
Let's do one thing.
Let's tell each other some more lies before I leave.
What do you mean?
Give me your hand.
Not like this. Flip it over.
Now, repeat after me.
We solemnly swear…
We solemnly swear…
-…that whatever we say -that whatever we say
-will be a complete lie, -will be a complete lie,
-and nothing… -and nothing…
-but a lie. -but a lie.
I am not at all scared of Manjulika.
I too am sure that Manjulika's ghost exists.
I am starting to hate you.
I don't like you at all.
I don't want to spend another second with you.
I too want you to leave right now.
I have never seen a girl uglier than you in my life.
If you hate me so much, then just say it.
Fine…
I hate you.
I hate you too.
My behavior
Why has it changed ever since I met you?
I am surprised
Your presence
Why does it keep me awake all night?
I spend all night tossing and turning
It feels like we are walking on clouds
Why can't we walk on the ground anymore?
-Are we high on life? -Are we high on life?
-Are we high on life? -Are we high on life?
I didn't know
There would ever come A day I would fall in love
But that was before
I met you
I desire
Nothing much
All I want is all your free time
I am going crazy
My heart is feeling restless
Why can't I resolve this problem?
-Are we high on life? -Are we high on life?
-Are we high on life? -Are we high on life?
Rajasthan is famous for three things.
-Yeah. -Deserts,
camels, and now, Rooh Baba.
You know your black Rooh Baba garb?
-Yes. -Looks too good on you.
Come on, Uncle.
That is the only black thing that is good.
All the other black things are associated with bad things.
Black magic.
-Black magic? -Yes.
That's what Manjulika used to do.
That…
I've been hearing about Manjulika ever since I got here.
-Who is she? -Here.
-Where? -Right here.
She's trapped right here.
Careful there, Uncle.
Be careful.
She has taken over the entire third floor.
-She has made the property rates fall-- -Careful, Uncle,
or you'll fall right into her lap.
No, I don't need to fear when I have you next to me.
You can talk to spirits.
You should ask her what she wants.
What do you want?
-Let's go and ask her. -Let's go.
-Coming to get you, Manju! -Let's go.
Watch your step.
I will put an end to Manjulika's story today.
-Just tell me… -What?
if I should go inside and bash her up or bring her out.
Bring her out, son. Bring her out.
It will make me happy.
I will give her a tight slap.
Who started the cooler?
Let's shut it down.
It shut down.
Who is it?
Ruhaan!
What are you doing?
Sorry, Thakur… Saab.
Have you two lost your mind?
I'd told you not to come here.
Sorry.
The spirit behind this door is no ordinary spirit, Ruhaan.
It's Manjulika who can do black magic.
Manjulika.
Many years ago…
my father was called here from Kolkata
to manage the accounts.
My twin sister, Manjulika, and I came with him.
I am yours
I am solely yours
Oh, my beloved, listen
My desires will Forever remain in the breeze
My father was a maestro of dance and music.
Very good. It's a miracle.
Manju would feel jealous
whenever Dad showed affection toward me or praised me.
I didn't realize when her jealously turned into hatred.
Let there be eternal peace.
Manjulika?
Manjulika!
What have you been doing here?
What are you doing?
You are driving me mad!
It will ruin everything!
We looked the same…
but had completely opposite personalities.
Dad thought she would eventually fall back in line.
What we didn't know
was that Manjulika's insanity was growing with passing time.
She preferred a different world.
She was interested in black magic, dark spells,
and the dark world of the Aghoris.
Manju loved Kunwar very much.
She had started loving him.
-Sorry. -I am so sorry.
Beloved, even after death
I will love you
In restlessness
My heart will seek you
Your voice plays in my heart
Your desires can be seen in my heart
Your voice can be heard in The clinking of my bangles
This separation always brings us closer
-Oh, my beloved! -Oh, my beloved!
-I am yours -I am yours
-I am solely yours -I am solely yours
-I am yours -I am yours
My son, Kunwar, likes your daughter.
If you don't mind, I would like her to be my daughter-in-law.
Thank you very much.
It will be a privilege.
What are you doing?
We are related now.
Manjulika!
What are you doing?
I'd told you to stop all this.
You want to use black magic to kill your sister?
Why didn't you die before thinking about killing her!
You should have never been born!
I wish God had given me just one daughter.
I will not spare you.
I will not spare you!
It's a good thing that Anjulika doesn't do black magic.
Otherwise, you would have said, "Anjulika is so good at doing black magic.
Manjulika, you should learn something from her."
You always scolded me.
You never loved me. Why?
But I love you a lot, Dad.
I love you so much.
And I will do as you say.
You wished that you had just one daughter, right?
Now onward, you will have just one daughter.
I promise.
Manjulika!
Manjulika, what are you doing?
Manjulika, you--
Manjulika! What are you doing?
Manjulika!
Manjulika, stop it!
Anju.
I killed my sister.
I killed her.
But death didn't stop Manjulika.
We called an exorcist before Manjulika's spirit could hurt anyone else.
Manjulika is enduring the punishment
for her sins in that room.
Call it our bad luck or Manjulika's curse,
but we have lost eight family members since then.
Uncle…
did you get them drunk and take them to that room?
Keep quiet.
Ruhaan,
would you still like to meet Manjulika?
No, sister-in-law. I am not interested in talking to such a disgusting woman.
Not interested.
I got to step out after so many days.
Such a relief!
I even made you try the famous dal bati churma.
Now, do you finally believe that Manjulika doesn't exist?
Can we talk about something other than ghosts for a change?
-Let's go. Let's get out of here. -Let's go.
Next time, we will ride a camel, okay?
Reet is alive.
He is not Rooh Baba, he is Liar Baba!
She is not Kalawati. She is a donkey.
I am such an idiot.
I'd come to ask him if Nathu's dog
is my deceased mother as she always tries to bite me.
I won't spare you, Rooh Baba.
I'll go and inform the idiot…
I mean Bade Pandit!
Bade Pandit!
-Our time will come! -Our time will come!
-Our time will come! -Our time will come!
-Our time will come! -Our time will come!
Thakur Saab!
Thakur Saab!
-Thakur Saab! Thakur Sa-- -He's over here.
What is it, priest?
-What's all this commotion about? -Score?
Bangladesh won the hockey match.
They won by 5-6.
He is asking me for the score.
Shut up, deaf guy.
-We have news for you. -Breaking news.
What is the news?
He is not a sage.
I have checked his horoscope.
-He is lying. -Right.
Thakur Saab, your daughter, Reet, is alive.
I swear on Goddess Bhawani!
Then, who was playing with me before?
I saw her.
You can break my legs if I am lying.
And if he is telling the truth, then Ruhaan gets the same punishment.
-Break his legs. -Right.
Priest, if you are telling the truth, then I won't break his legs…
I will behead him.
Promise?
He promised.
Father…
how can you doubt Ruhaan?
He has nothing to fear if he hasn't done anything wrong.
Let them assure themselves.
Search each and every room in the manor.
Sure, you can frisk me.
-Search the manor. -Search the manor.
-Okay. -Search every courtyard and corridor!
-We will! -We will!
Search every nook and corner!
-We will! -We will!
Look for her everywhere!
-We will! -We will!
We will find her!
-We will! -We will!
Find her, my beloved…
-My beloved. -My beloved.
Find her, my beloved…
-My beloved. -My beloved.
Reet, run!
Ruhaan!
Calm down. It's okay.
-No, let's go this way. -Let's go.
Search there!
Did you find her?
-Not yet. -Not yet.
Did you find her?
-Not yet. -Not yet.
Today, we will find her anyhow.
Let's go.
Check upstairs!
Let's go.
Thakur Saab.
Look over there!
There isn't anyone down here.
Search upstairs.
Don't worry, we will find her.
Listen up, everybody.
Let's go upstairs.
You have nothing to fear as long as I am with you.
Follow me!
We will find her.
What is this?
May Lord save us from evil!
You don't need to fear anyone. Follow me. Let's go upstairs.
Look for her over there!
Check every nook and corner!
Today, Ruhaan will be beheaded!
Listen up, everyone!
-Search upstairs. -Ruhaan.
-Go, look up. -Let's go.
Now, there is just one way to escape them.
-What? -No one will search this room.
Don't worry.
What about Manjulika?
She is just a myth.
Just like our story, her story is also a lie.
-Let's go. We have no other option. -No, Reet. Reet.
-Don't-- -Check upstairs as well!
-Open the door, Ruhaan. -Ruhaan will be beheaded today.
Hurry up.
We searched the entire manor, Thakur Saab.
The three of us went right, and the others went left.
On the left, we saw--
Enough of these complex equations, priest!
Did you find Reet?
Excrete?
You seem to be a little wet behind the ears.
Under these circumstances, just dump it out!
So, you should ask, "Did you find her?"
You will get us killed. Just shut up and stand here.
Priest!
Where's Chote Pandit?
He ran away.
Tell me, did you find Reet?
I am deaf.
-He is talking to you. -I--
Thakur Saab,
we searched the entire manor,
except for Manjulika's room.
I think…
Reet is hiding there.
Thakur Saab is smart.
Do you also think that?
Do you really think anyone would make the mistake of opening that room?
Forgive us for doubting you, Ruhaan.
It's okay, sister-in-law.
Thakur Saab,
weren't you talking about beheading someone,
chopping off someone's legs, or something?
-He was talking about it. -Yeah, wasn't he?
-Yes. -How does he plan to do it?
Using a saw.
So, where's the saw?
At home.
Go, get it.
-Okay. -Go, get it.
Stop, you fool!
We already have a dagger and a sword here.
But women these days always want more.
You are lucky to be that, Thakur Saab!
Let's go.
Move!
I should have gone to Bigg Boss instead,
where you, at least, get paid for being humiliated.
Yes. Bless us, God.
Reet.
Reet.
I am yours
I am solely yours
I am yours
My desires will forever remain
In the breeze
It will stay alive
Even after being destroyed
I am yours
I am solely yours
I am yours
I am Manjulika!
It is not my fault, Ms. Manju. Please, forgive me.
I came to this room by mistake, sister. It is not my fault.
Please forgive me. Please.
I told you there is no ghost here.
Manjulika doesn't exist.
There is a limit to joking around.
Oh, come on.
I am sorry. Sorry.
You are crazy.
These clothes were lying there, so I thought I should play a prank on you.
Prank?
I don't understand your pranks.
By the way, you look quite cute when you are scared.
Wash your face.
You look just as scary as Manjulika.
There is no one out there. Let's go.
The boy goes jumping to the fair
But returns with A punctured tire of his cycle
Ruhaan!
Ruhaan!
Is Reet upset over something?
-No. -She is breaking things around the house.
-She's breaking things?! -Yes.
-Hey! -What just happened?
She is here now.
Manjulika.
What was that?
Reet?
What are you doing, Reet?
Are you crazy?
Put those things down.
Reet!
Why are you disrupting the celebrations?
Stop this nonsense!
Thakur Saab, at least, don't scold ghosts.
I know what is wrong.
What is wrong?
We doubted you two yesterday.
That's why Reet is upset.
That's why. Right.
-That's-- -For such a small thing?
Reet, my child, forgive us. We are sorry.
Come on, let's hold hands and swirl.
You will feel better.
Don't worry.
I will cajole her in no time.
Slow down, dear.
Don't go so fast, Reet! Slow down!
Reet, I said slow down! Reet!
-Uncle? -That hurts.
Are you alright?
Who plays like that?
It seems like she is quite angry.
Ask Reet not to be so upset over this.
I am doing that, Granny.
Reet…
please don't be so upset.
Please calm down.
Stop it, will you?
-Manjulika! -Manjulika?!
I mean, according to what I have read about ghosts, this has to be Reet.
If that is Reet, then how can we see her?
That's because your heart too is clean just like his.
-Reet! -What is it?
Look at your granny.
-Reet… -Yes, everyone can see her.
That's Reet. Everyone can see her.
Doesn't it look like she's gained some weight?
Who would bother maintaining their weight after dying!
That is true.
Hey, where did she go?
Where did she disappear?
She got upset because we called her fat.
She was already in a bad mood.
I'll go cajole her.
Reet!
Get out of my way! The show's over!
Reet!
Reet?
Reet.
Reet!
Did Manjulika take her away?
Ruhaan.
Forget Manjulika, I feel like you will kill me first.
Where is my bag?
Why do you start packing your bags over trivial matters?
Let's run away.
Ruhaan… we're Thakurs.
We never run away from trouble.
And we're Randhawas. We flee at the first sign of trouble.
We cannot leave.
We set Manjulika free.
Everyone's life is in danger because of us.
And you know what the worst part is?
No one knows that she has been set free.
Okay, fine, you can leave if you want to.
I am not leaving.
Why did I have to fall for a Thakur?
I should have fallen for a Gupta or an Agarwal's daughter instead.
This--
Free.
My mother was right.
Wives do start looking like witches after a couple of years.
You do look like one.
Really?
In the flesh.
You do have something witchy about you.
She is indeed a witch.
But look, Ruhaan managed to turn my witchy wife into a donkey.
Don't stand there in your birthday suit, daughter-in-law.
-Go inside! -I am not your husband.
Go away.
-Leave! -Leave that donkey alone.
We have finally managed to fool Ruhaan.
Didn't you see how scared he was?
He is dying of cold?!
He was scared!
We have to scare him.
We need to confirm whether Reet is alive or Ruhaan is simply lying.
Mind-blowing.
Amazing.
No, priest,
you are amazing.
I just walked backward.
You are the one who made things fly.
Like a Hollywood hero!
I made things fly?
-He did? -Yes.
I thought you were behind that amazing feat.
-Why would Mohanlal be here? -He said amazing feat.
Which police?
Amazing!
What's amazing is that Ruhaan thinks Manjulika has been set free.
You got it all wrong.
Ruhaan thinks Manjulika has been set free.
Priest, it's time for some cow urine.
-Let's go. -Yes.
-Yes. -She thinks he made things fly.
He cannot fly a thing.
I didn't make anything fly.
Then, who made those things fly?
Is Manjulika really back?
Sister-in-law?
What happened?
Where is Reet?
Reet?
There she is. She's sitting on the sofa there, look.
I know that Reet is alive.
The priest was telling the truth.
You were hiding Reet in Manjulika's room.
Where is she?
He was lying, sister-in-law.
Both, Chote Pandit and Bade Pandit, keep spinning tales.
Don't believe them.
Reet isn't here.
Sister-in-law.
Reet?
Reet!
What is going on, Reet?
Why did you lie?
I'll tell you everything.
Then, all of you thought that he could talk to spirits.
What else could I do, sister-in-law?
I had to do this for Trisha.
You know what happened because of that, don't you?
Manjulika has been set free.
She attacked me!
For 18 years,
I kept thinking…
of ways to kill you…
once I get out of there.
But not so easily.
Not so easily.
Kunwar,
you too have been trapped in that body for 18 years.
Come…
let me set you free.
My dearest sister Anjulika,
Kunwar is showing some movement after all these years.
Aren't you happy?
Alright.
I will leave him for now.
I will kill all your family members one by one.
You will suffer.
You will cry.
But you won't be able to save anyone.
And in the end,
you will meet your end.
What should we do now?
Disaster!
This is an irremediable disaster!
She has been trapped in that room for 18 years.
You have no idea how angry and vindictive she must be feeling.
That banshee must have become even more powerful now.
It won't be easy…
to recapture her.
There has to be a solution, Baba.
Spirits are at their weakest during a lunar eclipse.
We can recapture her when that happens.
Why do all banshees have to be connected to lunar eclipses?
Baba, he means, when is the next lunar eclipse?
After three days.
Three days?
Couldn't you wait for three days to enter Manjulika's room?
We would have sent her back right away.
I am not worried about myself, Baba.
-But my family-- -That's enough!
I will keep chanting protective mantras nonstop for three days.
She won't be able to go anywhere near you or your family.
She won't be able to do anything.
Anything at all!
Potlu! Is someone coming?
Go faster, Reet!
This is fun!
Reet, I too want to fly like him.
Is your sage fake like the other sages?
He was making tall claims.
He said Manjulika won't be able to come anywhere close to us.
But here, she is playing with the kid!
She isn't playing with him, she is playing with our fears.
-Uncle. -What?
Come here.
Ruhaan, we no longer need you for intermediation.
Reet starts playing with us on her own now. Look over there.
That is not Reet, Uncle.
Then who is it?
Manjulika.
-Manjulika? -Yes.
Brother!
-Manjulika has been set free! -Hey, stop!
Manjulika?!
He is drunk.
He is just kidding.
-You want to go tell him everything? -Yes.
What will you tell him?
That she came out because of you?
Because of me? What do you mean?
Of course, because of you.
Who got drunk and told me to open the door?
Who asked me to remove the trident?
I did…
-but now, she'd better not hurt my child! -Drunkard!
Go easy, Dad. Manjulika can hear you.
Oh, can she? Good for her. Let her hear me.
I haven't said anything wrong.
Ms. Manjulika, please don't hurt Potlu.
Aunt Manjulika, kids should not spend all their time playing.
I still have a lot of homework to do.
I don't want to fail school.
Please put me down.
Good.
Come down. Come down, my boy.
She let him go. Thank you.
She let him go.
She must be tired of holding him up.
Potlu?
It was just a dream. Thank God.
What the--
Sister-in-law, what are you doing here?
Uncle is missing, Ruhaan. We can't find him.
Did Manjulika…
I wonder where he is!
I think we will have to inform brother about it.
Mom, I think Dad was taken by Manju--
Manju. Right. Uncle was talking to a girl called Manju.
I heard them.
-They were planning a rendezvous. -What?
I am so worried about him, and he is busy being a spoiled man-about-town.
He can go to hell for all I care.
-No, Mom. He-- -Where are you going?
Look for him over there, sister-in-law.
I'll take care of him. Come on.
Did Manjulika adopt a dog?
I guess, but her dog doesn't bite.
Why are you making me take the lead?
Because he is your father.
You will have to be the one to make the sacrifice.
Dad!
Dad!
What is wrong?
Why are you snoring like that?
Uncle, why are you sleeping on Manjulika's bed?
She will possess you.
This is the last place Manjulika would want to be.
Why?
She spent 18 years trapped in here, stupid.
-Eighteen years. -So?
So, a prisoner will never want to go back to his prison cell.
Uncle, sister-in-law has already made a plan with the exorcist.
You have no reason to fear.
She has never done anything right. I don't trust her plans.
I am not getting out of here.
Come on, Uncle.
Do as you please. I am leaving.
You're leaving your father all alone?
What…
what was that?
Hurry up and leave from here.
What have I done!
-Rooh Baba. -Yes?
You talk to spirits so easily,
but it is so difficult to convince you to talk to them.
-Hail Rooh Baba. -Namaste, Baba.
-Yeah, whatever! -Rooh Baba.
Stop it.
We cannot get rid of our problem, but you mother--
-What? -Your mother's spirit.
You've brought me here to communicate with your mother's spirit, right?
-Yes, Rooh Baba. -Wait, I will.
Look…
your mother is relaxing on that tree.
-Okay? -Yeah.
I'll go talk to her.
Auntie!
After you passed away,
your husband started drinking every day.
You should ask him to let go of his drinking habit.
Don't let go.
Hold on tight.
Remember, if I fall, you'll be dead.
You are a ghost.
You can walk on any surface.
That's what I am doing.
Do you know how difficult this is?
You have gained weight.
You should take keto.
Keep going.
Sister-in-law, pretend to be Manjulika and scare Ruhaan,
so that he is forced to tell the truth.
Damn you! You broke my back!
You need to seek revenge from Ruhaan, not me.
Behind you.
What? I too fell with you.
Look behind you, deaf guy.
Look behind you.
Oh, God.
He's behind me.
Yes.
Rascals! You three have been scaring everyone
by pretending to be Manjulika?
No.
It was them. I was just a helping hand.
Priest.
He is talking to you.
Greetings, priest.
Let's skip the formalities and get straight to the point.
-May I? -Please.
-Acting! -He's hitting my husband!
He's hitting a priest!
He is doomed to go to hell.
You will get cursed for hitting my husband!
You will never get married!
-You will never have an heir! -Stand straight.
I'm going to kick you.
Your spirit will keep wandering around!
-All the-- -Shut up.
I get possessed by Goddess!
Stop!
What are you doing?
Why you--
Please help!
You are not real.
You are just a figment of my imagination.
-Oh, Lord. -Imagine.
-No one is good. -Your wife is crying.
-Because her husband was thrashed. -Yeah.
Go, get her. Tell her she needs to go home.
Okay.
She had left food on the stove.
Yes. We were served burnt food yesterday as well.
She also needs to make rotis.
Oh, my!
Oh, no!
Let's go home, sister-in-law.
You need to check on the food you'd kept on the stove.
Can you please make some curry for me tomorrow?
My head is spinning--
Oh, God!
What happened?
Your sister-in-law refused to come with you, didn't she?
She is not my sister-in-law.
Don't you have house keys?
She is not my sister-in-law.
What did you say to your brother-in-law?
It's quite common for people like us to get thrashed like that.
Hey, Lajjo.
Do not tell your family that I got thrashed.
Everyone gets a beating at least once in their lifetime,
it's just that no one reveals it.
Anyway…
don't get upset over it.
Go, make some curry.
Have you consumed cannabis, Lajjo?
A camel somewhere wants water.
Last night was quite eventful, sister.
He was out of control.
Meenu's mother is pregnant again?!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
She is a doctor, bonehead!
She is a bloody doctor!
-She is a doctor! -Hey, priest!
Watch out. Have you turned blind too? Come this way.
Where to?
Over there.
What's over there?
Ma…
Manjulika?
Gho…
-A ghost? -Yes.
Hey, you two!
-Yeah. -Who could be scarier than you guys!
-She is! -She is!
Oh!
Actually, it is my fault.
-I thrashed you two but not her. -Yeah.
Come on, let's go and thrash her as well.
-No! -Come with me.
-No! -Come on!
No…
Fine, I'll go bash her up then.
Let's go, hurry up. Let's run away from the village.
Hey!
Hello!
Hi.
Even if you mind, can I ask you something?
Why do you hide your face?
What have you done that you need to hide your face?
Actually, you are full of cliches.
Black clothes, white face, and hair covering the face.
Manjulika.
How can you be Manjulika?
Donald Trump's tweets and a witch's feet are always crooked.
Oh, damn.
Oh, God!
Did someone fall somewhere? I think I heard something.
-Greetings, sister-in-law. -Greetings.
Why does Mr. Kunwar always sit like that?
Because Manjulika paid him a visit.
Oh, God!
Greetings, Thakur Saab.
Oh, wow! There's the picture-perfect family!
Greetings, priest. What brings you here?
We are here because we are leaving.
What do you mean?
-Well-- -We are leaving this village.
What happened?
Looks like they don't know that Manjulika has been set free.
They will get to know when she comes and slaps them.
Why should we bother telling them?
Stop whispering to each other. Let's just get to the point.
Thakur Saab, you owe us some money for the ritual we had performed.
-What? -Yes.
You owe us 64 rupees.
You came here for 64 rupees?!
Yes, please.
-Give it to me. -Here.
The old hag gave me exactly 64 rupees.
Everyone, go get some rest. We have a wedding to attend tomorrow.
-Right, we too will get going now. -We too will get going now.
-Good night. -Good night.
Love is such a rare commodity these days.
-Brother! Hey! -Brother.
-Come on-- -Hey!
Hey!
They are made of brass. Should we steal them?
No. Why would we steal brass articles?
-Can't you see those silver utensils? -Yes.
We could've stolen a few more things if you had brought a bigger bag.
We've kept a sack out there. Let's get that.
Forget the sack and get one of the many trunks instead.
-Right. Quickly, go get one. -Let's go.
-Oh, God! -What was that!
Oh, no!
-What is going on? -Oh, Lord!
Another power cut?
-Will it be safe to step out now? -What if we bump into her once again?
Right.
Right.
-They are making an announcement. -…is eight hours late.
Our train is eight hours late.
Oh, God.
-We will leave at dawn. -Yeah.
Let's sleep on the sofa.
-Excuse me? Can we have a lamp, please? -Let's go.
We were just stealing a few things. It would be convenient.
I am yours
I am solely yours
I am yours
I am yours
I am solely yours
I am yours
My desires
Will forever remain in the breeze
It will stay alive
Even after being destroyed
Your tunes are immersed
In my breath
My life is nothing
Without you
Your tunes are immersed
In my breath
My life is nothing
Without you
Your voice plays in my heart
Your desires can be seen in my heart
You are the only thing I ever think about
The moment of separation Is very difficult
Oh, my beloved!
Ruhaan?
Ruhaan?
Ruhaan!
Yes, sister-in-law?
Why were you singing that song?
I just felt like singing it.
I love this song.
You know Bengali?
Very little.
-Ruhaan. -Yes?
Are you alright?
Absolutely fine.
-How about you? -Me?
Ruhaan…
it's quite late. You should go to bed.
Okay.
Good night.
Okay?
Ruhaan!
What is wrong?
You guys are strange.
Why have you decorated the house with flowers?
There is a wedding tomorrow.
A wedding?
How can there be a wedding tomorrow…
if someone is going to die here today?
What?!
Yes.
She is going to die.
I will kill her.
Ruhaan!
Didn't you tell everyone…
that I have been set free?
What is this nonsense?
Have you lost your mind?
You won't be spared this time!
I will not spare you!
I am Manjulika!
Manjulika!
She is back!
-She is back! -Run!
Hey, stop! Open the door!
Oh, God!
She is back!
What are you staring at with your eyes wide open?
Manjulika, my child, my Bengali is just as good as my French.
So, if you could translate that…
I want your blood!
He is talking to you.
Sister, I have a vitamin deficiency.
Both of them suffer from diabetes.
Full diabetes.
Total useless.
Uncle is as fit as a fiddle.
Uncle is trying to escape.
Reet.
Reet!
Brother!
Reet is here!
She is here to save us!
Hey, Manjulika!
Yes. Actually, no.
Only Manjulika.
Look who is here to fight you!
If you are a ghost, then we too have a ghost of our own.
Uncle, please hear me out.
We don't have time for that, dear.
Now, actions must speak louder than words.
-Reet, quickly take over my body. -Uncle?
Possess my body.
-Uncle? -She made Potlu fly.
-I'll make her fly. -Uncle! I am alive!
I am alive.
Since when?
From the beginning.
Ms. Manjulika?
Look at the kids of this generation! Just look at them!
They make mistakes,
and elders have to bear the consequences of their mistakes.
It's not fair!
No! Don't, Ms. Manju!
Oh, God!
After so many years, my time has finally come.
There was anger in my heart.
There was a fire.
Now is the time.
I've waited for so long.
Now is the time for revenge.
Now is the time.
Now,
everywhere, there will only be blood.
This fire will be doused.
Father…
we need to get the exorcist here at any cost.
Only he can save us now.
Hey. Tell me if I can be of any help to you.
I am no stranger to you.
You want to get the exorcist here?
Baba!
Where are you, Baba?
Is he dead?
He is gone.
Sorry.
Your savior is dead.
Now what?
Sister-in-law!
Sister-in-law!
Ruhaan!
Ruhaan--
Ruhaan! Please, Ruhaan!
She is my sister-in-law!
Ruhaan, I know that you can hear me.
Ruhaan, control yourself!
You can defeat Manjulika.
Please fight her!
Fight her, damn it!
Please, Ruhaan. Please, don't.
Ruhaan, please.
Ruhaan!
Take another step, Anjulika,
and I'll slit Reet's throat!
Anjulika…
or Manjulika?
Leave if you wish to live.
And take Reet with you.
Leave!
Why did you save me?
Why did you save me?
Sister-in-law.
Thakur Saab…
she is not Anjulika. She is Manjulika.
Your daughter-in-law has been dead for 18 years now.
Manjulika!
Manjulika! What are you doing?
Manjulika!
Manjulika!
Manjulika, stop it!
Brother had found out the truth,
but before he could tell anyone else…
Manjulika?
Yes?
Sister-in-law, why didn't you do anything after being set free?
Kill me.
Come on, kill me.
But what will you tell everyone?
That the one who has been showering them with her love for 18 years,
the one who has taken such good care of them is Manjulika?
And you, the one who cruelly killed me, is Anjulika?
Who will believe you?
They will hate you even more.
No one will ever learn the truth, Anju.
You'll get your revenge if you kill me…
but you won't get your family back.
Go away. Let me sleep.
Bloody devil!
Ruined all my efforts!
Hey, gimpy!
Why did you choose her over me?
We had the same face.
Everything was the same.
Then why?
Destiny.
She was very lucky.
That's why I stole…
her destiny from her.
I spent so many years as Anjulika.
Anjulika!
While she…
haunted this house.
No one even realized it.
Oh, no!
What am I saying?
No, some people did realize it.
So…
I sent them…
to heaven.
Oh, no.
I am bleeding.
Father, please don't be upset with Reet.
The truth wouldn't have come out if she hadn't lied.
Sorry, Dad.
Ruhaan?
You understood my pain when no one else could.
Thanks to you, I got a chance to meet my family today.
Thank you.
Sister-in-law, you don't need to thank me.
I am Rooh Baba.
It is my job to help spirits communicate with their family.
You know that, don't you?
Open the door!
Get me out of here!
I said get me out of here!
All of you should leave now.
The conversation between us sisters is incomplete.
Yes. Let's leave.
No!

Sofia!
What the fuck are you doing?
Mom, you swore!
-Idiot! -Ouch!
I'll get my revenge.
Come on, hon, sit properly.
What's up?
Nothing. You've been working since we left.
You haven't looked out once.
I'd get lost in these fields as a boy.
I've never seen a photo of you as a boy.
Don't tell my mother.
She'll bring out those from infancy to the conservatory.
I want to see them all.
No. Don't joke.
She'll make me play all my old scores. She still has them, conserved like relics.
She's very old-school.
She'll like you.
Maybe you should have told her first.
No.
A surprise!
Hey!
Hello!
-What's his name? -Tito.
Hi, Tito.
-Does he bite? -No, but he really stinks. Watch!
Tito!
Come here!
I didn't think it was so big.
She should move to the village, instead of being here alone.
Teresa's not alone.
Hi, Sabrina!
This is Emma.
Emma, it's a pleasure. And this is Sofia.
-Welcome. -Thank you.
You need a hand?
No, I can still manage this!
-I'll take mine! -OK.
-This way. -Let's go.
-How are you? -Tired, but it was a good trip.
-That's beautiful! -See?
Don't touch! Sofia!
I prepared the rooms upstairs.
Thank you, Sabrina.
That's me.
-Glad you've lost the mustache! -I like you like that!
Is that your mom?
Yes, a few years ago.
-Where is she? -She'll be here in a moment.
If you need me, I'll be in the kitchen.
Thank you.
Come on, this way.
Come on. We'll look at them later.
Sofia?
Come on.
It is too heavy?
No, no.
I'm sleeping here and you're there.
It's traditional. We're not married, we can't sleep together.
-Are you serious? -Yes, it's serious, it's really...
But I want to sleep on my own!
You can't. Unfortunately, that's how it is.
We're not married, we can't sleep together.
Sofia?
Mom, look.
What are they doing?
I don't know, hon.
But it's none of our business.
Here you are!
Mom!
Let's go.
Who's this girl?
Sofia.
-Hello, Sofia. You settled in? -Yeah, upstairs.
This is Emma.
Sorry for the welcome, I had things to deal with.
It really is a pleasure to meet you, Teresa.
My son finally managed to bring you here. It must be for a very important reason.
My son finally managed to bring you here. It must be for a very important reason. Right, Sofia?
You have the most beautiful eyes.
This place is magnificent.
Thank you. It's everything I have.
It took so many sacrifices.
You must have a lot to do.
-Speaking of which, how's it going? -You know, it's complicated.
Why don't you get someone to help?
We've always managed on our own. We'll manage this time as well.
-Let's go for a walk! -All right.
Don't go too far away. It's easy to get lost here.
I'll finish in the kitchen before the guests arrive.
Who have you invited?
The usual crowd. They wanted to see you after all this time.
Mom.
Wait, I'll come with you. I need to tell you something. See you later.
Come on, Mom, let's go.
What was that?
An old prayer from these parts.
It's recited to protect the family and those who're about to join it.
My son's getting married.
Congratulations!
Thank you.
In that case, let's have a toast!
-Cheers! -Cheers!
Was your daughter born in Italy?
No, I moved here when she was a year old.
-And what do you do? -Real estate, villas.
So you work in Milan, Rome...?
No, abroad mostly.
-What about the girl? -If it's a long trip, she comes with us.
Doesn't it bother you being away from home?
I'm used to it now.
Is she used to it as well? A child needs stability, no?
-You finished with the third degree? -Will it be a church or civil wedding?
Have you chosen a date?
It's beautiful. We could get married here.
-Seriously? -Yeah, let's have it here!
Sorry, Mom, I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.
Don't worry.
Hey.
I can't get it out.
Let's see.
Everything OK?
I'd never seen you pray before.
My mother cares about these things. She even invited the priest!
Come here!
Come here, Tito! Here!
Look!
You want it? Fetch!
Tito?
Tito? Wait!
Tito!
Tito, wait!
Tito!
What are you up to?
Tito ran away!
-Mom, this tree is so big! -It's over a thousand years old.
Why have those other trees been dug up?
Because they're sick.
I'll tell you a secret. My mother knows how to heal them.
Really?
Like a sort of magic?
Exactly.
Magic.
But don't tell anyone.
-He's good with Sofia. -She adores him.
At times I get a bit jealous.
You're lucky to have found a father for her.
Sofia already has a father.
Of course, I'm sorry.
Why did you get divorced?
We were too young. When Sofia was born, it was already over between us.
-But we stayed friends. -It can't be easy with your job.
A lot of people would pay to be in my place.
And Francesco loves traveling.
He's always been like that.
Brahms' Quintet for Piano and Strings.
That's how I met him.
At a chamber concert.
He was extraordinary.
But he's not comfortable on bigger stages.
He could always try again.
Well done!
-Mom, did you hear? I played it all! -You're very good!
And why are you so good?
Because I have the best teacher ever!
Don't be jealous of them.
The bond with a mother is indissoluble.
It went well. You did well.
You even survived the interrogation from my relatives.
Your mother doesn't give much away.
No. I know her.
-She's happy for us. -Are you happy?
What do you think?
I like the idea of getting married here...
where you grew up.
We can think about it.
What is it?
Sofia?
Well?
Someone was spying on us.
-Who? -Sabrina.
-What are you saying? -I thought I saw her.
-What are you saying? -I thought I saw her. That's impossible, come on.
Love, it's an old house, it's full of drafts.
You heard a noise and got a fright. Everything's all right.
Why is her arm covered in scars?
Look, Sabrina had problems,
my mother started to look after her, she helped her.
They're very close.
Honey?
What happened?
I don't know, it hurts.
What? Let me see.
It's nothing serious.
It'll be OK now.
Everything OK?
She was bitten.
Shouldn't we take her to hospital?
Let me see.
No, we'll put something on it and everything will be fine.
Sofia, remember what I told you about the trees?
My mother can also do it with people.
-What's that? -Some medical herbs.
An old remedy that relieves the pain and disinfects the wound.
I know, it's sore. But you're strong, aren't you?
That's it.
You were very good.
Will you stay and sleep with me?
Of course.
-Good morning, Emma. -Good morning.
You must have got a fright.
A bit.
Unfortunately, these things happen here. What matters is that Sofia's all right.
Where's Francesco?
He went into town, he didn't want to wake you.
His uncle needed help with a piano.
Good morning.
-Hello, Emma. -Hi.
Excuse us, I'll see you later.
Hey!
Is it still sore?
No.
What's that?
You mustn't touch it!
What are you doing?
I'm trying to cure it.
How?
Come.
See?
It's like it was wounded.
It looks like it's crying.
That's right.
But we can save it.
Can you teach me?
Of course.
Put your hand here.
What are you doing?
Honey, are you OK?
-What's this? -It'll help it to heal.
It's a natural remedy. I made it, don't worry.
-Mom. -Be quiet!
-Let me go! -Quiet!
You're hurting me!
OK, what did she do to you?
She wanted to cure me. Like she does with the trees!
She wanted to cure me. Like she does with the trees! Don't believe everything you're told!
-She's Francesco's mom! -I don't care!
They should have asked me.
Sofia, wait!
What's going on?
Your mother was doing something strange to Sofia.
-What? -I don't know!
They gave her something to drink.
It'll be one of her herbal concoctions, I was raised on them.
I don't want other people touching her.
OK, don't worry.
I'll go and speak to her.
Did you hurt yourself?
Come on.
Sorry for before.
I didn't want to be angry with you. I was frightened.
Are you tired?
Yes.
Teresa?
Did you get lost?
I was looking for you. What were you doing to my daughter?
You're getting too worked up. I know what I'm doing.
People come to me for help.
And what do you help them with?
This stuff?
There are things you can't understand.
What? What can't I understand?
Tomorrow morning we're going home.
Why have you kept this stuff?
Mom.
FRANCESCO AND ADA ANNOUNCE THEIR WEDDING, 27 JULY 1980
I'm going to bed. Good night.
-How's Sofia? -Fine.
Sabrina can bring her something to eat.
No need, she's already asleep.
I'll be right up.
Take your time, I'm sleeping with Sofia.
Sofia?
Sofia, what's wrong?
Hey!
Hey! Wake up!
Sofia!
Sofia?
What's wrong?
She was hurting herself in her sleep.
I've never seen her do this.
She's hot.
Let's get her back into bed.
Come on, love, come on.
It's got worse.
She needs a doctor.
Hello, Emma.
You needn't have come. A phone call and we'd have come right away.
Let's go. The doctor's waiting for us.
Has she had nausea, muscle spasms or difficulty breathing?
No.
Has she ever had any other episodes of sleepwalking?
The toxins of tarantulas are weaker than those of bees.
They're disposed of by the body in a matter of a few days.
The wound is following its natural course.
Why is she like this?
It could be an allergy, or her immune defenses are a little low.
It happens.
Her temperature's coming down.
She just needs to rest. A simple antipyretic should do it.
And these drops to be applied twice a day.
OK, Sofia?
Tomorrow I'll come to visit you.
Thank you, Doctor.
Don't worry.
I want to take her home.
Let's wait for the fever to drop.
What if she gets worse?
Let's wait for the medicines to take effect.
I'm not giving that stuff to my daughter.
Emma, you're exaggerating. You heard the doctor.
Sofia.
Sofia, what is it?
What is it?
Please, keep her away. I don't want Sofia to be upset again.
All right.
How is she?
Mom.
I'm here, baby.
Help me, please.
As soon as you're better, we'll go back home, I promise.
-Emma. -What?
We need to talk to you.
Your daughter isn't simply sick.
The medicines won't do anything.
What are you saying?
She has no defenses any more, Emma.
She doesn't even have control of her own body.
Listen to her, I beg you.
Sofia...
has been bound.
What?
Someone's cursed her.
-You two are crazy. -Emma!
Wait!
You have to trust her. My mother knows what she's doing. You have to trust her.
We have to get away from here now!
No!
Sofia!
Sofia!
Open the door!
-Sofia! -Sofia!
Oh, God!
What's that?
What have you done to her?
Answer me!
It's her.
She's come back.
Emma.
There's something I never told you.
When I was still living here...
there was girl who worked for us...
Ada.
We fell in love.
We were kids.
And she got pregnant.
We were meant to get married, but...
At a certain point she fell ill.
I asked my mother to help her...
to cure her.
But there was nothing to be done.
She lost the baby.
And she...
She went mad. She went mad with grief.
We tried to calm her down, but...
At a certain point, she disappeared.
Nobody ever saw her again.
What does this have to do with Sofia?
When the tarantula bit Sofia,
Ada established a binding with her.
She only has to complete the bewitchment, then she'll take her.
But why? What does she want from her?
Because Sofia is like a daughter to Francesco.
And that's all that Ada wants.
A daughter.
-We're telling you the truth. -We only want to protect Sofia.
What do we need to do?
I know how to sever the binding. But we need to hurry.
Nobody's going to hurt her.
-Emma! -Emma!
-Emma! -Emma! Emma, open up!
Emma, please!
-Open the door! -Listen to me!
Come on, Sofia.
Please.
Fuck!
She'll take her.
Look what she did to me.
Sofia.
Sofia!
Sofia?
-Where's Sofia? -I saw her.
Where's Sofia?
Emma.
-Love... -She took her. I saw her.
Calm down.
Wait. Don't move.
I have to find Sofia.
Calm down, Emma.
Calm down.
It's my fault.
It's not your fault. Francesco's gone to look for her.
Listen to me.
At first I didn't understand.
It wasn't a simple binding.
Ada had been touched by something powerful and evil.
Ada?
Ada.
I'd never seen anything like it.
I did everything in my power to save her. That was my duty.
But she ran away.
And nobody ever managed to find her.
But when she felt your presence she reawakened.
What happened to her?
Ada didn't lose the baby because she was ill.
Something happened to her.
And Francesco was to blame.
When Ada became pregnant...
Francesco wasn't ready to be a father.
He was just a boy with his whole life in front of him.
He tried to get her to change her mind, but...
Ada put her foot down, she wanted that child whatever the cost.
So then my son...
made the biggest mistake of his life.
He tried with a ritual.
In secret...
to make her lose the child.
He wanted everything to go back to how it had been,
but he didn't know how to do it.
He didn't have the skill to call on those forces, to control them.
I tried to cure her, but by then it was too late for her.
I had a duty to protect my son.
The same way I tried to protect Sofia.
How can we find her?
Is there a way?
A unification ritual, but it's very dangerous.
The binding with Sofia nourishes Ada.
Every moment that passes she becomes more powerful.
You could end up bound to her.
It doesn't matter.
I have to find my daughter.
I did all this for us.
So you've forgiven me?
Ada...
It's just the three of us.
You just have to understand where they are.
Don't confront her for any reason in the world.
Francesco!
Did you see?
Did Ada realize you were there?
Yes.
We were in a cave.
Francesco was with her as well.
Sofia.
Sofia.
Sofia.
This way.
Help me, please.
I have to purify the blood before cutting the bite.
I have to take her blood and combine it with yours.
It's the only way to bind her to you again.
What's happening?
What's happening?
Sofia?
Sofia, wake up!
She can't hear you.
Take this.
[speaking Italian] In the first batch,
we've got 20 refugees.
All young girls.
Feel free to keep one.
I'm afraid you've got the wrong address.
But the merchandise is excellent. A real bargain.
Some of them are barely 12.
It's a lot of money.
All you need to do is to help us get them here.
My family has never been into this sort of business.
I don't have to do anything.
You're only wasting my time.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.
Think it over.
You'll get a good cut.
Mario.
Fucking assholes.
However, he's a potential business partner.
He deserves our respect.
Even if he is an asshole. What were you looking at?
Oh, my son. You have to be careful.
Beautiful women are heaven for the eyes
-and hell for the soul. -And purgatory for the wallet.
Listen to me.
It's time for you to stop thinking about fun and pleasure.
You have to take on your responsibilities, okay?
One day, all of this... will be yours.

[man, in English] We are terribly sorry, but it was possible to regain
only 12 percent of your family's assets.
In the future, we recommend a more heterogeneous investment portfolio.
You recommend?
This investment was also highly recommended by you.
-Good evening. -Good evening.
-Good evening. -Good evening. WARSAW
[in Polish] Have you packed your shit already?
[in English] Please, could anyone tell me what the hell happened here yesterday?
I expect a refund
and five percent interest.
[man] It's impossible. -Refund, and ten percent interest. -[door slams]
Until the end of the month.
My question is:
How the fuck...
did it happen?
You should ask Ms. Biel.
Excuse my language,
but you need to have balls to do this job.
This conversation is over.
-This is America. -[shushing]
[man] Ms. Biel?
-First of all, it's not my fault. -Listen, ma'am--
I haven't finished yet.
And it's not my job to temper rowdy customers.
And I think you should rather tell us
why, in the entire building,
there were only two security guards.
Word... It is all about word that you've given to my family.
What is it?
You have this game in America, right?
Trick or treat.
I checked in the band at our hotel on purpose.
And because of yesterday's incident, we are in media from the US to Japan.
[young man] I thought that when it comes to sexual preferences,
nothing would surprise me,
but you...
What would your loving husband say about that?
Your kids? Shareholders?
Shall I continue?
You've embarrassed us in the eyes of entire world.
We all know how the media and the stock market will react
when I make it all public.
There have been so many reservations
that we are overbooked for the next four weekends.
[young man] After a week...
bank shares will fall by half.
It was possible because of my strategy.
Age and sex had nothing to do with it.
After a month, I will buy it for peanuts,
only to...
[in Polish] This is exactly what you need balls for.
[in English] ...fire you all.
In my office. Right away.
What are you gonna do about my money?
[in Polish] Hi, honey.
Damn, I have to finish this.
Give me like half an hour, okay?
Can't you just take a small break?
Yeah, sure.
You must be tired.
We have a plane to catch in the morning.
You shouldn't strain yourself with that weak heart of yours.
Besides, you probably haven't packed for us yet, right?
[in Italian] I'm going to kill them.
[young man] What's the matter?
Somebody has taken our container with the cocaine.
[in Polish] Let's drink to the health of the sexiest, the best, and most wonderful woman in the world...
and most wonderful woman in the world...
my mother.
I was just kidding! I'm sorry. I meant my lovely Laura,
who will, in a second, turn... 29.
[Laura] Come on, you make me feel old.
[woman] Old, but still kicking.
[repeating, in Italian] One moment.
[in Italian] Today is the birthday...
of my beautiful girlfriend, Laura.
Please, give me a hand.
[in Polish] What are you up to?
[in Italian] Yes?
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
Yes, thank you.
♪ Happy birthday, Laura ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
-[repeating] Bravo! -[cheers and applause]
[in Polish] Cheers.
Jesus, Martin, you are such a dumbass.
-My favorite. You remembered. -Aww.
-[Martin] But... -What?
To be honest... I didn't order it.
Maybe it's on the house?
All right, so we probably should drink to--
No. Wait, I have to go to the bathroom.
Can't fight Maslow's pyramid.
[in English] Are you lost, baby girl?
-It was just like him. -Yeah.
[in Polish] Look! Our wine is here. That's what I'm talking about.
Grazie.
[in English] Okay, thank you.
[in Polish] God, why do these seagulls have to be so loud?
Where is Michał-angelo?
As you can see, the child is playing in the wading pool.
What about Martin?
I don't know. He wasn't there when I woke up.
I don't know where he is. He doesn't answer his phone.
What? But it's your birthday.
You don't say.
The next one is just a year away.
You know what? I'm not the most important thing to him.
In Martin's hierarchy, I'm way behind his buddies and his work.
And most importantly, way behind him.
Hi, honey.
How are you? How about lunch?
Lunch? Sure. Where were you?
Etna. You were sleeping like a log. Didn't want to wake you. Time's a-wasting.
Yeah, time's a-wasting. Did you have fun?
Jesus. It was fucking awesome.
You would have liked it.
You can experience the sea and snow at the same time. Cool!
Idiot! Don't you remember? We were supposed to go there together!
Why have you left me all alone on my birthday?
[Martin] Jesus. Don't get so worked up.
With your weak heart, you shouldn't do that.
Fuck off with that heart argument again.
Do you care about anything other than yourself?
-What am I to you? -You think I don't care about you?
I've been looking for this for over an hour.
See? It's for you.
Mmm. Thank you very much.
-Now, fuck off! -[shouts]
[in Italian] Good evening.
[in Polish] Fuck me.
[in English] Are you lost, baby girl?
You...
Suck it.
You had a bad reaction to the sedative.
I didn't know you have a heart problem.
Suck it yourself.
Why am I here? Who the fuck you are? And why are you keeping me here?
Answer me.
-Sit. I don't want you to faint again. -Answer me.
-Sit down. -I'm not your property!
Sit the fuck down.
Do you wanna know why you are here, or not?
Thank you. I think you should have a drink.
What I am about to tell you is so incredible that I...
I wouldn't have believed it's true until I saw you at the airport.
In that moment, I understood that...
it wasn't only my imagination.
Five years ago, my whole life was changed.
My father died...
in front of my eyes.
The bullet went through his heart...
and hit me.
I thought I would die too.
When my heart stop, I saw you.
Every day, I had this image in front of my eyes.
I was looking for you around the world.
Somewhere inside me,
I had this feeling of certainty that...
one day you would stand in front of me and be mine.
[Laura] You must be kidding.
Nobody owns me. I'm not an object.
You can't have me just like that; kidnap me and think that I'm all yours.
I know.
But that's why I'm giving you a chance to fall in love with me.
Not because I made you do it,
because you will want to.
But I've got a boyfriend who is going to look for me.
I've got family, friends...
I've got my own life.
I don't need a chance for love from you!
So, I kindly ask you to let me the fuck out!
Your boyfriend doesn't deserve you.
My people have taken your stuff from the room...
and left a note for Martin.
It says that...
you're coming back to Poland, moving out...
disappearing from his life.
You know what?
Fuck off.
I won't do anything without your permission.
I'll wait until you want me,
you desire me, and come to me yourself.
I won't tie you up,
but don't provoke me.
I can't be gentle.
I'm not used to tolerating disobedience.
You have 365 days.
I'd do anything so you can fall in love with me.
If next year, on your birthday, nothing change, I'll set you free.
Okay.
Now, you put down the gun...
or this will be stop being funny.
Do you really wanna kill me?
Many have tried. It's not that easy.
[in Italian] Excuse me.
There's been a delivery.
You need to sign.
Take her to her room.
[in English] Okay, let's go.
[in Italian] Massimo. There will be problems.
The conflict with the Gattuso family
might ruin the business.
Mind your own business.
I'm doing it. It is my duty to protect the family and you.
Even from yourself.
Shoot me.
Get everyone here.
Here comes Massimo the Great.
What are you going to do to me? Beat me? Cut off my balls?
If you'd only stolen from me, you'd be off the hook now.
But you decided to sell children to a brothel.
Did you think I wouldn't find out?
-We all have skeletons in the closet-- -Shut up.
You have smeared the name of this family, Alfredo.
What family?
What values?
Spare me this bullshit, and shoot me.
You will be erased.
No trace will be left of you...
as if you never existed.
That's your punishment.
You see those marks?
-Unbelievable. -The scumbag.
Fuck.
[in English] How are you feeling?
You shouldn't have seen it.
But you have to know that he deserved it.
He had been hurting children.
Cheating and stealing on his family.
We don't forgive it.
He killed himself with what he'd been doing.
It wasn't me who changed your clothes. It was the maid.
You have people for everything.
It's... It's one of the advantages of being a boss.
So, tell one of your butlers to bring my cell phone and laptop.
I can see you've got your strength back.
You will have your cell phone and your laptop
when it's the right time.
Now...
if you need anything, Domenico is here to help you.
Be ready in two hours, because we need to buy some stuff
before we depart.
Depart? Where to? What are you talking about?
I'm not flying anywhere, unless it's Poland.
It wasn't an offer;
-it was an order. -Listen to me,
I'm not a bag of potatoes
that you can transfer without my permission.
If that's your idea of how falling in love with you looks,
you're fucking wrong.
If you hit me again...
What? You will kill me?
This is what you call a temper?
How come you're not Italian?
How many Polish girls do you know?
It looks like one is all I need to know.
It will be a good year.
I just need to react quicker,
'cause I lose my vigilance when I'm around you.
Domenico brought all of your stuff.
Impressive amount of shoes for a five-day holiday.
Breakfast is ready, miss.
I'll do my best to help you.
I think your boss wants me to gain weight.
I think he just wants to take good care of you, you know?
But I think you're here to help me with everything what I need.
So, I need you to sit down...
and help me to eat.
Okay.
Today, I have some business to take care of.
You will accompany me.
I said, I'm not going anywhere.
[Massimo] Etna.
Known also as "Mongibello,"
"beautiful mountain."
Legend says that Zeus used to hide Typhon there--
a monster of 100 heads--
and that it's still trying to escape.
So, Typhon didn't fall in love with Zeus in 365 days.
Get out!
-Get out, or else I-- -Else what?
Or I guarantee you, this is the last time you'll see it.
I've order it,
and I'm gonna decide when I'm going to see it.
See it on yourself.
[in Italian] No, wait.
[in English] Please, I need help. Can you help me?
Someone kidnapped me, and I need help.
Can you help me?
[in Italian] Good morning, sir.
[in English] Are you lost, baby girl?
If you feel like running, you should wear a different kind of shoes.
Sometimes, fighting is futile.
You have to accept the situation.
The faster, the better for you.
You can either make it hard for both of us for the next year, or...
take part in an adventure that fate has given you.
It wasn't fate;
it was you.
Sometimes, we have to make our own luck.
Is it true what you said earlier?
What do you mean?
That you won't touch me without my permission.
I'm not the monster you think I am.
I want my cell phone and laptop. Now.
And something normal for dinner.
Pierogi.
-You look-- -[Laura] I'm starving.
As you wished...
pierogi.
Is it good?
My grandma makes them better.
But you don't have to kill him.
I will give him couple of lessons.
So, what do you actually do?
ANNA WHY ARE YOU NOT REPLYING?
I'M NOT GIVING UP!
I do...
business.
Massimo, I'm serious.
You want me to accept a year-long declaration,
I have rights to know what's waiting for me.
You will know exactly what you need to know.
I have few...
companies,
hotels, clubs, restaurants.
It's like a corporation,
and I'm the CEO.
The whole is a part of a bigger operation.
But the details are useless...
and dangerous.
I was chosen the head of this family after my dad's death.
It was not what I wished for.
I had no choice.
Exactly like me.
I would never have come to Sicily.
You'll change your mind.
You just have to...
help me a little.
Help?
I'd like you...
to teach me...
how to be gentle...
for you.
[in Polish] Mom.
Yeah, everything is fine.
I have to tell you something, though. I was offered a new job in Sicily.
It's the best hotel on the island.
I was given a yearly contract.
Come on, stop worrying. You'll see.
You'll come to visit and fall in love with the place as I have.
[in English] We're leaving today.
We'll be guests at a few offshore parties,
so take that under consideration while packing your bag.
Do you want anything from me, or you're just looking?
Why are you looking at it?
Do you wanna touch it?
Baby girl...
when your entire life is based on taking everything with force,
it's hard to react in a different way.
Especially if someone is taking away a pleasure you really desire...
Don't provoke me.
Or what?
[in Italian] She's got quite a temper.
At least I won't get bored.
Good luck, Massimo.
Let's go.
[in English] You comfortable enough?
[in Polish] Just untie me, you fucking wop, and I'll show you...
[in English] English, please.
You have to earn the pleasure.
[in Italian] The problem is,
after the elections...
the whole deal might blow up.
We just need to pay them more.
Did you find her? Did you?
And how is she?
Are you happy?
Like everything.
It's difficult.
It always is.
[in English] Are you talking about me?
I've just said to my cousin that you're a marvelous, gentle woman.
-Yeah. -Yeah.
Can you stop it?
I'm bored.
-I'm dirty. -Stop it.
[in Italian] Is she going to bathe in the fountain?
-No, she isn't. -Is she?
-No. -Wanna bet?
No, she won't do it.
[in English] Couldn't you use the bathroom?
Fountain was closer.
Of course.
[in Polish] Fuck!
[in English] Which period is that? Early Michelangelo or late Caravaggio?
It was a gift.
Yeah, sure.
Not that you're a megalomaniac.
The great Massimo,
the slayer of lions and tiny women.
Stop it.
Maybe I don't want to stop.
-[Massimo] Take it. -[scoffs]
In your dreams.
Are you saying no?
You have people for everything.
So, let them to this.
Are you sure?
Open the door. I want to leave.
Let me out. Open the door.
-Open this fucking door. -Shh...
-Sit on the bed. -[gasps]
[grunts] Fuck!
Fuck!
I'll do anything I want with you.
I was hoping you would do that.
It's a telescopic tube.
Every time you move, it widens more and more.
I'm gonna show you what you're missing.
You see, Laura...
at this moment,
you're immobilized enough...
that you can't resist me anymore.
At the same time...
I have access to absolutely every bit of your body.
[Laura] Please...
Are you asking me to begin?
I'm gonna fuck you so hard...
that they will hear you scream in Warsaw.
I'm begging you.
Dress up.
We need to be in one of my clubs in two hours.
Listen to me.
He's gonna kill you.
And then, he's gonna kill me.
Shall we?
Listen, Laura.
We won't be alone, okay?
Some people will join us,
and we will have to discuss some matters with them.
"Some people, some matters."
You are going to play Mafia, aren't you?
Listen, Laura.
This is not a fucking joke, okay?
Just keep your head down.
[in Italian] Hi, gorgeous.
[in English] Okay, you wait here. Just one minute.
What the hell are you wearing?
A couple thousand euro of yours.
Don't provoke me.
Why?
Are you afraid that I am too good at it?
My dress is so short,
and could get inside me without taking it off.
You will be mine. I guarantee it.
Then I'll do anything I want,
anytime I want with you.
Keep on dreaming.
[in Italian] Finally, a real whore.
I'm going to fuck you so hard, you won't be able to sit.
Come here.
-[grunting] -Come here.
-[man laughing] -Fuck!
Get out!
[Mario, in Italian] I told you a thousand times.
Enough!
Just do your fucking duty.
Are you aware who you have shot, Massimo?
Do you know what you've done?
[Massimo] I couldn't just sit there and watch.
This means war. A war between two powerful families.
Do you get that?
The only thing you can do is to get rid of Laura.
Do that and ask Anna for forgiveness.
And get rid of this damn boat, too.
Hey! Watch your fucking mouth!
[Laura, in English] I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
I'm sorry, I didn't think...
Yeah, you didn't think.
[Laura] What's going on? Did you kill him? -[Massimo] It's none of your business. -You killed him?
-[Massimo] It's none of your business. -You killed him?
I shot his hands. I wouldn't have had to do it
if you didn't dress like a whore and put on your little show.
So, that's my fault that your friend tried to rape me?
That's my fault?
Fuck off.
Enough.
-[Massimo] Laura. -[in Polish] Fuck off!
-[in English] Fuck off! Leave me alone. -Where you going?
-Stop it. Where are you going? -No. Get off me.
Laura, where are you going?
Fuck you.
-Can you stop that? -Fuck!
Stop it!
-Don't touch me! Fuck you! -Stop it!
-What are you doing? -Fuck!
[in Italian] Fuck!
Laura!
[in English] Laura, breathe! Breathe.
Hey. Hey.
Okay?
[Massimo] I'm so grateful that you're alive.
But in the same time, I wanna kill you.
You saved me.
Thank God I was so close.
Why are you so disobedient?
I'm sorry.
You have to understand...
[Laura] I won't do it anymore.
I can't lose you. I don't want to.
You have to rest.
You're wet.
Don't play with me.
Mmm. I want more.
We slept only one hour.
Are you tired already?
No.
I just wonder if you aren't too tired for an evening surprise.
-I'm afraid of your surprises. -[chuckles]
You'll like it.
What is it?
We're going to a ball.
A ball?
With the nice, long dresses?
Uh-huh.
Are you fucking crazy? I have nothing to wear!
-[chuckles] -Fuck!
So...
do you mind if I ask you to dance with me?
Don Massimo, you're asking?
How surprising.
[woman] Bravo.
Bravo.
Beautiful dance.
[Laura] Thank you.
[in Italian] So, you've found her?
Laura.
Anna.
[in English] The first and real love of Massimo.
[in Italian] What do you want?
I expected better.
Enough.
Shall I kill her?
I'll take the most precious thing you have.
Like you did to me.
[Laura, in English] Well?
I'm waiting.
[Massimo] Anna...
is quite recent.
How recent?
I left her the day you landed in Sicily.
I never lied to her.
Your portraits have been hanging in my house for years.
Nobody believed that I will ever find you.
And... she didn't believe at all.
What did she say?
It doesn't matter.
I want to know.
She said that...
she will kill you.
Laura...
I will never let anyone hurt you.
I'll take care of her.
I want to leave.
Now.
Domenico will take you to the airport tomorrow.
Your flight is at 8:00.
What?
What flight?
To Poland.
What are you talking about?
You said that you want to visit your family.
-Yes, but-- -There's an apartment waiting for you
in Warsaw.
I'll join you there soon.
I love you.
[Domenico] I mean, come on.
Forget about Anna.
She's the past.
Is she?
Yes.
And you, my darling,
you are the fucking future.
Where exactly is she?
Well... Sorry.
[in Italian] Hello?
Stop.
[in English] What's going on?
Domenico, what happened?
Wait in Warsaw.
What?
Wait in Warsaw.
Domenico?
[in Polish] Laura, no fucking way!
I wasn't talking to you. I'll call you back.
I am going to kill you!
I thought you were kidnapped!
Just tell me one thing, okay?
What happened in fucking Sicily?
-Martin. I had enough of him. -Did he piss you off?
I fell in love.
What the fuck?
Jesus, I know it sounds ridiculous. I didn't want it, but things happened.
Fucking great.
Don't make me force it out of you. Tell me, who is it?
He is... special.
What do you mean? He's got special needs? Is he sick?
I know, he has flat feet.
Olga, shut up!
Tell me!
Imagine a strong alpha male, who always knows what he wants.
He is your caretaker and your defender.
When you are with him, you feel like a little girl.
He makes all your sexual fantasies come true.
What's more, he is one meter, 90 centimeters tall,
has absolutely no body fat, and has been molded by God himself.
Did God mold his dick, too?
The devil did.
Fuck me. [chuckles]
So, what about him?
-We have to think this through. -Mm-hmm.
He comes from a rich, traditional Sicilian family.
They don't take foreigners for wives.
Right, now spare me the bullshit.
Tell me the truth.
Olga, I'm fucked up.
I was kidnapped by a gangster, and then I fell in love with him.
And the worst thing is that they keep me in the dark.
They treat me like some kind of doll.
They sent me to Poland, and I still don't know a single thing.
That's why you need to fucking back out. Do you understand?
Fuck all the Massimos, Martins, and all the other mozzarellas.
It's time for a change.
A change of undies.
-We are going out. -What?
[Laura] What are you doing?
I'm conditioning my neighbors.
Hi, bitches!
Darius, just fucking look at you! Please, don't leave, though.
Can you tell me why you woke me up in the middle of the night? It's 1:00 p.m.
Fucking rejuvenation time!
Just look at her!
-[in English] Yeah, bad. -Mmm.
[in Polish] How about some glasses?
Greg, I want some volume here.
Hello?
What? Did you suddenly have a stroke?
I was offered the position of general manager at Preston.
You will be fucking General Preston!
Fucking shit!
Great. Mozzarella turned her brain into pesto.
Now, that is some serious volume.
You're right. I'm not going to just lie down and smell nice.
I'd like to lie down and smell nice...
Hey! Stand in line!
There is a line to your ass.
-Did you hurt yourself? -[laughs]
When falling down from heaven?
-Bye. -♪ 'Cause I'm here looking fine, babe ♪
It's for you. From that gentleman.
-Mm-hmm. -No.
Laura.
Hi. [clears throat]
Where were you all this time?
Can we talk?
I have nothing to say to you.
Laura, please. At least let me explain, and then I'll leave.
Explain how your dick ended up in a different girl's ass?
The moment you ran off from that pool...
I thought this through. You were right. I ran after you, but you weren't there.
I started looking for you. It got dark, so I went back to the hotel.
I found your letter, read it... and lost my mind.
I decided I needed to get fucked up. I called Michał...
And please, believe me...
that fucking first drink was the last thing that I remember
from that evening.
When I woke up...
It doesn't change a thing if you remember or not.
You slept with another girl.
But...
There are no "buts," Martin!
We belong to two different worlds. There is no room for a woman in your life.
And I am not going to be your toy. Do you understand?
It's all true, Laura.
But that is in the past.
I came to realize that...
I really love you.
I think I'm gonna puke.
I'm going home.
-Just five minutes. -Goodbye!
Laura, I really miss you.
-But I don't miss you. -So, it was all fake?
There was nothing between us?
It wasn't fake, but it wasn't a healthy relationship.
-Honey, let's talk. -We have nothing to talk about!
-Don't you get it? Nothing! -We do.
No! You have already told me what you had to say.
No, leave me alone!
-Bye! -Wait!
-Bye! -Wait!
[Massimo, in English] I don't understand what you two are saying,
but it's rather clear that she wants you to leave.
Do I have to say it so you'll understand?
Martin. Massimo.
Meet each other.
But I think you've already met Martin.
[in Polish] Martin, come in! Come in, please!
You are drunk.
We'll keep in touch.
[in English] Where have you been?
Do you have any idea what I've been through?
You look stunning, baby girl.
"You look stunning, baby girl."
You're a fucking egoist.
How could you?
How could you? You fuck!
What's this?
Nothing.
I solved it.
What's going on?
What's going on?
I don't need 365 days.
Because?
'Cause I love you.
Say it again.
I love you.
Will you marry me?
-[in Polish] Fuck. -[chuckles]
[in English] Does it mean "yes"?
Yes.
-♪ All this magic in the air ♪ -No.
-Wanna bet? -♪ Secured my place, I'm here to stay ♪
Calm down.
Everything will be fine.
I'm calm.
But do me a favor, and don't tell them exactly what you do.
What do you want me to say?
I don't know.
Improvise.
[in Polish] Laura! You look great as a blonde!
You look so pale, though.
Are you all right?
Mom...
Klara Biel.
[in English] Massimo. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
-Tomasz Biel. -My pleasure. Massimo.
[in Polish] Who is he? And what does he do?
[in English] My mom is asking what do you do for a living.
I'm a gangster.
[laughs] Really? You will be the first in our family.
So, what are your intentions with our daughter?
Only the evil ones.
[Tomasz] We have to talk seriously.
-You like vodka? -Yeah.
-Sure. -Tomek!
Don't be so rude.
[in Polish] Well!
[in Italian] Good morning.
Good morning.
[in English] Sorry we didn't wait for you, but I have to travel to Palermo.
It's okay. I'm not hungry yet.
I don't feel well.
-What's going on? -Well, nothing, really.
Domenico will take you to the doctor.
[Laura] Honey...
you said that...
nobody from Poland can come to our wedding.
Even my parents.
You said it yourself that you don't want them to know what I do.
Yes.
But I would love to have my best friend to be next to me.
Olga knows everything about you.
I need her.
[Massimo] All right.
She'll be your bridesmaid.
I have to go now.
-Ciao, Mario. -Come back soon.
I think you don't like me, Mario.
[Mario] It's not true.
Stop it, I'm not blind.
It's nothing personal.
I don't like this situation.
You know...
that you have caused some commotion...
in our family.
I will arrange...
your friend's arrival.
I just hope...
she's calmer than you are.
[Laura] Olga!
[in Polish] What a ride! Fuck me!
I can't believe it! Are you fucking out of your mind?
You have known each other for two months!
Stop it. Give me one.
You are pregnant.
I'll smoke two for your sake.
Fuck!
I don't get it. He forced you, right?
I'll tear him apart when I see him!
Olga, he doesn't know I'm pregnant!
He doesn't. And when he proposed, I said yes willingly.
Laura, you are trapped in a cage!
Don't you see it? It's a golden cage, but you are still a fucking prisoner!
Do you know what you are up against?
Olga, stop it!
What are you talking about? A cage?
-What am I supposed to do? -I don't know.
Stop yelling. Do you take me for a fool? You think I didn't know what I was doing?
Come here.
I love you, do you hear me?
I will always be there for you.
We will raise the child together.
It will be a beautiful child with beautiful parents.
Not smart, though, but still.
[Domenico, in English] Hey, girls!
Come on, I'm waiting here!
We're coming, sir!
[in Polish] How long do we have to wait?
How long can you pamper yourself?
[in English] It's, uh...
-You know... -[door opens]
[in Polish] Fuck!
Yeah...
I want to be with him and keep the child.
I know.
[Laura, in Polish] Well, you could stay for a while in Sicily.
Fast cars, motorboats, good food.
Horny Italians.
Well, I don't know.
A lot of horny Italians!
What do you think I am here for?
Hell yeah!
[Olga] Okay, stop talking me up. Just call him.
-[Laura] But-- -[Olga] Call him.
[in Italian] What's up?
[man] They're about to kill Laura.
Are you sure?
[man] Yes, I'm sure.
Marco... go.
Go, Marco! Go!
[in English] Hi, honey.
[Massimo] How long does it take to try on a dress?
As long as it takes.
I miss you.
[Laura] I miss you too.
[in Italian] Oh, fuck!
Massimo...
[in Italian] Go!
[in English] Can we talk after dinner?
[Massimo] About what?
Did something happen?
-[in Italian] Where is Massimo? -By the swimming pool.
Of, fuck.
Laura?
Laura?
This is the story of Hannah Goslar.
For dramatic purposes, it sometimes has been condensed or adapted.
Will you give me the champagne, please? Of course.
Anne.
So tell me, Hanneli, have you French kissed with Alfred yet?
-Of course not. -Jonas Sammer wants to do it with me.
-Anne Frank, you're not going… -28, 27…
That you're such a decent girl, Hannah Elisabeth.
…that we have the goods in stock, but in light of the current situation…
26, 25…
-Come. -Where are you going?
23…
…so some delay may be possible as far as the delivery is concerned.
22…
Here, this way.
This door is always closed.
-Anne, come back. -No, come. Are you scared?
-4, 3, 2… -Come.
-1. -Anne, come back.
Ready or not, here I come!
Girls, get away from the window.
1945, BERGEN-BELSEN EXCHANGE CAMP
No, Gabi.
-No, Gabi, we don't do that. -I'm hungry.
You not leave Gabi alone.
Go, now.
Halt.
Attention, halt. Halt, halt, I said.
Halt, halt, I said.
Heil Hitler.

Go back.
-Where were you? -I had this to write.
To whom?
-Come. -But I have Gabi.
-Come. -But I have Gabi. You can put her to bed, can't you?
-But you only borrowed it yesterday. -Yes, but Dad said I had to return it.
-Why? -He didn't want to say,
Maybe they're traitors.
-Look, Margot's very last ball. -Stolen?
Borrowed. She'll never notice. Look, like this.
Come, let's pretend we're tossing the ball. You here, me over there.
Anne, your French kisser is there.
-Shall I call Jonas? -No.
Go on, you did it. It was your fault.
Cover your eyes with your hands. And think: How would Anne do it?
I sometimes do so too and think: How would Vati do it, or Margot?
Come on, it really helps. Yes.
How would Anne do this?
Yes?
-Can I please have my ball back? -Ah, she speaks German.
I was born in Frankfurt am Main.
My father fought for Germany in the great war.
It was my fault, I'm sorry.
It was my fault, I'm sorry. But we borrowed the ball and have to return it.
Name and documents.
You can pick it up this evening at our place in the Bumsstrasse.
Hanneli, promise me this: we'll never speak German again.
Except to say Scheisshunden.
And auf Wiederscheissen, wankers.
How many spots does it have?
-Hello. -Hi.
-Six. -You will have six children.
I want ten.
Dear Jonas…
I hope you rot in hell.
Look for someone else to stick your long tongue in.
See you never again. And may you sink in shit.
Your loving Anne Frank.
Will you promise to stay with me forever?
Fifty-seven.
Fifty-eight.
Fifty-nine.
-Stand straight! -Filthy cow!
Sixty.
Where is that slut?
Where is that whore?
Here.
Well… Sixty-two.
Sixty-three.
Sixty-four.
Gabi…
you know, behind that fence, Anne lives there.
Who's Anne?
Come, we're going to Anne.
What are you doing? You danger to us. Go back.
Halt. What's going on here?
You like that, don't you?
Tasty sausage for my faithful dog. Eat your heart out, my friend.
Good doggy.
-I'm hungry too -Just a little while, okay?
-I'm hungry. -Stupid cows, walk on.
Shall we go shopping? Yes?
You see that dairy over there? They sell fresh milk and eggs.
And next to it is the bakery. Fresh bread, do you smell it?
Or we'll go to the De Bijenkorf.
They have lollipops as big as your head, every colour of the rainbow.
I have to go.
I'll hang it up here, okay? I'll see you tonight at The Little Dipper.
-Wait. -Anne, wait.
Anne, I…I have a surprise for you.
-What kind of surprise? -If you come with me, I'll show you.
-Anne. -Especially for you, pretty lady.
Come.
Anne.
-You were going to stay with me forever. -And you not with me?
JEWS NOT ALLOWED
We'll go round the back.
Do you remember the time that food got thrown away in the Netherlands?
Do you remember the time that our delightful butter,
with government funding, got exported to England,
so that the Englishman could butter his bread economically?
While the Dutch worker had to eat his bread with expensive margarine.

Sit down here.
Dad says it's not forbidden for Jewish girls to watch the back of the screen.
National girls leader van Eck presented the group leader
and the other girls to him.
Do you know that I dreamed about you? Really?
-What was the dream about? -Yes, how should I explain it?
During the festivities, the leader showed his interest
by personally conversing with the girls.
His attention especially concerned the task of the young women to contribute to the formation of a single-minded Dutch nation.
to contribute to the formation of a single-minded Dutch nation.
We were at the cinema, just the two of us.
And it was a very romantic movie.
Whisper something in my ear. No matter what, just keep talking.
-Help me if he goes too far, okay? -What?
Oh, yes.
I also want to see the wide world.
As an actress or a writer.
But only a very famous one.
Why? Look, these women want to help people.
-I do too when I'm older. -Then you should talk to my sister.
She wants to become Florence Nightingale in Palestine.
Really?
Dad also wants to go there. If he manages to get passports, that is.
Is something wrong?
I'd like to go home.
Did you tell him about your jaundice?
Isn't it very contagious?
Come, let's go.
Jaundice, really? Brilliant.
Yes.
JEWISH QUARTER
It stinks here.
Come.
Hannah. What got into you? Gabi fell out of her bed.
-Whose fault is that? -Sorry, I went to return that book.
-Let me guess. With Anne. -What makes you say that?
Is something wrong?
Dad, what is it?
How can that be?
We want to leave a country that doesn't want us
and yet they won't let us go. I don't understand. I really don't.
Have faith, my dear ones.
Faith…
I'm sure it will all work out.
Dad, I can ask Anna's father if he is able to obtain passports.
-I'm going to The Little Dipper anyway. -Oh no, out of the question.
You're going to your room to think about never leaving Gabi alone again.
-But Anne is also coming. -No, no table tennis today.
-But Anne is also coming. -No, no table tennis today. -Go to your room, Hannah. -Dad, it's not fair.
-Go to your room, Hannah. -Dad, it's not fair.
If Otto were able to obtain passports, they'd have long been gone.
Not a word to anyone.
-Including Anne. -Anne? Why would I?
-Including Anne. -Anne? Why would I? Our little secret.
For you, here.
One day it will make you very happy.
Keep it in a safe place.
Dad?
I lost Margot's last tennis ball.
Can I go through Aunt Sarah's things to see if I can find one?
No.
But you said that Aunt Sarah will probably never come back again.
You don't talk back to your father.
Forgive me for coming by this late, but it's extremely urgent.
-Come on in. -Good evening, Mr. Frank.
Anne asks if you'll come to The Little Dipper.
No, not today.
I saw a Florence Nightingale today, at the cinema.
At the cinema? Did you go to the cinema?
-Was Anne there as well? -Well, but no one saw us.
-Dear God, what did I do to deserve this? -Hannah, any idea how dangerous that is?
-Dear God, what did I do to deserve this? -Hannah, any idea how dangerous that is? -You can bring us all in danger that way. -Yes, I realise that now.
-You can bring us all in danger that way. -Yes, I realise that now. -And so does Anne. -Good.
Then we'll leave it for now. What do you say, Hans?
We have something urgent to discuss.
You know what, I'll ask Margot if she'll lend you her Florence Nightingale book.
No books. If you like it so much, you can play Florence Nightingale here every day.
With a baby coming, Mother needs you. This is no time for daydreaming.
The Saucepan over there has seven stars.
One of them is me. And the biggest is Anne.
Our club only has five members. That's why it's called The Little Dipper. Minus two.
So, sleep tight, little one.
-You only want to take Hannah along? -Yes.
What if Gabi starts crying? Or the new baby?
-Otto, wait. -Hans, think about Hannah.
Anna and her. Then they'll at least have each other.
That is very kind of you, dear Otto. But it would make it too complicated for us if we let Hannah come with you.
But it would make it too complicated for us if we let Hannah come with you. Do you understand that?
I do, Hans, But I'd really regret to see it go wrong.
I'd gladly take her with us, but…
Hannah?
Hannah, is that you?
That's what I mean. Exactly that.
The smallest sound can betray us.
-Hi, Hannah. -Hi.
-Hello, Hannah. -Hey.
Margot, would Anne be…
Gabble gabble gabble.
Here, watch this.
-Anne. -Yes?
-Anne. -Yes? Look.
Exactly like Margot's.
Exactly our old one.
-Hi. -Hi.
Do you still play with balls, Hannah?
Hey, Hannah, Anne has a question for you.
But you'd better know the answer or you lose your membership of The Little Dipper.
-I thought membership was forever. -Absolutely, if you know the answer.
-Anne and I founded the club. -It has to do with your mother's baby.
How did it get into her belly?
-She doesn't know. -I do too.
Oh yeah? How?
If you don't know, I'm not going to tell you.
You see, Anne, she doesn't know.
Coco. Come sit here.
Good morning. Books out.
Come in.
Sir, Mrs. Appel is still not here.
Do you know if she's still coming?
Sir, we've plenty of seats left.
Why don't you all find a seat?
Hannah, if you would lead us in song.
Butler has a rocking horse
Without a head and without a tail
And so he rides around the world In his naked…

Open up.
Gabi, come.
Put your coat on.
-Hannah Goslar. -Maybe we get to leave.
-Are we being exchanged? -No.
-Come. -Keniechel.
Keniechel.
Look.
That lady is still asleep.
-The girl is sick. -Open the gate.
So, pretty lady, the girl is sick?
Pretty lady.
I want a bite.
Not now.
Quick.
Come along.
Daddy?
Dad?
I'm doing well. Don't worry.
What other way to see my little angels?
We're leaving tomorrow. The three of us are finally at the top of the list.
The three of us will be exchanged for one German POW.
We finally get to leave. I'll see you tomorrow morning at the station.
Keniechel is also coming.
Come.
-Great. -Hannah.
-Come. Come. -Great. Finally, dad. Finally.
Come.
Tomorrow, on the train.
Bye, daddy.
Crows.
Come.
Gabi, tomorrow we're going home.
-Do you also crave cookies and chicken? -What is chicken?
Or lollipops?
Keniechel.
Come, move it.
Keniechel will come to the train. Come.
You are bugs!
That have to be crushed under our feet!
Get up! You!
Stupid cows, faster.
Come on.
Halt.
Hands up. Hands up. Don't move.
Come, to the shelter.
I'm sick, I want to go to the toilet.
Everyone joins in. You too join in.
Oh oh I'm so glad
Anne, I'm coming
Oh oh I have such an ugly mug
We're going to Switzerland.
And now?
Dad, Hannah was wondering what 'jodefidefo' means, right?
And Anne was wondering when we're going to play hide-and-seek again.
-Well, next time. -You always say that. What does it mean?
-Why are you standing there for? -And when are we going to Switzerland?
-As soon as we can. -And what are you doing?
I thought I heard something.
-Did you hear anything? -Who?
-You. -Me?
No, Alfred.
Dad's been acting so unusual lately. So odd.
-Anne? -Yes?
I have to go home to get something. Don't open the door if the bell rings.
I have to go home to get something. Don't open the door if the bell rings. No one ever stops by on Sunday.
-And don't make phonecalls. -Yes, Dad.
Because Jews aren't allowed to make phone calls…
And don't go to the annex. Do you promise me that?
-What annex? -Anne, no fooling around, I'm serious.
-Anne, look at me. -No, Dad.
-Anne, look at me. -No, Dad. And we won't peek oit of the window.
Hanneli, will you keep an eye on the little girl?
Come, let's make a phone call.
-Hello, Mrs. Jansen speaking. -Hello, madam, this is Anne.
-Could I perhaps talk to Alfred? -Anne.
Hi, Alfred, it's Anne. I was wondering, would you like to go out with Hannah? Give up.
Hannah would like to French kiss with you.
Alfred?
There's no Alfred living here. Who is this? Hello? Hello?
-Keniechel, Keniechel -Say "thank you, Hannah".
Thank you, Hannah.
Alright.
I'm leaving already.
Hannah.
Frau Eva wants to see children again.
Her children.
She saved lives. Back home.
She saved my life. And others.
That's why you respect Frau.
Much respect for Frau Eva.
You leave tomorrow.
Exchanged.
You have father.
You have Gabi.
We don't.
I don't.
You extra respect for Frau.
Anne?
-Do you have food? -Is anyone there?
-Hallo? -Anne? Anne, is that you?
No, I'm not Anne.
Are you looking for Anne?
Yes, Anne Frank.
Anne talks a lot. She must talk everyone's ears off there.
She also has a sister, Margot. With round glasses.
-Anne has beautiful black hair. -Hair?
-Do you still have hair? -Yes.
If Anne is there, can you tell her I'll come back this evening? Yes?
Because I'm leaving tomorrow. Okay?
Hello?
-You want ten children, don't you? -I want to be a nurse.
But you can't even stand the sight of blood.
I can get used to it. And not all patients bleed.
But as soon as you have your first baby, you'll get your mother's life.
So what do you want to become?
Movie star, writer?
I want…
to see the wide world.
Why don't you come?
Journalists, write down:
We will never become like those boring, predictable mothers.
Shall we dance?
You take the man's part.
And then you whisper in my ear:
"Darling, I have a surprise for you."
And then you drop to your knees and ask me to marry you.
-Where's that ring? -What ring?
The one you put on in class the other day.
I'm saving it for my real true love. Don't be such a spoilsport. I am your true love.
Don't be such a spoilsport. I am your true love.
True love is forever, and only if you've known real true love,
only then can you truly be happy.
Hello?
-Is anyone there? -Yes, said the thief, here I am.
Wasn't it empty before?
Yes.
A sewing machine?
From Mutti.
What's it doing here?
Maybe it's broken or something.
Our breakfast photo.
-What's that? -For making jam.
And Dad suddenly has a tenant, Mr…
Goldschmidt or something.
So now I have to share a room with Margot. Really, so stifling.
Margot was looking for this the other day.
-Beautiful, isn't it? -Yes.
Hocus-pocus…
And…
Learned it from Margot.
-I would like to feel real ones. -Anne, get a grip.
You get a grip, Hanneli. You're also going to grow breasts.
Hanneli? Come here.
Hanneli, look.
-Anne, put that book away. -That's what women look like inside.
Look, Hannah.
Look, Hannah, what is this?
-Anne. -What is this?
-So big, look. -I don't like it.
-You want to be a nurse, don't you? -That's different.
Do your patients keep their clothes on?
-Just look, Hannah. -I don't like it.
-Look. -I don't like it.
Look. Look, look, look.
Look. Look, look, look. Stop. Stop. Stop.
Stop. Stop. Stop.
Just stop. I said stop, so why don't you stop?
Gee. I hate you.
Hanneli, come back.
-Go on, outside. -The coats, the coats.
Get in. Now…
Hurry up.
-Hey. -My suitcase.
You too.
Go on.
-Get on. -Here. You too, get on.
Hey, come back you.
Filthy Jewess.
Dad, the people across the street…
They won't come for us. They're not allowed to, Mother's pregnant.
No fear, sweetheart.
I have papers.
Mutti needs you.
Mom…
-Mom, the people across the street… -Yes, darling.
We must have faith.
-Mom, may I ask something? -Of course, sweetheart.
How did the baby get into your belly?
Our dear God, my sweetheart, decides our fate.
-Anne says God has nothing to do with it. -God knows everything.
-Anne says God has nothing to do with it. -God knows everything. -But Anne knows everything better. -Anne is stupid.
-But Anne knows everything better. -Anne is stupid.
-Did you have an argument? -Stupid cow.
She, or you?
I hate her.
Not really, but…
I've never seen you otherwise than together.
Always together.
Everyone may go to the air-raid shelter. Except for us.
-You have an appointment with Anne? -I don't need an appointment. Do you?
-Is it true? -What?
-That you don't dare to French kiss. -I can French kiss like the best.
-Hello, Mr… Goldschmidt? -Goudsmit.
Actually I come for Anne.
No hurry, they're gone.
-Have they been taken away? -They've gone to family in Switzerland.
Really? But I was supposed to come too.
-Oh, have they forgotten you as well? -No, Moortje will stay somewhere else.
But Anne can't do without Moor.
Mr. Goudsmit? Is there a letter for me?
-No. -And for me?
But I was supposed to come too. Skiing in real snow.
And why didn't she take her winter coat?
Because she doesn't tell you everything.
Hey, Anne's diary is gone.
Look here.
Little nurse.
What do you know about that?
It's so mean.
They've gone to Switzerland.
They've left without me.
She'd promised.
Oh, my darling. I'm sure Anne will write you a letter when she arrives.
But she promised, Mutti. I shouldn't have walked off in anger yesterday.
You shouldn't have gone out at all.
But she's my best friend.
Darling, everything will be fine. Just have faith in your friendship.
-Are you her best friend or not? -Have faith in God.
-Are you her best friend or not? -Have faith in God. Only He knows our fate.
For your mother.
Mutti, I'm going to write to Anne. What's the address?
Five minutes to pack your suitcase. Dad?
Open up.
Dad.
-Open up, now. -Hannah, open the door. Quick, before they kick it down.
Hans. Hans.
-Pack your suitcase. Five minutes. -Sir…
Sir, listen…
So, good little girl.
-What's your name? -Hannah Goslar.
-What's your name? -Hannah Goslar. That's a beautiful German name.
Have your daddy and mommy hidden anything here?
Please, sir, I have a letter.
Dad, shouldn't you tell him about your jaundice?
My wife is heavily pregnant. We can't travel.
Let's go. Come, she's really pregnant.
Dad, what do you see?
Nothing.
-Will they come back for us? -No.
We're on a list. When we have passports, we can leave.
-Yes, and then I'll go to Switzerland. -No, we're staying together.
-Get the doctor. -We can't.
Hannah, I have to stay with Gabi and Mutti. You go and get a doctor, okay?
Hannah, I have to stay with Gabi and Mutti. You go and get a doctor, okay? -That's not allowed. -We need a doctor here, you understand?
-That's not allowed. -We need a doctor here, you understand?
The night is the same as the day. Only turn the light on if it's really necessary.
Give it here.
Give it here. Arm.
Okay.
Go, quick. Hannah, quick, please.
Go away, it's a razzia.
The bridge, Dad…
The Germans, they…
I wrote two letters today.
One to Mommy in heaven, and one to Anne in Switzerland.
I miss Mom. And I miss Anne.
Open up. All Jews outside. Open up.
Open up. Open up, now.
Jews, outside.
Hello?
Anne.
Anne.
-Anne. -Hanneli?
Hanneli, is that you?
Anne?
Hanneli?
-What are you doing here? -I thought you…
What are you doing here?
-I thought you were in Switzerland. -No, in the annex.
You were supposed to come too, but with Gabi and the new baby it was impossible.
How is the baby? Do you have a little brother or a sister?
Hanneli? Hanneli, are you still there?
Margot and I are here by ourselves.
-I have to go. -Wait. I've missed you so.
-God will help us. -Wait, wait.
But when is he going to do so? Listen, Margot and I are very ill and…
Listen, Margot and I are very ill and…
We haven't had anything to eat for days, Hannah. Nor to drink.
They say that we'll be transferred…
Do you have food? Can you please bring us some food?
-I have to go now. -We're so terribly hungry.
-I have to go now. -We're so terribly hungry. -Tomorrow, please, Hannah. -But Anne…
-Tomorrow, please, Hannah. -But Anne… Tomorrow, please.
Anne.
Anne. Anne.
Tomorrow we're being exchanged.
What would I do?
-Dahlia, I have to go to my father, now. -You wait. They come for you. You pack.
That is for you. All of it.
If you bring me to my daddy. I have to go to my father, now.
-You wait. -No.
Here. If you take me to my daddy.
I have to go to my father.
-You pack. -I will empty them all.
I have to go to my father.
This is all I have.
I have to go to my father, now.
Do you know what she says? She says: you crazy.
You pack for exchange. If I go, I also crazy.
You believe I crazy?
-Halt. Halt. -Please, she's sick.
Pretty lady.
Tomorrow evening, big party.
You have to come too.
Open the gate. Let her through.
Out of the way, out of the way, quick. Quick, bring him over there.
What happened? Bring him to the back, fast.
Dad, listen. Anne is in the camp next to ours.
-She and Margot… -What are you doing here?
I have to bring them food tonight, okay? Can't we stay?
Oh no.
We only get this chance once. We have to leave today.
We'll soon get liberated.
-Says who? -Anne. We'll soon get liberated.
-No one knows what the future will bring. -But Anne and Margot…
-May God forbid! -I'm not going.
-Hanneli, please. -I'm going to Anne.
-You don't talk back to your father. -Yes, I am talking back to you now.
-I'm not coming. I'm going to Anne. -Don't be a stupid girl.
Come along.
Gabi, you're staying with Daddy, okay? Stay with Daddy, okay?
You'll be leaving soon.
You'll be leaving soon.
Anne is my best friend.
Come on, inside. Faster.
-Give up. -No.
-Package. Give. -No.
-Give. -No.
Food only for the weak.
-No, it's for Anne. -Anne? Who Anne? What Anne?
Anne is the weakest of all. And I'm going to bring her food tonight.
No, you leave today, with father and Gabi. Exchange.
No. I want to bring Anne food.
No, you danger for us, for all women.
I won't abandon Anne. I can't. Not anymore.
She's my best friend. I have to go.
Later will be too late.
I say you're going to save best friend.
And what did she say?
Go, Hannah, go to friend.
-Anne? -Hallo?
-Where's Anne? -I'm here.
-Hanneli? -Anne.
Hannah, quick.
-I'm here. -I did it. Here it is.
Anne…
No, don't…
-Hanneli… -I have to go.
She pushed me away and won't give it back.
-I have to go. -Can you come back again tomorrow?
Hold on, Anne, hold on.
Hannah, come along.
Quick.
He was too weak to travel. But he insisted on seeing you.
He was too weak.
Dad, I'm here.
Dad?
-Wake up. -Gabi, Daddy is very tired.
Daddy's going back to sleep.
Say "bye, Daddy".
Say "sleep well, Daddy".
Anne?
Fritz. Fritz, my darling.
Dance with me.
You here, in the middle of the night? Wonderful.
Ugly as ever.
Where are your breasts? Those aren't even tea bags.
Anne?
-Hanneli? Hanneli, you're here. -Anne.
Anne, I can see you.
Hey, Hannah Elisabeth.
Hey, Anne Frank.
-And my hair? -Looking good.
We'll soon get liberated.
Are you still going to travel the world?
Yes.
-Will you still be a nurse? -What do you think?
I think…
I think that you should do what makes you happy. So if that is…
-becoming a nurse, then… -I'm coming with you.
Your ring.
Cheers.
For you. From me.
I never want to leave here.
Yes, first to Hollywood, I think.
What if we find nothing there but movie stars?
Then we'll just go somewhere else. To Paris.
-No, we'll go much further. -India. Or China.
China?
Shortly after Hannah's meeting with Anne, the Nazis went on the run. Everyone who could walk, had to come.
Everyone who could walk, had to come.
Hannah never saw Anne again.
Anne and Margot passed away shortly before the camp was liberated.
Hannah became a nurse in Palestine.
But in her thoughts she still travels the world every day. With Anne…
They promised each other to look at the Little Dipper every night.
Hannah still does.
Hannah and Gabi had 7 children,
38 grandchildren and 27 great-grandchildren.
They call that their revenge on Hitler.
Anne became what she wanted: world-famous.
And Hannah knows that for a while they were genuinely happy.
To Hannah, Anne always remained her best friend.
Anne and Margot went into hiding in the Annex on 6 July 1942 and were discovered on 4 August 1944.

Where are you, little rat?
Ferry!
Hey, asshole!
Come here.
Ferry?
Come to your father.
If you've got such a big mouth, why are you hiding?
Jack.
-Please come back inside. -Shut your face.
-Jack. -Fer.
-You'll wake everyone up. -Come.
Come back inside. You're right. It's my fault.
Get your paws off me!
Claudia, look, I've got it. He can't hurt her.
Put it away, it's dangerous.
Hey! Jack!
You're not right at all. You're a pathetic drunk bastard.
I don't want anything to do with you. Ungrateful whore!
Destroy her!
No. Stop!
-Ferry. -Let her go!
Fer. Put that down, boy.
Are you going to shoot your own father?
-Let her go! -Fer.
Ferry, come back.
What are you going to do? Fer, boy.
And now? What will you do now?
Jack, stop. Shoot, tough guy.
-Jack! -Shoot, then!
-If you don't shoot, I will. -Jack, stop!
Jack, don't.
Jack! Look at me! Stop!
Never threaten someone if you can't go through with it.
Loser.
On the Amsterdam canals
I have pledged my heart forever
Amsterdam fills my mind
As the most beautiful city in our country
Welcome to Amsterdam.
One of the finest cities in the world and a paradise for culture lovers.
Amsterdam never sleeps and has something for everyone.
Strip clubs, cafés, coffee shops.
My boss Brink has it all. He is the emperor of the nightlife.
Brink is as rich as the sea is deep, but has always remained an ordinary boy.
A warm, common man who takes care of the people he loves.
Good afternoon.
Well, how do you like that?
I'm drunk and he looks like Brad Pitt.
But if you cheat him, you've got a problem.
And I'm the man who solves the problems.
I'll be back tomorrow and you'll have the money, okay? Okay.
No!
I'll do anything for Brink.
He took me in when I was worthless.
He is my mentor.
That applies to all of us. Olaf, Robert, Rico, and Brinks' son, Mattijs.
We are a family, a tight club.
We work hard, we party hard.
All the people of Amsterdam
Brink takes care of us and we look after each other.
I take who I want, what I want, and how much I want.
Than to be from Amsterdam
I am the happiest man in the world.
Yo.
Hey.
-Ali. -Baba.
Brink. Ferry.
Hey, hands off.
Tasty. You could become a real kebab master.
We're missing Koeman.
What are you on about? He hasn't played in ages.
Well, with Koeman, we'd have been champions.
Are you serious? You should have become a pundit.
-So, welfare princes. How's it going? -Just in time, gents. The game's starting.
Here. How's it going here?
-I didn't know you were coming. -Just checking how it's going.
-Well, it's going well. -Really?
I heard that the Maroc is gone. -Yes, it sells really well. -Yes.
Didn't I ask you to stock up?
I did, and it's gone again.
Let me handle my business and you handle yours.
I've got it all under control here. So just back off.
Dad, come on. What do you mean, come on?
Do you know who we just saw?
Etienne, that good friend of yours.
Still hasn't paid, huh?
You're letting yourself get cheated. It's bad!
-Brink. -For us all.
Ferry and I took care of it for you, so just take that as an example.
Otherwise you'll be crying for money again.
Dad.
Get some beers. The game's starting. Come on.
The match is kicking off. It's important for Ajax.
Open. Open up now.
-Hands on your head! -Hands up!
No messing around. If you move, you're dead!
No messing around. If you move, you're dead! Run to the back.
Hands on your head!
Fill up the bag. Now. Hurry up.
Hurry up!
Hey!
Keep filling it up. Keep going.
Now! Hurry up. Come on, man.
Keep going.
Hey, what are you doing? Fucking idiot!
-Do you want to die? -What's happening?
-What's happening? -Dad.
Hey, move it!
Keep filling it up!
-Dad, don't do it. -Almost done?
Hey, almost done?
He's too late. A number of defenders looking at each other,
-but Suarez times it so well… -Who are you?
Fuck!
Goddamn it!
Ferry?
This isn't good.
Ferry, this isn't good.
Go get the car!
-We're nearly there. -Hold on, boy. Come on, hold on.
EMERGENCY
Gunshot wound to the thorax. Take him straight to the operating room.
-Guys, pulse. -Start.
He's lost a lot of blood.
Here's the operating table.
-You can't come any further. -What?
Brakes on. We lift on three.
One, two, three. -Okay. -Come on.
-What is the tension? -Blood pressure is too low.
I wanted to toughen him up as a kid so he could take better care of himself.
If he got beaten up at school,
he'd get a few knocks from me too, to make him stronger.
He was always different.
And I haven't been able to protect him.
I wasn't paying attention.
I should never have let them in. It's my fault.
No. It's not your fault.
They knew where to go. They knew.
They waited for that match.
This is no coincidence, Fer.
Southerners. They were from the south.
Yeah, they very well could be.
You know that area.
You know people there.
I haven't been there in ages. That's not for nothing.
I want you to find out who did this.
And I want you to shoot them.
If you move, you're dead!
Hands up!
If you move, you're dead!
Who is that? I don't know. Go and check.
I don't know. Go and check.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
-I've come to visit. -Visit who?
John and my sister.
I've never seen you before. Were you in jail?
Only idiots go to jail.
-Oh, yeah? -Yeah.
-My father's in jail. -Wesley!
-I'll puncture your tires, moron. -Scram.
John.
It's been a while.
Did you dye your hair?
-Claudia is inside. -I came for you.
House X was robbed. -They shot Mattijs. It's not looking good. -Shit.
-They shot Mattijs. It's not looking good. -Shit.
-Can we talk? -Why the fuck are you here?
Sister.
I was in the area.
For business.
-I thought I'd stop for a coffee. -Just one cup.
Well, come inside.
No shoes on my carpet.
Nothing's changed.
Wait, honey.
Yes.
-Honey, can you make some coffee? -Fine.
Did you fall?
Sort of, yes.
Camp's looking good.
So, what's your news?
-What? -You don't just drop by.
How long have John and I been married? About four or five years? So?
-You finally came to say sorry. -Can we just sit in peace?
No. I can't look at your face if you don't say sorry.
-Why must I say sorry and not you? -I don't have time for this.
-John, help me up. -Claudia…
-Help me the fuck up! -Fer just got here.
Let her go and then we'll talk.
No, you know what?
I'm staying here. You get up.
Jesus, the Clau hasn't changed one bit.
-Fuck off, you hairball. -Just keep quiet for a second.
See him showing off with his fake blond hair. -You make me sick! -Fuck off, hysterical windbag!
-You make me sick! -Fuck off, hysterical windbag!
Here, this is what I think of you, ugly baboon!
-Always so difficult! -Me, difficult?
-Yes! -Dirty piss stain.
That's mature. Can't you shut your trap for five seconds?
Drop dead, man.
Sweetheart, calm down. Stay calm.
Clear off, Fer. Get out. Scram.
Scram!
It's okay, I'm here.
-Here. -Yes.
What's going on?
She's sick, Fer.
There's a tumor in her head. A big one.
What?
It causes her to have severe mood swings.
Tantrums like that. Paralysis in her leg.
They tried to remove it, but they couldn't.
So?
They gave her a couple more months.
Can I go to her?
Leave it. She's resting now.
-What can I do for you? -Well…
Brink wants me to find those guys.
They were campers. Southerners, I think.
Three men. Two robbers and a driver.
I've been out for a while, Fer. I promised your sister.
I know, but you've been around for a while. You might hear something.
I have a photo of one of them. You may have seen him before.
What?
That's Jason, John Kant's son. A real bastard.
Where does he live?
He fled to a campsite in Belgium last year.
Which campsite?
Zonnedauw.
Sorry, I'm looking for Jason Kant.
Jason Kant?
Do you know Jason Kant? -No. -No?
Thank you. Jason Kant, boys?
No, we don't know him.
Sorry, do you know Jason Kant?
Yes, I think he lives there in the chalet with the American flag.
-Over there? -Yes.
-Thank you. -Sure.
Misha?
Misha?
Misha, girl?
Time to eat.
Misha?
Shit.
Misha?
Misha?
Misha?
Misha?
Misha?
Oh, there you are.
You know you're not allowed outside. Come here.
You're not allowed to go outside. No, it's not allowed.
Come here. Give me a kiss.
Eat up.
Bye, honey. Bye-bye.
Is that good, Misha?
Damn cat.
Mom, you know I can't go that fast with my knees.
-Hello. -Are you doing that on purpose or what?
You're Mr…
Ferry.
Mr. Ferry. Yes.
-Are you the owner? -Yes, for 20 years now.
I'm Filip.
-Nice location. -I know what you're up to, pervert.
Mom, this isn't Eddy. This is a new guy.
Yes, sorry, we had some trouble with the previous tenant.
They made weird movies here, but that's all been cleaned up.
But it wasn't nice. It wasn't…
Allez. Give me the key, Mom!
Allez. The key.
Hey…
Crazy bitch.
Voilà.
Entrez.
Relax, okay? Good.
As you can see, it's not big, but it has all the modern comforts.
There's a fridge, a fire, and if it gets too hot, you can rent a fan from us.
and if it gets too hot, you can rent a fan from us. How much is it?
Two hundred per week.
-Cash? -What else?
Wow.
Okay, thank you. Oh, yes, the supermarket closes in an hour.
And if you want to go outside to soak up some culture,
the fair is on in the town center.
Yes, I know it's not much, but it's something, isn't it?
So, I'll put the key here.
That's a good place, so you don't lose it.
Allez, bye, okay? Mom, turn around. We're off.
Yes?
Yes, it's me. How's it going?
His blood levels are going up, but I don't know what that means.
Going up is good, right? Yeah, sure.
Yes. And you?
Yeah, I found one of the guys at a campsite in Belgium.
I'm sitting in a smelly caravan, waiting for him to get home.
-Oh, that's fast. -Yes.
John helped.
Hang in there. You too.
Just listen for a moment! -Let me go! -Just two minutes. Come on!
-Let me go! -Just two minutes. Come on! Beer, cut it out!
Get your hands off me. I'm not in the mood.
It's full of cops here. I'll call one.
You're hurting me!
-Hey! -Mind your own business, okay?
Is he bothering you?
Yes, he's bothering me.
Let go.
I'll ask nicely once, okay?
Keep your hands off her or I'll break all your bones.
Do you understand?
And now, fuck off. Loser.
Get lost.
Cunt.
Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.
What kind of loser is that?
My stalker.
My ex.
Or we're back together. I don't know. It's confusing.
-Fuck, what a mess. -I'll help.
No, you really don't have to. You've done more than enough.
-You can't sell these now. -No, they're trash.
It's kind of you, thanks.
I'm Danielle, by the way. -Ferry. -Hi.
-Ferry. -Hi.
Oh, man, I'm really shaking all over.
Haven't I seen you before?
-I don't know. -Camping Zonnedauw?
-That's where I live. -Yes?
-I'm renting a caravan there. -What a coincidence.
Don't you live in the chalet with the American flag?
No. -Oh, I saw you come out of there. -No, I clean there. That's my neighbor's.
-Oh, I saw you come out of there. -No, I clean there. That's my neighbor's.
I've never seen anyone else there.
No, he's often at his girlfriend's.
Will he stay there long?
Are you his girlfriend?
Sorry, I'm asking too much.
I'm just trying to get to know the neighborhood. I live alone.
I'm just trying to get to know the neighborhood. I live alone. -Where are you from? -Amsterdam.
-Where are you from? -Amsterdam. You don't sound like it at all.
No, I'm originally from Brabant.
And why are you here again?
My sister.
She's sick.
Cancer.
That's bad.
Sorry, can I offer you a drink or…
a joint?
I have to go. I've got to get up early tomorrow.
Okay.
Well, maybe I'll see you at the campsite.
See you around. Bye.
HEY SIS, HOW ARE YOU?
What are you doing here?
Come on, then.
Master's not home, right?
Shakira, come here. Come.
-Hey. -Hey.
-Morning. -Morning.
-Sorry, did I wake you? -I've been up for a while.
-Why are you here? -I heard a noise at the neighbor's.
I saw a door open. I think there was a burglary.
-No! -Maybe we should check it out
and give that boy a call. Yes, wait a minute. I'll put her in the bedroom.
Yes, wait a minute. I'll put her in the bedroom.
Sorry, she's so young, I don't want her sneaking out.
Okay, here I am.
-Are you always up so early? -No.
I was woken up by…
the silence, I think.
That's weird.
Oh, no, Misha. Well, she's gone.
Fuck.
How awful.
Shit.
Ah, fuck. No, don't touch anything!
Don't leave your fingerprints.
Fingerprints? -Yes, for the cops. -The cops?
-Yes, for the cops. -The cops?
Shouldn't you just call that boy, what's his name?
Call Jason? Yes, do you think?
-It's his house. -Yeah.
How did you know his name is Jason?
You said that.
Yesterday.
Hey, it's me.
Yes, sorry.
Yes, it's really important. There's been a burglary.
-Where? -Your place.
Hey? When?
I don't know. The door was open. Everything's upside down.
-Goddamn it. -Tell him to come here.
I think it's best if you come see for yourself.
-I'll be right there. -Okay.
-Don't touch anything. -Okay.
Is he coming? What an asshole.
-Is he coming? -Yes.
-I can never do anything right for him. -Then why do you work for him?
Yeah, I need the money.
You don't do stuff like this. It's awful.
You must think it's always like this here.
That stuff yesterday, and now this.
It's not so bad.
Yeah, normally it's nice and quiet here.
Cozy. A holiday all year round, you could say.
Shall I give you a tour? -How about this afternoon? -I can't.
-How about this afternoon? -I can't.
-Okay. -I have to see my sister.
Okay. Bye.
You robbed the wrong house.
Drive.
Fuck.
Where are we going?
You can stop over there on the left.
How did you know where we were?
-We were hired. -By who?
I don't know.
Are you fond of your balls?
I really don't know.
-My buddy organized everything. -Who's your buddy?
Get lost, man.
Get out.
We'll play a game. It's called one in six.
Fucking madman.
Hey!
Goddamn it.
Fuck!
Goddamn it.
What are you doing, man?
Who are your friends?
Who are your friends? Hey.
Who are your friends? Fuck you!
Stop screaming. Who are the other two?
Fuck you! -That's it? -Yes!
-That's it? -Yes!
-That's it?! -Yes!
Brink sends his regards.
Piss stain.
INBOX
I don't think about you in the shower. Leave me alone.
Yo bro, sick shit today. Everything good?
What time are we leaving for Amsterdam?
Hey.
Jesus, look at you.
What happened?
I fell. Fell? From a mountain or what?
-That needs disinfecting. -I'll do it later.
No, Ferry, otherwise it'll get infected. You'll get staphylococcus.
-Your hair will fall out. -Really?
Yes, for real.
We have to do something about that.
Come with me. You helped me, now I want to do something for you.
Did you rob a pharmacy or something?
I don't like pain.
Maybe you should take your shirt off. With all those scrapes.
Oh, gosh.
Okay, I'll try to be very careful.
Yeah, sorry.
How was your sister?
Fine.
Is that where you fell?
You're not that close, are you?
What do you mean?
When I mention her, you get all tense.
We're not that close, no.
Has it always been like that?
People change.
Well that's nice, right?
That despite everything, you're there for her. That's what matters most.
I think that's okay now.
I'll grab a shirt so you don't have to go out like that.
I bought it for Berend, but he didn't like it.
Well, you can have it.
I have something for the pain and cramps. It's made from hazelnuts.
I have something for the pain and cramps. It's made from hazelnuts. Where did I put it?
Yes, here.
It was buy two, get one free.
So you can give that to your sister. Maybe it'll help.
Thank you. My pleasure.
I'd love to chat, but Shakira hasn't done her poop yet
and I have to open the stall at four.
Okay.
Sweetie, come.
Come on.
Tonight's the last night of the fair.
If you want to do something fun with your sister.
There will be fireworks. It'll be a party.
And I'll give you free cotton candy, okay?
Well, see how you feel. You know where I'll be.
-See you. -Bye.
Thank you.
Brink. Hey, Fer. How's it going?
Jason has been dealt with. I think I know how to get the second one.
And you? Mattijs is in a coma at the moment.
I slept by his bed last night. Things are still uncertain.
It's open.
-Oh, it's you. -Clau.
Shoes.
Sorry.
How's it going?
I didn't know you smoked.
I started two months ago. What does it matter?
Next week I'll move on to crack and heroin.
Sorry.
About your thing.
About my thing?
That you're sick.
We're not talking about it.
I have something for you.
It's supposed to help with muscle pain. I mean it. I'm not pathetic.
I simply brought something for you.
It's the way you look at me.
What's that?
Some homeopathic nonsense?
Thank you.
Where's John?
At the shop.
When will he be back?
Oh, it's like that.
-What? -That's why you're here.
Hey, what?
-I brought something for you, didn't I? -You do everything for yourself.
Fuck off, man. I don't know why I still make an effort.
-An effort? -Yes, an effort!
-You clearly don't like me! -You stay away for five years,
-You clearly don't like me! -You stay away for five years, and then you think everything's suddenly okay again?
and then you think everything's suddenly okay again?
So it's my fault you didn't tell me you have cancer.
You know what? I'm out of here. We'll see each other again in ten years.
-Don't bother, I'll be dead anyway! -Well, then good riddance!
Goddamn it.
Cunt!
Hey, Fer.
-Everything okay? -Great.
And that wife of yours too.
You leaving again?
Don't you ever check your phone?
I have a question.
Know any cops who want to earn a bit extra?
Well, I might know a guy who knows a guy.
I have the phone number from a certain Davy.
I want to know where he is.
Phone number? That'll cost you.
Phone number? That'll cost you. It doesn't matter. Brink's paying.
-I'll see what I can do. -Great.
Nice shirt.
Neighbor.
Hey, you came.
And on your own.
Yes.
Yeah, my sister wasn't feeling so well, so…
Well, that's a shame.
On another note, you work here and I guess you sometimes see things.
And there's a big party tonight,
and people may want to go a little crazy,
so they take something, right?
You know what I mean.
Drugs.
You don't have to come to the fair for that.
What are you looking for?
White.
Well, neighbor, we're getting to know each other now.
And just for you?
Hard day, I guess.
-You're not much of a talker, are you? -No.
So, you want to blow off steam.
Is it always coke?
Yes.
Shall I tell you a secret?
Sometimes you have to take a vacation in your own head.
Ecstasy?
Do you always carry it?
Well, I'm off tomorrow. I'm done here.
We can share.
Neighbor…
You're full of surprises.
Just like these pills.
Full of surprises, peace, and love.
So, you can choose. If you want coke, then I can arrange something.
Or you can join me on a nice vacation.
This really is the best pill you've ever had. I swear.
Oh, exciting. Now we wait till it works.
And is it starting to kick in?
Your sister wasn't doing so well?
-Do we have to talk about that now? -No, not if you don't want to.
We can only talk for five minutes, and then we get in each other's hair.
Oh, no, I didn't mean that.
You said she wasn't feeling well?
-Oh, you had a fight. -For five years now.
-No. -Yes.
Five years?
Tell me.
She got married to a friend of mine, and according to our family traditions,
we honor the dead by having a drink at their graves.
And my mom and dad have been dead for years.
Oh, how terrible. Not at all, no.
Yes, my mother, but not my father. He was an asshole.
Yes, my mother, but not my father. He was an asshole. Shame.
I'd already lived in Amsterdam for a few years, so I never came home.
What do you do in Amsterdam?
Business. Mysterious.
So, after the service, we went to the grave.
Suddenly, I see that my father's name had been carved into it.
Claudia had just added my father to it.
-No. -Yeah, and I was furious.
My father belonged in the dump. -And then? -Well, then I made a fuss.
-And then? -Well, then I made a fuss.
I started a fight, and she threw me out.
Maybe I am an asshole. No.
You're not an asshole. I've seen what you're like.
Anyone who stands up for a woman they don't know is no asshole.
is no asshole. Believe me, no asshole.
And I really love her too.
That's so important. Me too. I love my brother so much.
I have a brother. Did I mention I have a brother?
Do you have a brother? You didn't say, no.
Did you say that? I don't know.
-I'm talking a lot. -It's starting to work, isn't it?
Yes. It's starting to work.
-Nice, right? -Yeah, groovy pills.
Hey.
Did I snore too loud?
When I drink, I start snoring. Awkward.
-I didn't hear anything. -That's lucky.
Oh, shit. I should have laid off those nasty shots.
-I told you, didn't I? -Yes, I know.
Fuck, she has to pee.
Oh, no. Bad idea.
Can you go outside for a moment?
I don't know how to do that. Just down the street here.
Otherwise she'll keep barking and my head is already about to explode.
Please.
Don't look at me like that.
-You're a sweetheart. -Yeah.
The poop bags are under the sink.
The poop bags are under the sink.
Hey, hurry up.
-Yeah. -It's me.
I have Davy's address. I'll text you.
Okay, thank you.
Come on.
Hey.
-Come here and I'll let you free. -Hey, sweetie.
Come here.
Hey, sweetie. Hello.
Hello. Hi.
And are you okay?
Well, I just threw up twice.
Eat some eggs. Good for your liver.
I really can't think about food right now. And you?
Would you like breakfast here?
I have to go.
Okay.
Yeah, I had a really great time last night.
Me too.
See you later?
See you later.
Yeah, I'd like to kiss you, but I just threw up.
You're a weird one.
Yes?
Package for Davy Mols.
Leave it at the door. I'll get it later.
No, I can't do that.
I need a signature.
Who are you working for? Who do you think?
It was one of your own men.
Who?
Mattijs.
You're lying. He was in trouble. He needed money.
He was in trouble. He needed money. His dad cut him off.
It's true.
-Then why was he shot? -An accident. I swear.
I saw a gun and I fired.
Who was the third? A dude from the campsite.
-One of Jason's guys. -Name.
Lars.
Lars van Marken.
Please, bro. I don't want to--
Yo.
He's dead.
Fer…
Mattijs is dead. What?
It started to make a noise, to beep.
They tried everything.
Did you find the second one? Yeah.
Taken care of.
And do you know who the third is?
Yes.
Lars van Marken.
Make him suffer.
Come in.
-How was it? -Yeah…
Let's not talk about it. Oh, really? That kind of a day?
-How are you? -Yeah, much better.
I laid down for a while and showered. I'm a whole new person.
I'm going to make sandwiches and chill in front of the TV with a joint.
-Would you like to join me? -Yes.
Okay, go sit down then.
-Beer? -Yes.
-Here you go, honey. -Thanks.
I would love to go to Amsterdam sometime.
Then we should do that.
I don't know, it just never happens.
Yeah, I recently saw something about the the Skinny Bridge in a magazine.
-It's supposed to be nice. Do you know it? -It's very beautiful.
Personally, I always stay in the center.
There's a bench there. Then I get a sandwich and a beer.
Just sit there and be left alone.
-What? -Nice.
I see who you are.
Underneath that tough exterior is a gentle heart.
Hi.
-Hey. -Oh, hello. Hey.
Sorry to interrupt.
I've come to drop off those eggs, and I have a surprise.
For me? Oh, from the petting zoo!
So good, that rice pudding. You're a sweetheart, little brother.
Jesus, you sounded hungover on the phone, but when I see your face…
Fer, this is my brother.
Yes, I can see that.
-Hello. -Hey.
-Heard a lot about you. -Good things?
-No, of course not. -Luckily.
-Ferry. -Ferry.
I haven't heard anything about you.
Yes, kidding.
I'm Lars.
-Lars? -Yeah.
People think I was named after Lars Ulrich, but he was only ten then.
Fer.
This is so good, you have to try it. What? No.
-Is something wrong? -No.
-Put the eggs in the fridge. -Yes.
But in this weather…
So, Ferry, you just moved here?
For good or…? No.
He's here for his sick sister.
Yes, he came back here especially from Amsterdam.
That's really sweet. Amsterdam?
-How long have you been here? -A few days.
What must he think of us?
Berend was looking for a fight, Jason's chalet was broken into.
Yeah. What a coincidence.
-And you discovered that? -Yes.
-And you discovered that? -Yes. I heard a noise and went to have a look.
Have you heard from Jason?
I called him to tell him.
No, after that. No, he's probably at his girlfriend's. I don't know.
No, he's probably at his girlfriend's. I don't know.
I need him, but he's not answering.
Maybe that's a good thing. You know what I think.
Have you seen Jason, Ferry?
How long are you staying?
It depends on how things go.
-What's your line of business? -Lars, don't interrogate him.
Can't I ask about his work?
He always does this with new friends.
-Catering. -Is that enough, Lars?
-Can we have fun again? -I have to go.
Hey, come on now.
Yeah, no, I really have to go.
I just came to drop those off. I have to go.
-As if you ever have to be anywhere. -Yeah. Bye, Daantje.
Ferry, till next time.
Sure. Yeah, what's up with him suddenly?
-Sorry. -It doesn't matter.
Lars is special, but I don't know what I'd do without him.
I left my wallet at my sister's. I have to go back.
Okay.
Hey, Fer?
We're okay, right?
Dirty bastard.
What were you doing with my sister? -I didn't know she's your sister. -Shut up.
-I didn't know she's your sister. -Shut up.
I'm sorry about your friend. If I'd known, I wouldn't have taken part.
I didn't want any victims.
Never threaten someone if you can't go through with it.
-Please. -Into the woods.
-Please. -Walk.
-Please. -Walk. Please.
Please, I am walking.
Please, I am walking. You have to believe me. You've got it wrong.
I only did it for Daan.
I wanted to help.
-She works herself to death. -Shut up.
-She works herself to death, okay? -Shut up!
I wanted to pay her back. We only have each other, okay?
We only have each other.
I'm sorry.
On your knees.
You have to believe me.
It was a one-off. I haven't even had money from them yet.
I was only the driver.
Hey.
-Are you leaving? -Yeah.
Will you stay at your sister's?
What does it matter? Well, I don't know.
We don't have each other's numbers, do we?
Are you just leaving suddenly?
I'm done here.
And will we still see each other?
We've known each other for two days and we fucked once.
Did you think we were getting married?
How old are you?
Well, I thought we clicked.
Yeah, it was fun.
Bye.
Hey.
Hi, Fer.
Goddamn it.
I'm glad you're back.
Did it work out?
Come on.
Is this your work?
That's number one.
Number two will show up soon.
And the last one, Van Marken?
Him too.
Lived at the campsite. Out of sight. No prying eyes.
I followed him into the woods and shot him there.
Easy-peasy.
Of course, that won't bring Mattijs back.
He was a neurotic, we all know that.
But yeah…
Yeah, he was also a good kid.
Do you know who ratted us out?
No.
They said they'd been watching us for a while. They followed the couriers.
We have to change the system.
-Be more careful. -That's taken care of.
I wanted to be safe rather than sorry.
Okay.
Well done.
Rico handled the business while you were gone.
So…
Let's drink.
Hey, man.
Thank you.
Do you always call this late? Hey.
Hey, Ferry.
Clau, I…
wanted to say something.
I wanted to say sorry for what happened at your wedding.
It's okay.
How's it going?
I'm dying.
But I had a good day. Not much pain.
That stuff you gave me does help.
John and I biked a bit.
We ate some steak. It was good.
That's nice.
That's nice.
If I'm grateful for something, it's that I got to know John through you.
Without him, it wouldn't have meant a thing.
Okay.
Are you back in Amsterdam?
Yeah.
And the business is done?
Could you do what you had to do?
Yes.
Okay.
Goodnight, then.
Goodnight, sis.
I love my brother so much.
I was just the driver.
Fuck!
Fuck!
My boss can never find out.
If he finds out, he'll burn this place down.
I'll keep quiet. I swear.
Are you going to be late every day?
Your sister…
will never find out about this.
-You'll never have to see me again. -I swear.
Fer, have you left already?
Rico said you were acting strange. Is everything okay?
Ferry, where are you? I'm here alone again. Are you coming?
TWO MONTHS LATER
What now? We have an appointment with those Moroccans.
Sorry, man. I overslept. I'm coming.
Never mind.
Come to the Arena right away.
Well, right on time, dickhead.
Sorry.
-What's happening? -What do you think?
We're done here.
Rico arranged it, for a good price too.
They'll deliver later.
Man, what's up with you?
Nothing.
What do you mean, nothing? You're either cranky, drunk, or too late.
Go home. Take a vacation, take a course.
I don't care, but do something about it. Get yourself together.
You're no use to me like this.
It'll be fine.
-What time later? -Five o'clock. I'll pick you up.
By that bench of yours.
We'll get a Happy Meal.
We want to see cocks
We want to see cocks
We want to see cocks
I'll see you in half an hour.
No, I'll see you in half an hour at the hotel.
-No, don't do that. -You're so boring.
-Bye, have fun. -Thank you.
We want to see cocks
Ferry?
-Hey. -Hey.
-How's it going? -Yeah, good.
-And you? -Yeah.
You're in Amsterdam.
On a hen party. A colleague of mine is getting married.
-Cleaning lady colleague? -No, I work in a hair salon now.
-Do you like Amsterdam? -Yes, it's just great here.
It's really…
-This is a nice spot. -Yes.
I'm glad to see you. Yeah.
And how's your sister? Yeah, fine.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
Yeah, we made up. We call each other a lot.
And she's doing well.
She's showing the doctors a thing or two.
Good for her.
-Sorry. -Man, what a shitty goodbye that was.
Yeah.
Yeah, I thought that was really harsh. I mean…
Maybe I was getting ahead of myself. We'd only just met.
But yeah, for me…
That evening and the way we clicked was really special for me.
So, yeah, I've thought about it a lot.
I liked it too.
But you deserve someone better than me.
Someone who can give you what you need.
-Can I decide that myself? -Hey, dickhead, what's this?
Do you have a girlfriend I don't know about?
Jesus, Rico.
Hello.
Rico is a colleague. We had an appointment.
There's plenty of time. I'm too early.
I'm Rico. I'm his favorite colleague. Who are you?
I'm Danielle.
We're just acquaintances.
Oh, just acquaintances, sure.
I know that. Danielle from the south?
Is it really that obvious? I can't hide it.
I'm here for a hen party with my friends.
Yeah, I thought you don't look like a real nun.
-Sorry, Daan, but we have to go. -Are you embarrassed?
Hey, listen, Daan…
How did you meet?
We know each other from the campsite.
Ferry was taking care of his sick sister and I live there with my brother.
-Well, come on. -Fer, we're staying at the Parklane hotel.
If you fancy a coffee tomorrow, let me know.
The reservation is in my name, Van Marken.
But you can also just text me.
I'm really on the ball again.
Well, have a great time in our beautiful capital, Danielle.
-Thanks. -Come on.
But Fer, you don't have my number.
I'll find you.
Bye.
-Bye. -Yeah.
That all looks good.
Load it up.
Fer, can you help?
-Do it yourself. -I have to make a call.
Yes, that's good. We're coming.
We have to go to Brink.
-Why? -Does it matter?
Gentlemen, it was a pleasure, as always.
Thank you. Till next time.
You coming, dickhead?
-Brink. -Ferry.
What's this?
Sit down.
Just a quick chat to clear some things up
and reassure Rico.
He says you cheated us. I don't think that's possible.
That's not possible. I trust Ferry with my life.
Rico must be wrong.
But we still have some questions about Lars van Marken.
Tell me again
how that went exactly.
Guys, really? Unbelievable.
So…
Davy said Lars is the third man. He lives in a campsite.
I went there, I waited for him.
He ran into the woods, I followed him, and I shot him.
Jason and Davy are in the newspaper, but not Van Marken.
No, it was a big forest.
Maybe they haven't found him yet.
Who was that girl this afternoon?
-Danielle. -Oh, yeah.
That's just a girl from the campsite.
I got bored at night.
Danielle van Marken.
Yes.
I didn't know that.
We didn't do a lot of talking, if you know what I mean.
Is that so?
-Jesus, Brink. -I'm worried about you.
I thought something must have happened in the south that changed him.
But what? You've never been a big talker. We all know that.
And then Rico called and everything fell into place.
Did you lie about Lars?
-No. -You can tell me.
-No. -I won't get mad.
-But I need to know. -I'm not lying.
Do we have to ask that girl?
Leave her out of it.
It's about my son.
I need to know.
You want to know? You really want to know?
Do you want to know the truth?
It was Mattijs.
Mattijs was behind the robbery.
-What are you saying? -Mattijs was behind it.
He was mad at you for not wanting to help him with his mess.
That's bullshit. You said we were followed.
I said that to protect you.
-Shut up, man. That's nonsense. -What if I had said it?
-You're lying. -Your own son robbed you.
I shot two of them. The third one didn't deserve it.
That's the truth.
Why are you doing this, Fer?
Hey?
I love you, man.
And I've already lost a son.
Finish it.
Please.
Do it for me, and this stays between us.
I can't.
If you don't tell us where we can find Van Marken,
then we'll have to ask that girl.
That's not going to happen.
Sorry, then.
Go get that girl.
Don't make it harder than it is, Fer.
Ferry, calm down, man.
Calm down, Fer. We won't let that girl suffer.
-You fucking bitch. -What?
Are we going to cry?
You were like a father to me, man.
I will not be cheated.
What are you going to do without me?
Without me, you're nothing.
Without me, you're a lost, filthy, fucking southerner.
We'll see about that.
No way. Disgusting.
That's so gross.
What happened here?
Mafia settlement, they think. Welcome to Amsterdam.
Maybe there's a cute guy. You could jump on him.
-You can't do that. -Why?
Guys…
Guys, seriously.
-Daan, come on. -Yeah, go ahead.
Hey.
I have coffee if you want it.
No.
I don't even like coffee. I don't know why I said that.
This one is cold anyway.
Daan, sorry.
For everything.
I missed you so much, and I…
Do you want something else?
Chicken soup.
Chicken soup?
Yeah, I've been out all night. I really feel like chicken soup.
Yeah, I've been out all night. I really feel like chicken soup. Then you'll get chicken soup.
-I don't really like Amsterdam. -Neither do I anymore.
Come on. You look great.
Wesley.
Hot chick.
Hey.
Yeah, I need to introduce you to someone.
-Okay. -This is Danielle.
She's my girlfriend.
-Hello. -Hello.
I brought you some cake.
Banana cream pie. -Ferry said it's your favorite. -Yes, that's true.
-Ferry said it's your favorite. -Yes, that's true. Honey, can you make some coffee?
Welcome to the family.
-Thanks. -You fool.
So, asshole, are you staying longer this time?
So, asshole, are you staying longer this time? Sit down, grab a stool.
Honey, let's have some bubbly instead.
It's not allowed, but I drink it every day.
-I've stuck around an extra three months. -Have you tried crack?
Once. I didn't like it at all.
Daan has great pills. We can take them together.
What? Ecstasy.
Yeah. Why not?
-Do you still have them? -They were my brother's.
-Do you still have them? -They were my brother's. Does he still have them?
-He makes them. -Really?
I'll give him a call then.
Hello?
There you are.
So, you can cook.
With my friends.
Hey, guys?
Hey, John-John!
What's up?
-What are you up to? -Nothing. Chilling.
It's hot as hell. Stop jacking off and let's get going.
-Where? -Where do you think? The bay.
-Okay. -Hurry up!
-Yalla. -Yalla.
-Are you coming? -The bay.
-Hey. -Whatever.
All good?
-Hey! -That was a fucking foul, man!
What?
Hey, Sandra! How's it going?
-Fine. You? -Good. You going to the bay?
-No, Trädgården. -Whose garden?
The club, idiot.
-Shut up, Nancy! -Fuck you.
You want to come?
What? Do we look like we're some bums heading to Trädgården?
What? Do we look like we're some bums heading to Trädgården? You do look like a bum. You think they'd let you in?
Sandra, listen. We should do something.
She's got a boyfriend.
-Was I talking to you? --She has a boy, but she needs a man.
She doesn't need one. Not the way you're looking.
Call me, okay?
-Mind your business. -Let's go, girls.
Vanessa was staring at you, bro.
I'm not interested.
Aight.
-Jump! -Let's go, baby!
Shouldn't Yasmin and her gang be here?
I bet there are nice chicks on the other side.
Over there?
If you lived like that, you'd hang out at home.
-You don't know anything. -I've got to get home. This is getting….
-Me too. -Get out of here, both of you.
We were leaving anyway.
-Yalla. -Yalla.
Keep dreaming about those chicks.
How about it?
No.
-Let's go. -No.
It's not even locked. Let's go.
Look!
Damn, those houses are awesome!
-Hi! -Hey!
John-John, I'm telling you. One day, bro, we'll be living over here. One day.
Hey! You want to come for a ride?
-No, thanks. -Is this boat not good enough for you?
-These cribs are crazy. -Damn.
Yo. What is this place?
Good question. Never been here.
-Check it out. -Damn! What an idiot!
Look at that little girl.
Damn!
-What's he…? -There's another one.
Hey, look out! Fuck!
Fuck! Where the fuck did she go?
What are you doing?
Fuck! I'm coming. Take it easy, John-John.
Excuse me. Please, let me through.
Come here, Patricia.
How are you doing? Huh?
-Are you okay? -Yes.
Oh, sweetie.
I wish there were more kids like you.
Then this country wouldn't be going to hell.
Come in.
Wait here, I'll be right back.
Hey, where are you going? Get back here.
A dry sweater. My pants won't fit you, but…
-What's going on? -Patricia was in a swimming accident.
-Is she alright? -Everything's fine. Thanks to you guys.
I'll give you a ride home.
Thanks for the ride, man. And the sweater.
Anytime. -I should be thanking you. -It's cool.
-Take care. -Stay safe.
…then you might get it. Forget the car, I'll get to that. We were on this boat--
-What is he wearing? -He's a hero.
Did he turn into a Swede?
-Listen, do you know what he did? -Hurry up and tell us.
-I'm trying, but you keep interrupting me. -Tell us! Yalla, yalla.
-Shut up! People are trying to sleep. -You shut up!
Shut up, you fucking bum! Get down here!
My God, Frank. This place needs a paint job.
Uh huh.
She says that every year.
Hi, grandma. Hi, Billie.
Hi, sweetie.
A decision I didn't…
Frank says you haven't chosen a school yet, Elisabeth.
Frank says you haven't chosen a school yet, Elisabeth. …deal with it once I've…
Hm?
Absolutely.
The friends you make at school remain your friends throughout life.
They can make or break your future.
-Choose wisely. -Nepotism starts early.
Call it what you like. I've been working for 40 years,
and work is just a small part of the equation.
A small part? So, what's the big part?
Connections?
Yes. I'm sure Elisabeth will find a school that suits her.
Well. Anyway, you won't starve.
-Do you know which school it'll be? -Not yet.
I'll know soon. Sacha says I'll be on some waiting list.
Okay…
For what?
Theater.
What's so funny?
No, what? It's… I was just surprised.
So you like that stuff?
Okay.
And your friends?
Come on!
-What the fuck do you mean? -Don't swear.
-He doesn't care what his friends think. -Do drama if you want. I don't care.
Besides, you have an edge on the other kids.
You'll definitely get in thanks to affirmative action.
Call me later.
So, have you decided what to do this summer?
You don't have to be here all summer, but at least stay a few weeks.
I've been thinking about it.
I've decided to sell this place.
It's too much work.
Huh?
Have I ever complained that it's too much work?
Yes, you have.
Even though we have staff to actually do everything.
Don't be absurd, Frank.
What about Meggy and Kasper?
I think it's the right decision.
We don't need all this.
And that your mother spent all her summers here…
that doesn't mean anything to you?
You didn't care about her when she was alive, why care now?
-Sit down! -Please stop.
-Sit! -Leave her alone!
-Sit down! -Victoria!
Leave her alone. Sit down, so we can talk.
I'd appreciate you not shouting at Elisabeth like that.
-You have no right-- -Yes, I do.
-No! -Okay. Patricia, come, let's go.
You're impossible.
-It's weird your mom's dating The Horse. -The Horse?
Yeah, he was a horse junkie before he did time.
I also heard they beat him up every day in prison.
-Good. -Fucking junkie.
-Hey, where are we going? -The manor.
Are you serious?
-They're probably home! -They're in the country for the weekend.
What?
If you'd listened, you would've heard him say so in the car.
When?
When you were fucking sitting there fantasizing about the sister.
Hey, when we were younger, and people said they'd been to the country… -Yeah? -I thought they meant their home country.
He was nice to us, man.
Hey, JJ, bro…
Seriously, no one who is that rich is nice.
Either he, or one of his relatives, fucked somebody like us over at one point.
Let's go in, take the valuables and leave. No fucking around, okay?
For sure.
Sluggo, chill out.
What is it?
-What if the neighbors see us? -We'll say we're Polish workmen.
Come on, man. I know you want to sniff her panties.
-Whose panties? -Your mom's!
Or you could stay here and keep watch. Your choice.
Come on, guys.
Yalla.
-Do you even know the passcode? -Chill, man.
What did I tell you guys?
Hey, hands up!
-What the fuck are you doing? -Chill, it's not even loaded.
-You crazy? Stop waving it around! -Lower your voice, man.
It's the old man's. How fucked up is that?
Put it back, man.
No way, this is mine now. What are you doing in here?
-Didn't you turn the lights off? -Yes, I think so.
-Sabina's not working tonight? -No.
She got anything?
-No, I've already checked. -I'll follow after you.
Stay in the car.
Guys!
Okay.
This is pretty serious.
Since it wasn't locked away, you could lose your license.
That was very careless of me. I keep it in the weapons safe, but…
…a lot's been going on, so…
-And nothing else was missing? -No.
-Call us if you think of anything. -Of course.
Great.
Carefully.
Let's see.
Well?
No?
Sweetheart…
It's okay.
What are you laughing at?
I knew it!
I got in!
I'm so proud of you.
Hey, Sluggo! Sluggo!
I got in, man!
-Are you kidding me? -No, look.
What did I tell you? Congrats, bro.
Thanks, man.
Only trashy girls have parties these days.
-Yes, I agree! -Did you see Malla?
She tried to invite people in our class. I was like, "Good luck." It was so…
It's going well, man.
-Oh! -You're fucking with me, right?
-Sorry. -Hey, what the fuck?
Sorry!
-Hi. -Hi.
Go, drive!
Thank you.
Congratulations, everybody! You made the cut. That's fantastic.
My name is Jacob.
Most of you met me during your auditions.
Let's introduce ourselves and say why we applied for drama school.
Sorry I'm late.
Let's start with you, Ulla.
Um, hi. My name is Ulla.
My mom is a costume designer, and that's how I got into drama.
And… the ensemble atmosphere was always great.
Well, with a couple of exceptions. Yeah.
John-John?
Hi, my name is John-John, and I want to be an actor.
That's about it.
Great.
Welcome, Elisabeth.
Um…
…my parents don't work in the arts, but I hope that's not a requirement.
Yeah. Anyway, my name is Elisabeth.
I'm looking forward to getting to know everyone.
Sheila?
Hey. Do you recognize me?
-You saved Patricia, right? -Yeah.
-Crazy, huh? What are the odds? -I don't know.
-Do you know each other? -No.
-Did I say something to offend you? -Like what?
You made it sound like I was bragging.
Well, weren't you?
Chill, it was just a joke.
I have to go, but…
…see you later.
What's her problem?
-What? -Well… Never mind.
Don't be fooled by those sandals. He's really strict.
-Is he? -Yeah, ask my sister. She got kicked out.
-What? What did she do? -Nothing. She missed a few classes, so…
That's crazy. I heard he was good.
Yeah everyone says he's great… as long as he likes you.
Well, this is me…
-So… -Oh, sweet.
See you tomorrow.
Hey…
You know Elisabeth, right?
Well… kind of. We have some mutual friends.
Were you about to say something earlier?
Um…
-She, I mean… I think she's a little sad. -Why?
Her mom died recently, a couple of months ago, so…
How was the new class?
I don't know.
Everyone lives in loft apartments in Södermalm with writers for parents.
I see. Are you surprised?
No, I guess not.
Except for one guy. Guess who's in my class.
John-John.
-That John-John? -Yes, that John-John.
Wow.
Can you invite him to my birthday party?
Papa, can he please come to my party?
Don't you need top grades to get in?
-Why wouldn't he have good grades? -No, you're right.
-But please, can he come? -Nah…
We're keeping it small.
So why have you invited all of your employees?
To write off the cost on the company. It's smart.
Yeah, that is smart.
Wait.
-Everything okay? -Mm.
Listen, I…
I've been thinking, and…
If you're strapped for cash or something, just let me know.
I'm good, thanks.
I mean…
-It's better than getting into trouble. -Why would I get into trouble?
I know you're a good guy, but…
-Your friends… -What about them?
"What about them?" They're all going  to end up behind bars sooner or later.
-Thanks for the tip. -You think this is funny?
Let me piss!
Don't disappoint your mom. She works hard for you.
Fucking pretend cop.
Fucking idiot.
-Really, if you think it's too easy-- -Come on Elisabeth, focus.
-What do you want in this scene? -She doesn't seem to want anything.
-Not her, you. What do you want? -I want to do a different scene.
Do you know how many people applied here? No, how many?
I don't need results, but I need you to concentrate.
Okay, let's go again.
-How did you get here…? -Stop! You can sit down.
Sheila.
Elisabeth!
-You forgot your script. -Thanks.
Are you just going to leave me with the vegans?
-You'll be fine. -Are you sure?
I'm sure. See you tomorrow.
Wait…
Uh…
I heard about your mom.
What did you say?
I heard she passed away.
Who told you that?
-It doesn't matter. -Does the entire class know?
-I don't know. -You don't know?
Absolutely.
I hear you.
Give… Next week.
I just have to make a few calls, and then I'll sort this out.
I really am sorry.
That's great. Bye.
I will quit, I promise.
Today we'll be practicing corporal expression.
Why? Because we're putting together a play that we'll perform in the auditorium.
-In front of everyone? -Yes.
And relatives and casting agents.
Don't look so nervous. This is what we do.
It's not drama without an audience, right?
There are two criteria:
It can be half an hour max, and it must be performed without dialogue.
Everyone clear on that?
Hey….
-Sorry about yesterday. -It's fine.
Uh…
I promised Patricia that…
I'd ask if you wanted to come… to her birthday party.
For real?
I don't want to crash your party.
Nah, Papa's work buddies are coming, so there'll be people I don't even know.
Okay.
What's the vibe. Do I need to wear a suit?
No.
Maybe a nice shirt.
Okay, I'll come.
Okay.
Maybe I should give you my number so I can text you details.
-Take a picture so I know who's calling. -How many Elisabeths do you know?
Don't know. Six, seven, eight…
Take a picture.
That's good.
Okay, I have to go, but…
-See you tomorrow. -Okay.
Mom! Do we have wrapping paper?
Is it for me?
Why didn't you ask the store to wrap it?
Do you have a receipt?
Put it back.
Give it back!
Give me it! Stop being annoying.
Are you high?
Is that why you're a dick?
I hear they call you The Horse.
Is it true?
Of course it's true.
You can tell by how you chew your food.
Does my mom know?
Fucking junkie.
What are you doing?
No!
Take it easy! Easy now!
Easy. Sluggo!
Sluggo, help me!
Let go of me, cunt! Let go!
Ow, ow! Okay.
You miserable cunt, get out of here now!
-Take it easy. -Get up. Get out.
Okay.
-Hurry up! -Take it easy.
If I see you here again, I'll kill you.
I'm going, I'm going.
-Are you okay? -Ow.
You alright?
-Hi. -Hi.
Yeah, I know it's a lot.
-Not exactly an intimate family gathering. -No.
You didn't have to bring anything.
It's nothing much.
Patricia is down there.
Hey. I need a drink, but they won't serve me at the bar.
-Can you give it a shot? -Sure.
-Hey! -Hey, you came!
Of course.
-Happy birthday. -Thank you!
-Hi. -Hello.
-How does it feel to be older? -It feels great.
-Nice. Easy on the cliff jumping. -Sure.
That was John-John.
-Hi! -Two glasses, please.
-Of…? -Champagne.
-Champagne, sure. -Thanks.
-Good to see you. -Did you say hi to Patricia?
So you got into Stockholm School of Economics? Congratulations.
Thank you.
I have to say hi.
I heard that you were Patricia's hero. Karl.
-John-John. -Have a seat.
John-John… Do you live nearby?
Sure, just on the other side of the bay.
Elisabeth!
-Hi! -Hi.
-It's so good to see you. Yes, likewise.
When I was young, I also dreamt of being an actor.
I took some classes in the States,
but, you know, it's a little uncertain, financially.
But it's bold to pursue a career where very few get to work.
But it's bold to pursue a career where very few get to work. And it has to be extra tough for people like you.
-What do you mean? -I… I didn't mean anything…
I just meant that it must be extra tough for kids like you, who come from…
-What are you talking about? -We're talking about acting.
-Karl here said he took acting classes. -Well…
You did? No, yes, well, mostly for the fun of it.
-Why did you stop? -Wasn't my thing.
Right, and also the economic uncertainty.
Mm… too bad.
Come on, I want to show you something.
Sorry about dad's friend.
It's fine.
I hope you didn't feel obligated to be here.
No, absolutely not.
-Shit, wow. Which ones are these? -I don't know. I was given them.
-Are they good? -You can try them.
Sweet.
Hear anything?
Shit, I can't hear a thing!
-I'm happy you came. -What?
Good sound, huh?
Yeah. Let me know if you get tired of them.
Wow, you look like her.
What was her name?
Lotta.
Elisabeth!
I'm coming! Just a second.
-I have to go. -I'm leaving anyways.
-See you at school. -Yeah.
What happened? He left me.
I thought things were good.
Just as well. He's a dickhead.
Did you two fight?
-Huh? -No.
You'll meet someone new.
No.
I'm no good.
What?
Are you ready? Don't drop this, okay?
I got it.
-Police, open up! -Open!
Police!
-Do you have anything on you? -No.
Okay, let's do it. Corporal expression.
-Yes. -Okay.
-Pick your animal. -Okay.
Dog? Okay.
Ouch! Stop.
Sorry.
Act like dogs.
They move like this, right?
Come on. Try to focus.
Wolves don't just stand around. No.
We have to get somewhere with this. Let's take it seriously.
Okay, uh… Let's do something abstract. If we, um…
-Come join us. -No, I think I'll stay here.
-Come on, let's go. -No…
Okay.
Should we do the wave?
Yes. If we do a circle.
-No… -What the…?
-Who let you in? -It was open.
-Do you know how much this equipment is? -We're just rehearsing.
Out.
Out!
Well, I have to go, but I'll see you at the party.
-Okay, bye. -Bye.
-Are you taking the subway? -No, I'm waiting for a ride.
Have you read the text analysis?
No, not yet.
They're showing it at the Royal Theatre, so…
I figured it might be easier if you've seen it.
What? Are there still seats? Yeah. Ulla can get some through her mother.
-Right. -Are you game?
-You, me and Ulla? -No, she's seen it.
-So, like a date? -No, not… I mean…
-Like a school assignment. -Mm.
-Or I could ask Staffan. -No, I want to go.
Okay. But it's the Royal Theatre. Sure you'll find it?
Okay. But it's the Royal Theatre. Sure you'll find it? I think so.
-Hurry up! -I'm coming!
I'll see you tonight. Bye.
-Take care. -Call me. Bye.
-Are you going out? -To the theatre.
Honey, you have to tell me things like that.
I have to get back to work. I'd rather you kept Patricia company.
-What? I can't babysit her every night. -You don't.
-Yes, yesterday and the day before that-- -Please, we have to help each other out.
-So, mom dies and my social life with her? -Cut it out.
-Patricia needs you. -No, she needs you.
I can't be in two places at once!
I have to work to make ends meet. It's as simple as that.
I realize it's dreary, but you can't have everything.
-I'll call you later. -No. I said, you're staying home.
-We'll see… -We will not see!
Not tonight.
The person you've dialed can't be reached.
-You can't trust upper class chicks. -What do you know?
She's not the only one who wants to rebel. They're called Cilla, Pernilla, Camilla…
I even have a fucking Annika on my phone.
Firstly, You have no experience of Swedish chicks.
Secondly, I'm with JJ. I also want a Swedish chick.
I don't care where she's from. And when have you been with a Camilla?
I'll show you Camilla.
-This is Camilla. -He's got the phone out.
Hey, turn the music down.
Turn it down. Hello?
Turn it down. Hello? Hi. Sorry, I've tried to reach you.
I had to stay at home.
-Okay. -Darling! Who are you talking to?
-Okay. -Darling! Who are you talking to? -My battery died. -Where are you?
-My battery died. -Where are you?
I'm in a car.
-Uh… -Darling!
Do you want to come here? Then we can work on the text.
Yeah, sure, I'll swing by.
-Okay. -Bye.
-You have no fucking shame! -Hey, JJ is gonna…
Shut up!
-Hi. -Hey. Do you recognize me?
Yes, I do. How are you?
All good. I can't complain.
You want to go for a ride?
-We have an assignment to do. Open up. -Hey, chill out.
-How are you? -Good. You?
-I'm good. Donya, meet… -Elisabeth.
-What have you been up to? -Nothing, just chatting.
-They had a date, but she stood him up. -Shut up!
I had to babysit my sister.
We had a school assignment, my phone died…
-Did you use that line as well? -When did I say it was a date?
You have to toughen up, bro.
What about your chicks?
I'm hooking up with this girl. You don't believe me? I am!
-Please shut up when I'm talking to you. -Did you eat the garlic one?
Yeah, it's good.
How's training going?
If you're as ripped as you say, just shrug it off.
-It doesn't seem to be working. -What?
-Are you stoked for the gym tonight? -Elisabeth.
-Are you stoked for the gym tonight? -Elisabeth. Elisabeth! I've got an important question, okay?
Very important.
-Yalla, get to the point. -Chill, bro.
All the boys are wondering…
Can JJ act?
-No. -Oh, no.
Is he good?
It depends.
I'd say… One to ten?
A strong…
A difficult situation.
-I dare you to say five. -Four?
What? Oh, shit.
Hey, what do you think, huh?
Hey, what do you think, huh? Listen, of course he can act. He's going to get us to Hollywood.
Listen, of course he can act. He's going to get us to Hollywood. Bro, he can't even get us downtown.
Okay, hang on. You'll see.
Are you not sure of him, huh?
Elisabeth, I've got a question. Can you act?
-Good question. -Of course she can act.
-Can you? -No, I don't know.
Yes, she can. I promise you.
Act for us.
-Now? -Yes.
-No. -Chill, bro.
What's the big deal?
-Leave her alone. -What?
Why are you scared?
-Here? -Leave her alone.
-No. -Chill, bro.
-You afraid? -Are you?
-I'll do it. -Yeah, me too.
-What should we do? -You choose.
-We're breaking up. -Okay. You, with me?
You think you'd break up with me?
-Show us what you've got. -Chill, man.
Are you ready?
Elisabeth…
…we need to talk. I don't know if you've noticed…
I haven't been answering your calls. I'm going to tell it like it is.
I don't like you anymore.
This relationship isn't working.
I can't take it. It's just a pain.
I… -I like someone else. -Wow.
-I like someone else. -Wow.
-I've found another girl. I'm sorry. -Classic.
So, it's over.
I'm just saying it as it is.
We can be friends. It's chill.
-What are you laughing at? -Shut up and keep going.
Wait, you…why are you crying? I don't get it. Why are you crying?
When you cash in, we can be your bodyguards.
-I'll be your manager. -Manager?
-You, the manager? -Shut the fuck up.
-Please. -Please.
-Yalla. -Bye.
-Bye. -Bye.
Later, bro. Yalla.
-I should get going. -I'll see you around.
Do you want to walk me home?
It's so dark, and you've lured me into the hoods…
Okay, let's go.
Okay. Good night.
Papa's not home yet.
Okay…
Want to go for a swim?
Do you have a guy?
-A guy? -Are you with someone?
-So, who was he? -Who?
-The guy at the party. -Who?
You know who I mean.
Jonas?
Tall, blond? With dimples?
Yeah, maybe.
What's so funny?
-He's my cousin. -Oh.
Do you have a girlfriend?
-No. -Why the hesitation?
What?
Elisabeth?
-What are you doing? -I'm swimming.
Yeah, I see that.
Sorry I raised my voice, and thanks for helping out.
No problem.
-Good night. -Good night.
I have to go, but…
-See you at the party. -Yeah, see you there.
Hey, where the hell are you?
Get away from the music. I can't hear a thing.
What?
Have you seen Elisabeth?
No, sorry. I haven't seen her.
I met your sister. She was so cool.
-Just now? -Yeah, she was over by the bar.
-Virgo? -No.
-Capricorn? -Yes.
Yes?
-I told you! I know this shit. -It took you ten guesses.
What are you doing?
Elisabeth…
Hey. What's up?
Our taxi was cancelled. Are you going into town?
-Maybe. Where are you going? -Can you drop us at the nearest subway?
That shouldn't be a problem.
What a cute girl this guy brought.
You know what?
Maybe I should just take you home instead.
We're going to a friend, so…
-So you don't want a ride? -No, thanks. Let's go.
-No. -That's enough.
You know what? Let me borrow your phone.
-Leave her alone. -I need to call a friend.
What, I can't borrow it?
Wallets and jewelry.
-Now. -Yalla!
Good. Come on.
Yalla. Hurry up.
What are you doing?
What's this?
Let go, man.
Give me the watch.
It's fake.
-I don't give a fuck. I want it anyway. -No.
-Give it to him. -Take my phone-- Give it to him!
Listen to her.
-What are you doing? -Fuck you!
Give him the watch!
Give him the watch.
Elisabeth, are you alright?
Are you okay?
Elisabeth?
Are you okay?
I'm really sorry.
Why didn't you give them the watch?
-Elisabeth, wait! -Leave me alone.
-Elisabeth! -I said, leave me alone!
Get in the car.
You stay away from my daughter, hear me?
-I want you to stop seeing him. -I can't see him because we got robbed?
-It could've happened to anyone. -No, it couldn't.
Guys like him are shit magnets.
The break-in wasn't a coincidence.
What do you mean?
-You know what I mean. -No, I don't.
You sound like a prejudiced old man.
Okay, I'll be honest with you. You're selfish, naive and terribly spoilt!
Wake up.
You're lucky nothing worse happened.
I don't want you seeing him outside of school.
Just… No.
Go to bed.
Are you in love?
And she doesn't feel the same?
-I think she does. -There you are.
Then go after her.
It'll be okay.
It'll be okay, baby.
Elisabeth!
Elisabeth!
-I need to talk to you! -Be quiet! Everyone's sleeping.
If you'll let me in!
I'll come down.
I fucked up. Big time.
I'm sorry.
It could've gone really bad.
Why did argue with those guys?
The watch wasn't mine.
I shouldn't have worn it.
I think it's expensive.
So why were you wearing it?
I wanted to impress you.
I'm sorry.
What do you want me to do? I'll do anything. What should I do?
Look…
…I'm in love with you. For real.
I've never felt like this.
I can't be without you.
You're wet.
Do you have a condom?
I think so. I do, yeah.
-Did you plan for this? -What? No, no.
I'm just kidding.
-Where are we going? -Just follow. My sister told me about it.
-Hi. -Hi.
Okay.
If you show this to anyone else, I'll kill you.
-Damn. -Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God!
How old are you in this picture?
Sluggo. Sluggo!
Cut! Nice!
Oh my God, we have to do that. That was beautiful.
Is that him?
Doesn't he know it's over? Why is he calling?
I don't know what he's thinking!
Let me know if he keeps calling you. Then I'll sort it out, okay?
-Okay. But promise you won't go too far. -I promise.
-So, when are you taking me out? -I promise, I will.
When can I come to yours?
Sluggo.
Listen, I'm going to have a word with this guy. Give me two minutes, okay?
Yo.
Meet a friend of mine.
Get in.
I can't do that. It's impossible. Am I supposed to…?
-At least we're not that bad. -Bad? We're going to rock.
We'll see.
-Are you nervous? -Nah.
Hello, it's Elisabeth.
Yes, he's here.
It's for you. It's Sluggo.
-Hello? -I need my stuff right now, okay?
-Okay. I finish in five. -I said, right now.
-Okay, I'm coming. -Okay.
I have to go.
-Did something happen? -No, it'll be fine.
-What? -Nothing. See you tomorrow.
-What happened? -Just give me the bag.
I need to say something. Don't freak out.
No promises. Just say it.
I fucked up.
What do you mean?
The watch with the blue strap is gone.
-Are you kidding? -I borrowed it and got robbed.
By who?
Two guys. I haven't seen them before.
You're so stupid. How are you going to solve this?
-I'll work overtime. -Work overtime? Are you fucking stupid?
What?
Why were you wearing a 200K watch?
-Are you fucking retarded? -What?
If you weren't my bro, I'd kick your ass. You're lucky I care about you.
Fucking idiot.
Do you understand what you've done? They'll kick my ass if I don't pay.
It's in your fucking hands now.
I know where there's stuff.
-Where have you been? -Nowhere. Just out.
It's not there.
It's not there.
-Is it your bag? -What the hell is he doing here?
Of course it's his bag.
-Apologize to Patrik. -Never.
-Apologize to Patrik. -Never. Did you threaten him?
What? What the fuck did you tell her? No, he hit me.
He hit me, and Sluggo and I threw him out. I swear, he hit me.
He hit me, and Sluggo and I threw him out. I swear, he hit me. -Don't listen-- -Shut up! What the fuck did he tell you?
-Don't listen-- -Shut up! What the fuck did he tell you?
Baby. Please.
Apologize to Patrik. I'm begging you.
Man up and admit what you've done.
Or do you want us to call the cops?
John-John. Apologize to Patrik.
-Let go. -Let go.
-Stop it! -Let go!
-Let go! -Stop it!
-Let go of the bag. -Let go of him!
Stop it! Stop…
Are you just going to let him go?
You need to leave.
-I just grabbed him. -Get out.
Get out.
Looks like they're worth 140-150K.
I need to check, but that's what they sell for.
-What's going on? -There was a break-in.
What?
Listen, everyone…
-We have to cancel tonight. -No!
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I'll see if I can find a solution, but…
actually, I'm… Right now, I don't know.
Where's John-John?
Uh… I don't know.
I… I heard they got in via the roof.
What do you mean?
No… Nothing.
-Hey. -Hi.
Hi, you have one new message.
Forgive me.
I've ruined everything.
You deserve someone better. I'm sorry.
Did something happen?
I should've showed you this a long time ago, but…
…I didn't want to tell the police after everything he had done for Patricia.
I probably should have, but…
I'm sorry.
It's sorted. We leave tomorrow.
I texted my cousin. We can stay there two or three weeks.
What do you say?
It'll be nice, trust me. We'll be able to relax.
I hope and pray you don't snore.
Have you heard from John-John?
No.
-Have you tried to reach him? -No, why should I?
It's a shame what happened.
If you hear from him, ask him to call me.
-Why? -I want to talk to him.
Will you let him stay on?
If I broke into the school, would you let me stay on?
Do you think it's unfair?
Have you had a look at our yearbook, Elisabeth?
I'm also disappointed.
But I won't give up on him. Not that easily.
Strange. I thought it would be the other way around.
What do you mean?
I thought you'd be the one to quit.
Okay, I see. No problem.
Okay, I understand.
See you later. Kisses. Bye.
-Is she coming? -Yeah, but you know how she is.
-How do I look? She hasn't seen. -It looks like you got beat up.
Remember when you called Hakim out?
He knocked you senseless.
-That was nothing. -Nothing? Are you joking?
-Your eye was the size of my fist. -You're exaggerating.
Those girls were crying like they'd witnessed a murder.
What were you fighting about?
I don't even remember.
Well, there you go.
Life goes on, right?
Right?
Lighten up, dude.
You and her? It'll sort itself out. Trust me.
-I'll be right back. -Where are you going?
Yo! Hey, asshole!
Are you deaf? Why are you stalking her?
Don't call her. Don't go near her. She's with me now. Got it?
I'll holler at a ho when I want.
I'll fuck you up right here and now.
Say that again.
I thought so, you little cunt.
Where is it?
-Where did you put it? -Come with me, bro.
-Give it to me. -You'll get it back.
Where did you put it?
-I'll look after it. -Give it to me.
What are you going to do? Ruin your life?
-He died in front of me. -I know, but you can't change that.
-I'm not letting him get away with it. -Back off!
Back off! Enough!
-Stay here. We'll call the police. -The police?
Are you crazy?
Please, stay. Please.
He's gone forever. I don't want to lose you. He's gone forever.
Please, listen to me.
Please, listen to me.
Don't come closer. Back off!
Hello? Elisabeth, it's Kiba. Where are you? We need to talk now!
Jump on. Hurry up. I know where he's going.
-Are you ready? -Yes. Go!
911.
No.
-Breathe. -What's happened?
-Tell me what happened! -Take it easy. Look at me. Take it easy.
It's fine. No one is hurt.
Okay.
Good. Are you calm?
-Yes. -Okay.
Elisabeth!
This is nuts! This is so crazy!
[woman] I've got a hard cider and a bag of Crossbone Crunch.
It's a party.
I'm-- I'm just so, so thrilled for you, Kate.
To Comet Dibiasky, right? Cheers!
It's gotta be, look… It's gotta be an Oort cloud comet
just based on where you saw it.
Probably the last time it was this close to the Sun
was long before human civilization.
Look at the arc on that thing. God, it's amazing.
How would we find out the comet's velocity in orbit, Professor Mindy?
That is a good question. [sighs]
This will be fun. I haven't done orbital dynamics since grad school.
Question is, what…
What would Carl Sagan do?
He would take it back to first principles.
The topocentric vector is rho.
Kate, what are the initial coordinates?
[Kate] Twenty-one.
Twenty-four.
Thirteen.
[Mindy] This is fun, huh, guys?
-Sixty-seven. -Wow. Now you got me pumped.
-[man 1] Dr. Mindy. -All right…
How many terms do you have to calibrate…
[Mindy] Approximation of coordinates in Marsden, '85.
Now that we have the comet's orbit, we will check the ephemeris
and that will give us the distance between the comet and planet Earth.
Why does the ephemeris keep getting lower and lower?
Professor Mindy?
Professor Mindy?
You know what, guys? Let's…
Let's call it a night, huh?
[man 2] But what about the relative position?
I can't figure this one out. Not tonight, guys. Sorry.
-[man 1] Let's hit it, man. I'm beat. -[woman 2] Me too.
-[man 1] Kate, this was amazing. -[man 2] Congratulations.
Hey, Kate.
You stay.
[man] Yeah, uh, Dr. Calder,
a Michigan State professor and his grad students--
This is Dr. Calder. You pulled me out of a meeting
where I had to tell my team we lost eight billion in funding.
I am so sorry, Dr. Calder,
but we are seeing some awfully strange orbital numbers
on this comet we just found.
They should be in your inbox, right?
-[Calder] Is this it? -Yeah. This is it.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let me get Dr. Oglethorpe on the line.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let me get Dr. Oglethorpe on the line. Please hold.
Uh… Uh, I'm on hold.
She's calling a Dr. Oglethorpe. Who is that?
Jesus Christ. I'm gonna put them on speaker.
"Dr. Oglethorpe,
head of the Planetary Defense Coordination Office."
-Is that a real place? -I have no idea.
[man on speaker] This is Dr. Oglethorpe.
Yes, this is Jocelyn Calder from Kennedy Space Center.
[Oglethorpe] Hey, Jocelyn.
Listen, we got a sighting of an NEO from Subaru telescope.
Okay. Uh… Why you just didn't report it to the Minor Planet Center?
[Calder] It's a professor and a bunch of Michigan State students
who identified something big.
Really? How large?
[Calder] How big we talking?
We clocked it in around five to ten kilometers wide.
About five to ten kilometers wide.
Uh… That's a big boy.
And, uh, was this professor the one who first made the observations?
Hi, yes. Uh, Dr. Mindy.
And-- And no, PhD candidate Kate Dibiasky found it.
I did the orbital calculations.
I, uh… I study trace gasses in dead galaxies.
I haven't published in a while so you probably haven't heard of me.
But anyway, that doesn't matter. Sorry. What was your question?
What are the most updated estimates on its trajectory?
[Mindy] Kate?
I've been running it all day. I keep getting the same result.
A direct hit of Earth in six months and 14 days.
Me too.
[Calder] Matthew, what are your calculations?
Um, Scout program is saying six months, 14 days.
[Calder] We got six months and 14 days.
And it's roughly five to ten kilometers wide.
Which… Which, uh…
[Mindy] Isn't that…
an extinction-level event?
Well, let's not be dramatic here.
Okay, uh…
First move is to get the school field trip out here to DC.
[Calder] Let's all calm down.
I need the person who first had eyes on the comet and the person in charge.
What?
…share this data immediately with Cambridge, Caltech and IAU.
Wait a minute. This is classified information.
[Mindy] What's happening?
[Calder] I serve at the discretion of the president.
Is this really happening?
…and the dead galaxy professor to Hickam Air Force base.
This isn't happening, right?
Kate, this isn't real, right? This is, uh…
This is just some sort of alternate reality, right?
Say something.
I gotta go get high.
Word is that I need you both in DC fast. Only plane I got going there is that one.
Anyway, I am Dr. Mindy. This is--
-Hi! Oh. -[Captain Robinson] Go, go, go!
-[Mindy] Where do we sit, Kate? -I have no idea.
[Mindy] Is there any customary seating for…
What the fuck? Is this real? Is this a goddamn joke?
Holy shit.
This can't be happening. No.
-Brendon. You mean Brendon? -Yeah, Brendon.
You know, he didn't keep his head down. It's all politics, Teddy. You know that.
[Oglethorpe] You must be Randall and Kate. Yes. Yes, hi.
I'm Dr. Oglethorpe, but you can call me Teddy.
I'm sorry. Did you say your name…
-I should call you "Teddy"? Teddy. -[Oglethorpe] Teddy. Yeah.
[chuckles] Yeah, we call him Teddy because he ain't no teddy bear.
General Themes. I'm the Pentagon's eyes on, uh,
you know, whatever this turns out to be.
The president is famously late, and you've had a long flight, so…
-[sighs] Michigan State Spartans. -[Kate] Mmm.
-Is that the Oval Office? -Yeah, that's the Oval Office, yeah.
It's a lot smaller than in the photographs.
[Oglethorpe] The president should be here shortly. She's already been briefed.
Correct, Scott?
[Scott] That is correct.
Are we really about to tell the president of the United States
that we have just over six months
until humankind, basically every species, is completely extinct?
[breath trembling] Yeah. That's exactly what we're about to do. Yeah.
[Mindy] Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.
[woman 1] Yes, I said law enforcement.
But I didn't want… I mean, you told me that he was clean.
-Hello, Madam President. Dr. Oglethorpe. -[guard] Step back, please.
[Oglethorpe] Hello.
Madam President, I'm Dr. Oglethorpe. I believe Jocelyn briefed you to…
-Hey, Jason. -[Jason] Yeah? What up, yo?
Come on, man. What the hell? This is real world.
Yeah. I know. We need five minutes.
We have a problem with our Supreme Court nominee. Five minutes. Thank you.
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday, dear Patty… ♪
[woman 2] Just take a message, and then, stuff like this happens,
and I don't know what's going on.
I don't understand how many more times I need to tell you…
Well, there's a bunch of stuff about their nominee not being qualified,
but I don't see any articles about our thing.
Social media is just going on and on
about that singer Riley Bina and DJ Chello breaking up.
That's just too bad.
They seem like sweet kids.
Hmm. I don't… I don't know them.
Which is…
-It's a shame though. -Yeah.
-Do you know them, Kate? -Yes.
-But I don't really give a shit right now. -Oh.
They charge an arm and a leg for this stuff.
-Ten apiece ought to do it. -[Mindy] Oh.
-[Scott] Grab a water. -Thank you.
I've got Kate as well.
-Perfect. -[Kate] Thank you.
-Here's a 20. -[Scott] Oh.
-You got change? -No.
-I mean, I could ask the Marine. -Yeah… [mumbles]
Uh, it's a Xanax.
-I only take a quarter. Otherwise I get… -[Oglethorpe] Ah…
-Kate. -Thank you.
You know, you should be careful with that much.
I'm very sorry. I have to be in Okinawa by two o'clock tomorrow.
-[Mindy] What? -What? Are you serious?
-This is very important. -I have to go quell the natives.
Tell your daughter I said hello.
Isn't it important that he was in the room with us? I mean, what…
Where do I pay for these?
It's free.
Really?
Yes, it's the White House.
The snacks are free.
What?
The general.
He charged us for the snacks, but they're free.
Oh, gosh.
[Kate] Why on earth would he do that?
Hey, peeps, uh, it's not looking like it's gonna happen tonight,
and I feel horrible.
We're gonna put you up in a hotel somewhere.
Excuse me, does the president know why we're here?
[Kate] You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[Mindy] They must not know why we're here, right? They know. Uh, but you heard 'em.
-Do they even realize… -[Oglethorpe] Be ready for tomorrow.
…how long it took for us to get…
[Kate] And then they made us wait for over seven hours,
but they never called us in. I couldn't believe it.
Of course they didn't call you in. Kate, have you watched any news today?
No, I've been pretty wrapped up in our… project.
Turn on your TV right now.
President Orlean is in the middle of an all-time shit storm.
[reporter] Sheriff Wade Conlon was already a controversial nominee,
with no law degree and a record of "shoot first and ask questions later."
You watching?
With his background as a nude life model…
Yeah, I'm watching it right now.
…the White House is in full crisis mode.
And, get this. I found five former students
who are willing to go on record that Conlon got noticeably aroused
when he posed for their drawing class.
I have no shame in what I did.
Now, should I say "noticeably aroused"?
Or "engorged"? Because I don't want this to read like clickbait.
You know, this is a real article.
I just… Kate, can I get something from you, please?
[clears throat] Sorry.
-Out of sorts tonight. -Can we have this conversation?
I feel like we're skirting around this.
Do you have an issue with my mom? Is that what this is all about?
[woman] You can't tell me what's going on?
It's just the protocol. Please, don't worry.
Oh, Marshall got a 172 on his LSATs and we're celebrating.
Way to go, Marshall. I'm proud of you, buddy.
-Whoo! Thank you, Dad. Miss you. -[chuckles]
Hey, how's Evan feeling? Are the new meds working out?
-I'm a solid four. -[Mrs. Mindy] Ooh!
He's a solid four.
Well, that's better than last month, right?
You know, just remember to speak up in the meeting tomorrow. Okay?
-Yeah. I will. -You get so quiet.
When it's time to take credit, you kind of…
She asked you if you were a lesbian. She did not say that you were a lesbian.
-It was a question. -Hey, look, I'm…
Can I sit down with your mom to have lunch in, like, seven months?
Seven… That's weirdly specific and distant. What is… This is my mom.
[Orlean] So… Oh!
I heard there's an asteroid or a comet or something
that you don't like the looks of.
[sighs] Tell me about it and then tell me why you're telling me about it.
You got 20 minutes.
-Twenty minutes? -That's you, Doc.
[softly] Go. Now. Go.
Madam President. [breathing heavily]
Approximately 36 hours ago,
uh, PhD candidate Kate Dibiasky here discovered
a very large comet.
-[Mindy] Yeah. -Good for you.
A comet between five to ten kilometers across,
that we estimate came from the, uh… from the… from the Oort cloud.
[Orlean] Wow.
Which is the outermost part of the solar system.
And, um…
And using Gauss's method of orbital determination
and the average astrometric uncertainty of 0.04 arcseconds, we then asked-- -[chuckling] Whoa! What the hell is… What? -I'm so bored. Just tell us what it is.
-[chuckling] Whoa! What the hell is… What? -I'm so bored. Just tell us what it is.
-What? Stop what? -[Jason] Seriously, stop.
What Dr. Mindy is trying to say is there's a comet headed towards Earth,
and according to NASA's computers,
that object is gonna hit the Pacific Ocean
at 62 miles due west off the coast of Chile.
Then what happens? Like, a tidal wave?
No. It will be far more catastrophic.
There'll be mile-high tsunamis fanning out all across the globe.
If this comet makes impact, it will have the power of a billion Hiroshima bombs.
[exhales sharply] There'll be magnitude 10 or 11 earthquakes--
You're breathing weird. It's, uh, making me uncomfortable.
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to articulate the science.
I know. But it's so stressful. I'm trying to, like, listen--
[Mindy] I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation.
I'm trying to articulate it the best I can--
Madam President, this comet is what we call a planet-killer.
[Mindy] That is correct.
So how certain is this?
There's 100% certainty of impact.
Please, don't say 100%.
Can we just call it a potentially significant event?
-[Orlean] Yeah. -Yes.
But it isn't potentially going to happen.
It is going to happen.
Exactly. 99.78% to be exact.
Oh, great. Okay, so it's not 100%.
Well, scientists never like to say 100%.
Call it 70% and let's just move on.
But it's not even close to 70%.
You cannot go around saying to people
that there's 100% chance that they're gonna die.
[chuckling] You know? It's just nuts.
We should get some of our scientists on this, you know.
No offense, but you're just two people that walked in here with--
Dr. Oglethorpe.
Dr. Ov… Ogilvy. Yeah.
I've been head of planetary defense at NASA for 15 years.
And Dr. Mindy is a tenured professor of astronomy at Michigan State,
where Miss Dibiasky is a doctoral candidate.
-[Orlean] Good. -I'm sorry. Did you say Michigan State?
Exactly. They have an excellent astronomy department.
-[Mindy] Yes. -Come on, bro.
You kidding? You wanna see my fucking SAT scores?
Okay, let's bottom line this.
What is this gonna cost me?
You know, what's the ask here?
There are government plans in place.
Um, actions we can take through NASA.
-[Mindy breathing heavily] -Drones that can be outfitted with nukes
to deflect and hopefully change the orbit of this comet.
We must act now.
[Orlean] Oh, hey. All right, all right, all right.
-When are the midterms? Three weeks. -Three weeks.
So, if this breaks before then, we lose Congress.
Then there's nothing we can do about it.
It'll be gridlocked.
-The timing is just… It's atrocious. -[drawer opens and closes]
Okay, at this very moment, I say we sit tight and assess.
[Jason] Sit tight and assess. [Orlean] Let's get some other people on this. Some Ivy Leaguers.
[Orlean] Let's get some other people on this. Some Ivy Leaguers.
And you and I will review the NASA plans.
-Okay? -I'd greatly appreciate that.
Am I to understand correctly that,
after all of the information you've received today,
the decision you're making is to "sit tight and assess"?
-I'm sorry, who is she? -Who the fuck are you? Aren't you her son?
I'm the fucking Chief of Staff, Boy with the Dragon Tattoo.
So I'm doing fine.
[whispers] We gotta get out of here. This place is a freak show.
[Mindy] I think what Miss Dibiasky is trying to say
is that the idea of sitting tight is an extremely, extremely dangerous--
Thank you. One good thing happened today. [chuckles]
Okay, funny story. [clears throat]
When I was running for president,
I had to sneak cigarettes for the whole first month of the campaign
because, you know, photographs of me smoking
went for, what, a hundred grand a pop?
So, I'm always hiding, but, you know, I just got sick of it.
And I just said, "You know what, I'm gonna smoke whenever I want to." [chuckles] Mmm…
Guess what happened?
-I went up three points in the polls. -[Jason] They loved that she kept it real.
They love watching a smokeshow smoke.
I can't think of another president that I'd ever wanna see in Playboy.
Do you know how many, uh, "the world is ending" meetings
that we've had over the years?
Economic collapse, loose nukes, car exhaust killing the atmosphere.
-Rogue AI. -Drought, famine, plague…
-Uh… -[Orlean] Everything.
[chuckles] Alien invasion, population growth, hole in the ozone--
Jason, hey.
-Read the room for once in your life. -Sorry, Mom.
Point is, I have a job to do.
You do understand that this is an apocalyptic event.
This is a large celestial body heading towards our planet at speeds--
Dr. Mindy, I hear you.
I hear you.
-You should be proud. -[breathes deeply] Thank you.
I'm taking it very seriously. I'm taking it straight in the heart.
I'm so glad to hear that. You have no idea.
Hey, gang, obviously everything we talked about in here, super classified, right?
-[Oglethorpe] Yeah. -Cool.
Thanks for dressing up.
[Mindy] You're saying we're just gonna leak it to the press?
-Isn't that illegal? -Hell yeah, we're going to leak it.
In case you didn't notice, the White House just blew us off.
My boyfriend, Phillip, says he knows a reporter
from the New York Herald who will talk to us.
-Adul Grelio. -Good. He's a heavy hitter.
And I'll reach out to more of the scientific community on the down-low.
-I just feel like this isn't what I do. -You're just telling a story.
Keep it simple.
No math.
But it's all math.
[male voice on video] It all started with a connection.
A simple gesture that created so much.
So many choices.
Sometimes, it can even feel like too much.
Until now.
Introducing BASH LiiF.
Life, without the stress of living.
[woman on PA] Before we introduce the founder and CEO of BASH,
please remember to avoid direct eye contact,
sudden movements, coughing or negative facial expressions.
And now, please welcome Sir Peter Isherwell.
[man 1] We love you, Peter!
[man 2] We love you, Peter!
Hello, everyone.
All of my life's work,
really, I see has been driven by an inexpressible need for a friend
who would understand and soothe me.
And you know, now all those years of work have come to fruition with BASH LiiF,
our new BASH 14.3, uh, phone
is fully integrated into your every feeling and desire
without you needing to say one single word.
If I feel…
-Sad. -[boy] Afraid.
Or alone.
The BASH 14.3 phone, when set to the life setting,
instantly senses my mood through blood pressure…
-Uh, heartbeats and-- -[phone chimes]
[automated voice] Your vitals show that you are sad.
This will cheer you up, Peter.
[girl] ♪ You are my best friend You are my best friend ♪
[singing indistinctly] ♪ You make me happy… ♪ [Peter laughing] Oh, that's wonderful.
[Peter laughing] Oh, that's wonderful.
That video. Um…
It also, seriously, uh, schedules
a therapy session with a nearby professional,
so we can make sure that these sad feelings never ever ever return.
-May I say something, Mr. Isherwell? -[Peter] No.
And to support, uh, BASH LiiF, uh, I wanna officially announce…
Oh, give me the phones. They're not yours.
-[softly] Say bye. -Bye, Mr. Isherwell.
Bye, Peter.
Um, I love you, Peter.
Are you sure the video of the puppy on the rooster is optimizing our prepubescent sense memory consumer sector?
is optimizing our prepubescent sense memory consumer sector?
I find the bird quite threatening.
We will cross-check the data on that, for sure.
Mr. Isherwell, Paul Debent wanted me to give this to you.
He got it from an astronomer friend of his in Mexico.
Oh, my.
What other confirmation do we have on this, Adul?
[Adul] I've spoken to Dr. Oglethorpe in DC and he confirmed it and all the math.
Then I showed it to Dr. Franks at Columbia,
and he almost fell out of his chair.
So, look, I have to admit. I was very skeptical at first,
but this is all quite credible.
The calculations are credible.
Jesus.
And the president really said to sit tight?
-[Mindy] Yes. That's correct. -"Sit tight and assess."
She's probably worried about the midterms.
We need to move fast.
The feds will claim breach of security,
so make sure these two get a pro bono attorney.
-[woman 1] You can use my attorney. -You can certainly afford it now.
We're gonna hire a lawyer?
-[woman 1] That wasn't necessary. -[woman 2] It was.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.
That was not called for.
[Mindy] I just have a question here.
How is it criminal if we just tell people,
like the public, you know, what we saw, and tell them the truth?
Make sure this one gets media training before he hits the shows.
He seems a step slow.
What does that mean, I need media training?
They want us on a show called The Daily Rip
first thing in the morning before the article comes out.
You guys know what The Daily Rip is?
It's like the best show. Everyone wants to be on it.
Brie and Jack have legendary chemistry.
They asked me to go on once.
I was so excited I couldn't sleep for two nights,
but then they cut me for time.
Still hurts me to think about that.
I know what show you're talking about. My wife loves that show.
Okay, can you just tell me what this is all about? Okay?
'Cause you haven't read my article on Conlon getting hard in the art class.
Now Adul Grelio has come down from his mountaintop for your thing.
You won't even give me a lousy pronoun? Come on.
A comet, bigger than the asteroid that destroyed the dinosaurs,
is headed directly at Earth.
If it isn't deflected, the entire planet dies.
Wait, what did you just say?
It's for a video game.
Are you being serious?
Yes.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! What the fuck, man?
I love you too. All right. Yeah.
Hey, guys, we gotta keep walking, all right?
Come on.
-You must be Dr. Mindy and Miss Dibiasky? -Yes.
Jack and Brie are so excited to have you on the show.
Really? They know who we are?
White House is denying they even met with them.
Well, assholes will always be assholes.
Hi, I'm Thalia.
The Herald sent me to help with your wardrobe.
Oh, I'm not wearing that.
[woman 1] Yeah, you actually have really great facial structure.
How 'bout if we trim this beard down a little bit and--
I love your hair.
Thank you.
How are we gonna do this? I talk about the discovery and you…
talk about how urgent it is that we take action.
[whispers] How do we say it? I mean…
-Shouldn't we practice it or write it out? -[woman 1] Can I get you some water?
Yeah, water. Yeah, water would be nice.
You are here now. You are here now. You are here now.
[repeating] Eleven benevolent elephants. Eleven benevolent elephants.
-Just gonna take some Xanax. -Hmm.
[Mindy] I take it sometimes when I…
Kate, not this time. Not this time.
[sighs] He just needs to breathe and speak up. You know?
He's got this. I know he does.
Oh, God. Come on.
You are here now. You are here now. You are here now. You're here now.
Oh, God!
[Jack] You gotta stop drinking the cheap shit.
-It's only two glasses. -Yeah, two and a half.
-[man] We're 20 out. -Always running late.
[man] Let's make sure that our eye lines,
that we're not looking at Jack and Brie, please, all right?
And cue the package.
-Ladies okay? -Yes. And we're live.
Brie, I've got something for you today. Listen to this.
President Orlean's Supreme Court nominee, Sheriff Conlon,
President Orlean's Supreme Court nominee, Sheriff Conlon, has now been identified as appearing in a softcore porn cable show
-from the early '90s… -Ridiculous.
-…called Satin Sheet Nights. -[imperceptible]
-This story just keeps going and going… -[Brie on TV] Oh, my gosh.
[whispers] Is that Riley Bina?
-[Brie] Yes, well, it's a… -[Mindy] Really?
[whispers] She looks a lot smaller in person, doesn't she?
-[Brie] Ride 'em, cowboy. -[laughing]
-[Jack] Good. -[Brie] Hee-haw!
Hey, everyone. I'm Sean from the show.
Uh, we're gonna do… Jack and Brie are gonna do ten on the SCOTUS nominee.
-Riley Bina, you'll come on and-- -I get to talk about my single, right?
A portion of the profits goes to the manatee sanctuaries.
Yes, but the, uh, breakup first.
And then Dr. Mindy and Miss Dibiasky,
you'll come on and talk about that planet you discovered.
Uh… Comet. We found a comet.
They know what we're here to talk about, right?
Of course. Jack and Brie love doing science segments.
Just remember, keep it light, fun.
-Jack and Brie love having a good time. -[sighing]
That's not promising.
You guys discovered a comet? That's so dope.
I have a tattoo of a shooting star on my back.
-Oh. -That's terrific. [chuckles]
We heard about your breakup too, so we just wanna say…
We're very sorry, right?
We're real sorry. You seem like a… great person.
Why don't you mind your own business, you old fuck?
Okay.
Not gonna lie, but, um, my friends
and my Vroom Vroom Army have been so amazing.
So, I'm really grateful for that. But, yeah, I can't lie. It's been hard.
-You're an inspiration. It's incredible. -To so many.
You're really owning that pain.
You know, Jack, I feel like there's some kind of conversation
that we need to be having here. Is there any message
that we need to be having here. Is there any message that you would like to send to your, uh, ex, DJ Chello?
You know, um…
[Jack] If there's something--
-Yeah. -Right here in this camera.
Tell him. As if that was him. You tell him exactly what you're thinking.
Okay, um… [clears throat]
Chell.
[sighs] I still love you, and, um, after many sleepless nights,
three,
I wanna take you back.
I'm sorry. Whoa, uh…
-Is that okay? -Yeah.
-[Brie on TV] He cheated on you. -Oh, my God. You guys…
Yeah. I do.
-Diddly just exploded. -So did Vroom Vroom.
BASH News just sent me eight push notifications.
-About this? -Yeah, look.
My phone just purchased DJ Chello's latest single.
What the… It just did that without asking.
I'm being told that we have DJ Chello live on a Mugg link.
-What's he got to say for himself? -I love the producers here.
Hey, baby doll. Hey.
-Hi. Hi, baby. [crying] -[Jack] He's in tears.
-Your kid messed up bad. -I know.
Lady Baroque wasn't wearing any panties in the club that night.
-It's fine. -I just got all crazy.
I wasn't thinking straight. I made a mistake.
But, look, it's always been you.
Oh! I get it. It's okay.
I hooked up with her too, last year at the Music Globes
right before I ran off with that power forward from the Nuggets,
and none of that matters.
What about "Forget breakup sex. Try breakup relationship"?
-That's good. -Come on.
"Ten famous second chances for two-timers," guys.
It's on a plate.
I've been scared, but, honestly, I'm not scared anymore.
Okay.
My little bumblebee, will you marry me?
-[gasps] Oh, my God. Of course. -[Jack] Oh, wow.
-Chell, of course. -[DJ Chello] Yes!
-Yes! -That's sick.
[DJ Chello] Yes!
All right, DJ Chello.
-[cell phones vibrating] -What is happening?
Just bought another.
-Who are these people again? -They're like the biggest names…
Well, the fireworks have certainly gone off today.
-They have. -What a zinger!
[Jack] Yes, they have.
From a wedding proposal to a little science experiment.
I'll need a temple rub and a martini later on.
[Brie] Our last guests today have made a pretty big discovery in space.
Astronomer Dr. Randall Mindy
and PhD candidate Miss Kate Dibiasky are here.
Welcome to the show.
Can I ask you one thing before we go any further? I have to know this.
Is there life out there?
-Can you tell us? Yes or no, final answer. -We don't have the data.
But sure, in the vastness of space, why not?
Yes, aliens are real.
I knew I'd like this guy. Didn't I tell? You owe me 50 bucks.
[Mindy] I'm not saying there's little green men in flying saucers--
-Please don't encourage him, Dr. Mindy. -That's what he's saying.
We'll never get out of here.
Now, Jack was having some fun here.
-Dad looks great. -What did…
-Doesn't he look good? -They did something with his beard.
[Brie] With the aliens…
[chuckling] Really… He really does.
-[Jack] So much. -[Brie chuckles] Dr. Randall…
You'll regret it. Now, look, Jack's just having some fun here
You'll regret it. Now, look, Jack's just having some fun here with the aliens or whatever,
but there's a New York Herald story that's just come out that talks about…
Keep it right there. You're doing good.
-…the two of you have made. -[Mindy] That's right, Brie.
Kate was, um, observing supernovas…
Yo, that's your girl?
-Yeah. -Not bad.
…an absolutely shocking and once-in-a-lifetime discovery.
I had no idea that Subaru made telescopes.
This has to be exciting. Tell us what you found, Miss Diabasky.
Um, I was monitoring exploding stars
to help measure the expansion of the universe and--
-For your PhD, right? -Yeah.
[Kate] I saw something I didn't recognize.
It was a comet.
[Kate] A big one.
It's headed directly at Earth, and it really likely will hit.
This sounds very, very exciting.
Exploding stars, like, stars actually explode.
Um, how big is this thing?
Can it destroy someone's house? Is that possible?
Well, Comet Dibiasky, which is what it will officially be named--
-[Jack] After her? -Yeah, after her.
-[Brie] Congratulations. -[Jack] What an honor. Congratulations.
It's somewhere between six and nine kilometers across.
-So-- -It's big.
It would damage the entire planet.
Not just a house, you know?
The entire planet.
Okay, as it's damaging, will it hit this one house in particular
that's right on the coast of New Jersey? It's my ex-wife's house.
Can we make that happen?
You and Shelly have a great relationship. Stop.
You need to stop.
I will, but in all fairness, I actually paid for the house.
[Brie] I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, are we not being clear?
We're trying to tell you
that the entire planet is about to be destroyed.
-[Jack] Okay, um… -[Brie] Well, it's, you know…
It's something we do around here. We just keep the bad news light.
Right. It helps the medicine go down.
Speaking of medicine, tomorrow we've got--
Well, maybe the destruction of the entire planet
isn't supposed to be fun.
Maybe it's supposed to be terrifying. And unsettling.
[Adul] No, please don't do that.
-And you should stay up all night… -[Adul] Please.
…every night crying,
when we're all 100% for sure gonna fucking die!
-[crying] -Hey, Kate.
[Kate] I'm sorry.
Hey, man.
My brother has bipolar disorder. So if you ever need anyone to talk…
-Uh… [inhales sharply] -Okay.
Is she always like that?
-I-- -[Brie] Something I said?
-[Jack and Brie chuckle] -[Jack] Right?
Maybe I should have given her that extra Xanax that I had.
Listen, if you don't have enough, we all have enough around here for her.
A spoonful of Xanax makes the medicine go down, right?
[Jack] That's right. That's good.
-We're gonna have to get you back. -[Jack] I knew I'd like this guy.
-Is he a plant? [laughing] -[Jack] I knew it.
[Brie] Okay.
Well, the handsome astronomer
can come back anytime, but the yelling lady, not so much.
[Jack] Not so much. Join us tomorrow when our guest will be the man
that many say will challenge President Orlean in two years.
Senator Jeff Lerner will be here.
And wrongly-convicted murderer, Michelle Weems,
talks to us about her controversial third-place finish on Celebrity Dance Off.
-I thought she would've won. -Yes. I still think she's guilty.
-That's The Daily Rip, guys. -[Brie] Have a great day.
-[producer] And we're out! -The show's over?
-I mean, didn't… -[Jack] Yeah.
-Did what we wanted to say come across? -No, it's over.
You were great, but I think mullet girl, she probably needs some media training.
-Really? -Yeah, no, terrible, buddy.
[Brie] Oh… Thanks. Thanks, Billy.
Uh, we usually get drinks at Aundrine's after our five o'clock staff meeting.
You know, it's fun. You should come.
Oh, I'll have to see. Thank you for the invitation. Thank you.
Kate? Kate?
-Hey. You were awesome. -Oh, thanks.
Can I get a photo of you for my portfolio?
-Yeah, sure. -Thanks. -[camera clicks] -Thank you.
[woman] You can see this spike here is when Riley Bina asked to take DJ Chello back
on the segment before you.
We saw engagement across all social media platforms.
Hmm. And what about our story?
[woman] Randall and Kate,
your TV appearance got some nice traffic when Miss Dibiasky cursed.
But, unfortunately, there was an immediate backlash
-that quickly became a meme. -[Kate gasps]
Oh, Jesus.
-Oh, that's terrible. -They just think I'm crazy.
I mean, look at that. That's so unnecessary.
-You can move on, Erin. -Yeah.
That is just so… Is that even allowed on the Internet or…
I think that's Photoshop, Kate.
[Erin] The trick is to not take it personal…
[chuckling] Dr. Mindy, on the other hand, had some very high favorables.
Vegan*Babe wrote, "Meow! Me likey hunky Star Man."
Uh, some accounts called him "The Bedroom Eyes Doomsday Prophet"
or A-I-L-F, which means "astronomer I'd like to fuck." [people] Oh…
I don't see what that has to do with anything, do you?
And that's everything.
We did not feature or push on any sites,
and clicks overall were below basic weather and traffic stories.
So that… That… That's it?
-[Kate] I knew it. -That's it.
-Thank you, Erin. -[Erin] Yeah, no problem.
[Mindy] I don't… I don't understand.
I don't understand. There's no response.
There's absolutely no… Why aren't people terrified?
What do we have to say? What do we have to do?
There are scientists in Mexico and Spain who are currently going through the data,
and, uh, South Korea has expressed--
-That's great. South Korea. -Hey.
Let us not bullshit each other.
The bottom line is, you guys told us the science was 100%.
It's not. Now we look like idiots.
-No. Who said the science is not 100%? -Excuse me?
I wanna talk to this person. You tell me who said the science--
Dr. Jocelyn Calder, the head of NASA,
just came out calling it "more near-miss hysteria."
She's the one who told us not to say anything.
"More near-miss hysteria."
Is she even an astronomer?
She's the head of NASA, but maybe she doesn't know what she's talking about.
She's the head of NASA, but look,
she's a "former anesthesiologist and a President Orlean super donor."
Let's not be dramatic here.
It's all corrupt.
Yes, but the point is that Adul's right. There's still serious debate.
And now the Herald has egg on its face.
We've taken that story as far as it goes.
Ladies, gentlemen, I wish you a very pleasant end of times.
[Mindy] It's not a goddamn story, okay?
We have precisely six months, ten days,
two hours, 11 minutes and 41 seconds,
until a comet twice the size of Chicxulub
tears through our atmosphere and extincts all life on Earth.
[chuckles] When did you do those calculations?
I put the moment of impact on a diet app.
So, impact is when my diet ends.
Only I'm not on a diet. I'm just crying five times a day.
-I'm scared. -Hey, come on. Come on.
Everyone should be panicking right now, okay?
-Don't cry. Come on. -[Kate] I know.
That prick!
[Mindy] What happened?
Guess my boyfriend just broke up with me.
-God, what a day. What a day… -[crying]
You're gonna die! You're gonna die! You're…
[reporter on TV] It started with a photo many thought was an armpit
or the chin of a man with a strange beard.
But what's emerging now is a scandal…
President Orlean sent her Supreme Court nominee
a cell phone picture of her private parts.
-Holy crap! -[woman] It's clickbait material.
Is this what you want in your country as a leader?
Isn't she the same person who told poor people
that if they don't wanna be poor, they should pick better lottery numbers?
She actually said that.
A source also confirmed to me that
the two have been having an affair for years.
And as recently as yesterday…
Members of my party are currently drawing up a formal censure of the president,
Janie Orlean…
[Mindy] Oh, my God, honey.
This guy doesn't even know what a heliocentric orbit is,
and he's calling me a crackpot. [chuckles]
He says that,
"Jewish billionaires invented this comet threat
so the government can confiscate our liberty and our guns."
"#DontBeScared." Unbelievable.
My God.
You've been on that site a lot lately.
Yeah. I mean, I… I have, like, a quarter million subscribers, honey.
I gotta use my voice to get the truth out there, right?
I'm, uh, going for a walk if you wanna come.
[Mindy] It is called the scientific method… …and it is what created the computer
that you are typing your half-witted conspiracy theories on.
What do you think about that?
[Mrs. Mindy] Randall?
-Yeah, honey? -Someone's here to see you.
Who? Oh, boy.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, God, right. Okay.
Right.
Are you Dr. Randall Mindy?
[Mindy] Yes, sir. I am.
[woman mockingly] "We're all gonna die."
Fuck off, please.
FBI! Freeze! Get on your knees right now! Get on your knees!
You're under arrest for breach of national security secrets.
Jesus Christ!
You could've just called me or showed up to my apartment.
What are you, dressed up as a blind guy?
-[agent] Get on the ground! -Okay. Now be cool.
I just have more skin pigmentation than you.
'Cause your ancestors migrated to Northern Europe
and developed lighter skin so as to not get…
[Kate] Unless you assholes are taking me to the Batcave,
fuck you for putting this hood on me.
Watch out for him. He'll charge you for free shit.
[whispers] What's he doing here? Is he here for us?
Gentlemen, you can come in.
[Orlean chuckles] I think it was Winston Churchill who…
Or maybe it was Bobby Knight who said, "The great labor of leadership
is to lay down one's yoke of pride
and admit that mistakes were made."
[Jason] You were deceived, as was I, but the end result was,
[Jason] You were deceived, as was I, but the end result was, we had our scientists who went to, uh, the prestigious schools of Harvard,
we had our scientists who went to, uh, the prestigious schools of Harvard, Princeton, et cetera.
They confirmed the data. So we would like to offer you a…
presidential apology.
Really?
And we are fully prepared to mobilize
in historic fashion in order to save this planet.
[man] The best news we've heard in a long time.
So, basically, what you're saying is you're about to lose the midterms 'cause you got caught
you're about to lose the midterms 'cause you got caught sending pictures of your cooch to your porn-star sheriff boyfriend.
sending pictures of your cooch to your porn-star sheriff boyfriend.
So now it's to your advantage to act on the comet?
Right.
[Kate] Okay.
[chuckling] Okay. I'm just…
[sighs] God, I'm so relieved that you guys are doing something.
-Hey, come on. Hey. -This has been really…
-[crying] Really, really hard. -Come here.
This has been really, really, really stressful on all of us.
Yes, I will agree.
This will take some heavy weight off all of us--
[laughing] Sorry, you just look so bad when you cry.
[Orlean] Maybe, possibly.
People are gonna ask why we didn't act earlier.
So you're gonna have to take the hit on this one.
Yeah, but we'll take care of you down the road, Jocelyn.
-We will. -Of course, Janie.
I will resign in disgrace first thing tomorrow.
-[Orlean] Good. Yeah, good. -That's weird as hell.
[whispers] She's an anesthesiologist.
I'm going to make a statement,
presidential statement to the American people.
And we're not gonna tell the press about it ahead of time
because that way it will have the appearance
of a breaking emergency sort of…
[woman on TV] Good things come to those who wait.
-[device chimes on TV] -[woman on TV] See? [man on TV] Whoo!
Oh, my God!
[man on TV] We interrupt this broadcast of Jackpot Fiancé
for an emergency message from the president of the United States.
Citizens of the United States and peoples of the world,
I have just been handed
scientific findings that confirm a worst-case scenario.
An unprecedented comet, nine kilometers wide,
is now on a direct collision course with our cherished home, planet Earth.
is now on a direct collision course with our cherished home, planet Earth. Estimated time of arrival is approximately five months from now.
So we have…
We've drawn up a massive Congressional spending bill…
I have already put together an emergency spending package for Congress…
[Jason] …that the Senate and the House have agreed upon.
That's good to hear.
And that will enable NASA and our great military
to launch a preemptive strike,
using decommissioned space shuttles and satellites
loaded with nuclear explosives.
We will blow Comet Dibiasky off her course…
But we're gonna need a hero.
We're gonna need a pilot, real guns and…
Shouldn't this mission be accomplished using remote technology?
Washington's always gotta have a hero.
I have asked
Medal of Freedom recipient and outspoken patriot, Benedict Drask,
to undertake this difficult and…
[Mindy] I'm sorry. Isn't he the mercenary gentleman
that was screaming at all those children on the White House lawn?
[Orlean] Yeah. He was given the honor of leading
the presidential initiative in getting kids to exercise.
Get a little air into it, you lard-ass…
You look like a goddamn bunch of pussies.
-[Mindy] I'm sorry. -He's just of another generation.
You know, I used to date him.
Know what happened to the last pussy I worked with in combat?
You ever see inside a man's torso?
Benedict Drask reporting for duty.
-Thank you for the… -He's gonna be fantastic.
He's got a great voice.
-We're gonna let him make a statement. -Some are saying this is a…
He's got a great body too.
-[Calder] He does. -[Orlean] Yeah.
…suicide mission.
…suicide mission. Well, all I ask is,
if I get snuffed,
that you all earn the extra living my sacrifice gives you.
The extra living my sacrifice gives them. [gasps]
-Right? -I wrote that.
Isn't that from Saving Private Ryan?
-Yes. -No, that's something totally different.
And special thanks should also go to this team of scientists behind me…
[Orlean] We're gonna need everybody's help on this.
Everybody.
All have to pitch in and push out this message.
…African-American scientist.
Miss Dibiasky, she…
And we have Kate Dibiasky, who the comet is named after,
but don't blame her.
…connects with the disaffected youth and the mentally ill.
-And other marginal groups. -Thank you.
-[Oglethorpe] We'll do whatever we can. -As long as you do the right thing.
We're there for you.
Especially you, Dr. Mindy, because you poll so much higher than your colleagues. It's wild. [laughing]
than your colleagues. It's wild. [laughing]
He will help us destroy our common enemy, Dibiasky.
Wonderful. Well, I think we're done.
[Jason] Yep, okay. Let's go.
[Kate] Can I say something?
We've been dying to hear what you gotta say.
I didn't vote for you.
But this is obviously much bigger than my misgivings.
So I will be 100% behind this effort.
No matter how offensive I may find you.
Hmm. Wow. That's great.
[Jason] Yeah. That's really nice.
You know, I did have the FBI put that bag over your head.
They don't do that. The CIA does, but I made them do it.
You know, I had a feeling. I really did.
It's a good feeling 'cause that is what I did.
-And it was very funny and cool. [laughs] -[Orlean] Okay.
May Jesus Christ bless every single one of you,
especially the honorable members of my own party.
We will prevail.
-We're all gonna die! -[upbeat jazz music plays]
Guys, this comet is seriously stressing me out.
Well, it's coming. People gotta dig in.
I already got buyers for these shovels on e-market.
Clean sweep for President Orlean in these midterm elections.
-[woman 1] …how hot he is. -Thousand bucks a pop.
…discharge the duties on which I am about to enter.
"So help you God."
-So help me God. -Congratulations.
[woman 2] We have talk of a Nobel Peace Prize in the offing.
-[man] He's not hot. -[upbeat jazz music continues]
Hello, Sammy.
[laughing] Are you really a doctor?
Well, sort of. I'm an astronomer.
Oh. What is an astronomer?
[Jack] Dr. Mindy, there is a lot of fear out there,
uh, in America, around the world.
Parents don't know what to say to their kids.
What would you say to them to help them understand?
[clicks tongue] Well, I'm sure many of us are frightened right now.
But I can assure you, our best and our brightest, they're on the job.
I've seen the science on this plan and it is sound.
I know your words are a great comfort to all our viewers, Dr. Randall,
and we thank you for your courage and your service.
I'd just like to say
that whenever I feel afraid or alone in this, I…
I think of you and I just… I feel better. So thank you.
That's my job.
-Tell me we're all gonna die. -What?
-Tell me we're all gonna die, do it. -We're all gonna die.
-[moans] -Oh, boy.
[man on TV] So, these two Marxists wave around the word "science"
and we're all supposed to do whatever they say?
Yeah, how do we know there even is a comet?
Mr. Pawketty, Congressman, this data has been proven
and has been peer-reviewed by hundreds of world-renowned scientists.
And we're supposed to trust you? The comet's got your name.
I don't… I don't see the relevancy.
[Pawketty] Why won't you answer the question?
-Answer the question. -What's the question?
Grow up here, okay?
This is ridiculous.
I've just realized, we don't really know anything about each other. Do we?
True.
Well, every time I try to ask you about your life,
you seem to just tell me about your favorite restaurants.
Well, I… You know…
I just despise the, you know,
getting-to-know-you part of relationships, so…
Oh, okay. I understand.
Okay, let's just get it over and done with.
Okay, uh…
Right, so, uh…
My grandfather invented the flash-freezing process.
So I come from grotesque money,
but I got away from it by getting three masters degrees.
Uh, I've been divorced twice.
Uh, one was a Secretary of State, and the other one was a sport fisherman.
Uh, I have slept with two former presidents.
I speak four languages, and I own two Monets.
Wow.
Two former presidents. Wow.
-What, my turn? -[chuckles] Yeah.
Oh. All right. My father was a middle school geography teacher.
My mother, she cut hair out of the kitchen.
Uh, about two years ago, our family dog, JoJo, died,
which was really, really emotional.
I can't remember crying that much ever.
And, um…
I finally got my, uh, Star Wars poster signed by Mark Hamill.
It's in the garage. It's… So, yeah.
Okay, good.
That's done.
Where are we gonna go for dinner tonight?
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
He makes me to lie down in green pastures.
He leads me beside the quiet waters. He restores my soul.
Not since D-Day have we seen such a mass mobilization
of unions and resources for such a noble task.
One cannot help but be moved by the bravery, ingenuity,
and sacrifice on display here.
Okay, here we go, everyone. Let's stay sharp.
[whispers] I just want you to know, this is the most propulsive thing
that's ever happened to me. Thank you.
What's the holdup, you guys? What are you waiting on?
Come on, motherfuckers, let's light this fucking firecracker, huh?
Think I got all day?
Commander Drask, this is your president speaking.
Your nation thanks you.
Your planet thanks you.
And God and I thank you.
[Drask] Listen, the only thanks I need is a shot of Jack Daniels.
-[laughter] -And a couple DUIs to magically go away.
This is Mission Control. All indicators are coming up green.
This is a final warning to control the launchpad.
Your discovery led to this mission and our chance to save Earth.
I give you…
the honor.
Thank you.
[clears throat] Thank you, Madam President.
Citizens of planet Earth,
everything is theoretically impossible
until it is done.
And with that, we are go for launch.
Yes.
-[Jason] That's fire. -Thank you.
[Jason] It was lit.
[Peter] Hey, everyone, mind if I join?
-Hello. -[Orlean] Hello, Peter. Hi.
Hi. Oh, Brie, you look fabulous. As always.
Is he allowed to be in here?
Yeah, he's a Platinum Eagle level donor to the campaign. He has full clearance.
[man on radio] Launch mission array.
[sighs] Molly kicking in right now. Timed that shit perfect.
Ten, nine, eight… -seven, six, five, four… -[all cheering]
Three…
Thank God!
[Oglethorpe] We didn't lose any satellites.
Margin of error was for two to malfunction.
Hey, Madam President, may I have a word with you outside for a moment, please?
Oh, my God.
Mission success probability is already increased to 81%.
[man] Outstanding.
-[Peter] Janie, now! -[gasps]
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Peter, I didn't mean…
[Drask] And a big hello to that beautiful blue ball down there we all call home.
All those proud white folks working hard.
God bless you.
Just a different generation. Yeah.
I also wanna say hello to all the Indians out there.
Both kinds. You know, the ones with the elephants and the ones with the bow and arrows.
Hey, why haven't you guys ever teamed up? [chuckles] How cool would that be, huh?
I wanna say hello to all the gays out there.
-Commander, booster ejection is imminent. -Huh?
-Let's keep comm on mission. -Oh. Roger that.
[man on radio] Separation confirmed. -Separation confirmed. -Whoo!
-Separation confirmed. -Whoo!
Was that French?
Yes, it is. It means, "the angels soar to the heavens." It's, um…
It's from a 14th-century poem I studied in Dartmouth.
And just watching this, it just made me think of it,
and think of you.
God, I can't…
Can't…
[men chanting] Go! Go! Go! -[groans] -[laughter]
I think I probably should go to the [bleep] hospital and see what they…
[people on video] Launch challenge!
[people chanting on video] Go! Go! Go!
Everyone, I have just received
some critical information concerning our mission.
Looks like it's turning around.
No, it's not. It's a course correction.
It's pretty standard.
I was in the Navy.
Nope. It's turning around.
[reporter] Seems to be some confusion here amongst the crowd,
but I'm not gonna lie to you.
This reporter is at a loss for words right now.
It's definitely turning around.
I'm looking straight at it.
Drask's ship is definitely turning around.
Does anyone know what the fuck just happened?
It's still locked.
I just don't… I don't understand what could've happened.
I mean, the mission was working, right? Everything was on track.
Yeah. I mean, it could've been anything, uh…
Guidance system could've malfunctioned, uh, nuke destabilized, myriad of things.
Who was that guy that walked into the Situation Room? He looked familiar.
That was Peter Isherwell, CEO of BASH, and the third richest human ever.
He's the guy that, uh, bought the Gutenberg Bible and lost it.
[Jason] Sorry to keep you waiting.
Things are, uh, extremely fluid.
Dr. Randall, you are now the Chief Science Advisor to the White House.
What?
As such, you need to attend an emergency Cabinet meeting
where you will be debriefed.
What about us?
You do not have clearance for this, sweetheart. Don't trip.
Got you some crackers, some waters.
You don't need to throw it on the floor.
Gonna be three, four hours, tops.
Here, Kate. I don't know why he threw 'em down. Here.
What if we have to go to the bathroom?
We'll lay out some newspaper for you. Grab you a can of Febreze.
[Oglethorpe] Short, sweet and simple science. I'll be back. All right. Come on.
I'll be back. All right. Come on.
[Oglethorpe] Science tells the truth, Randall.
Fuck. Do you wanna come?
Yeah.
[Orlean] Ladies and gentlemen, what we thought,
what the world thought was an impending and terrifying danger,
turns out to be an astonishing opportunity.
Our allies are very confused and demanding answers--
Well, tell 'em to wait.
According to the most recent spectrometer readings of Comet Dibiasky,
made by the astrogeologists at BASH Cellular,
we've discovered something.
Something truly miraculous.
Peter. Peter?
-Oh, thank you, Janie. -[chuckles]
As, uh… As some of you may know,
the most valuable minerals in the world
are fast becoming those that are deployed
in the manufacture of cell phones and, uh, computers.
Yttrium, terbium, osmium, dysprosium, on and on and on.
We're running short.
Uh, and the problem is exacerbated, of course,
because China has her big panda paw firmly on almost all the mines
that produce these valuable rare Earth assets.
So you can imagine. [laughing]
Wow!
Just how happy we were at BASH
when our astrogeologists discovered
and then determined that this comet, hurtling towards us from deep space,
actually contains at least $32 trillion of these critical materials.
Critical to technology.
If we're to proceed--
I'm sorry. Is that why you aborted this entire mission,
is because you're trying to mine the comet for rare minerals?
[Orlean] I think we should hold all questions until the end of the presentation,
and you might find that your questions are answered.
Yes, Madam President.
When you… When the other metals are factored in, the comet actually contains
almost $140 trillion worth of assets.
[Jason] Buck-forty trilli.
-[Orlean] Yeah… -[laughter]
What do these trillions of dollars even matter if we're all gonna die--
[woman] I was about to ask the same question, Janie.
Why weren't we consulted?
All due respect, Madam President…
Oh, no! What if we're rich and we're safe?
[Kate] I've gone over it again and again and again in my head
and I still can't make sense of it.
He's a three-star general. He works at the Pentagon.
Why would he charge us for free snacks?
One time, I met Sting,
and I swear to God, he farted right in front of me.
Didn't break eye contact and didn't even say "excuse me."
And the thing is, he actually pulled it off. [chuckles]
'Cause I still found him to be quite charming.
[whispering] Guys, we have to talk. Come on, let's go. Come on, now.
It's insane. Like, completely insane.
[Kate] It will never work.
I had the exact same reaction.
This is a nine-kilometer-wide planet-killer we're talking about,
not roaming charges.
Look, I… I was confused and outraged that they turned this mission around too,
but they've got Gary Talcamont from Stanford
and Lisa Inez from Princeton on their team.
I mean, this is next-generation cutting-edge technology.
Obviously, one giant comet is a major and existential, uh, threat to our planet,
but 30 smaller meteoroids, we can handle.
Our BEADS, that stands for BASH, uh, Explore and Acquire Drones,
that you see here,
attach themselves to the comet
and scan it with nanotechnology
developed by Nobel Prize-winning scientist,
Dr. Gary Talcamont.
And then we immediately deploy, don't we?
Nobel and Polonsky prize-winning scientist
Dr. Inez's micro-targeted, quantum fission, uh, explosives.
You see, deep into the object…
Dr. Inez, would you like to explain what's happening?
Thank you, Peter.
We've been developing phase-fission reactions
in the CERN particle accelerator
that can splinter the comet into smaller pieces
with breathtaking accuracy.
These segments are then steered and decelerated by each BEAD
into the Pacific Ocean for reclamation by waiting US Navy ships.
And when these… Thank you.
And when these treasures from heaven are claimed,
poverty as we know it, social injustice, loss of biodiversity,
all these multitudes of problems
are just gonna become relics of the past
and humanity is gonna stride through the Pillars of Boaz and Jachin naked
into the the glory of a golden age…
And is this nanotech work peer-reviewed?
Well, I haven't reviewed the data, but it's been modeled.
Has any of this been peer-reviewed?
Nope.
Interplanetary, interstellar,
intergalactic existence for the human race.
[Orlean] Your mouth to God's ear.
I understand the wealth that they can extract from this comet,
it can end world hunger.
-[Oglethorpe] Oh, I see. -[Kate laughing]
-Why are you laughing? -[Oglethorpe] That's true. No, I see.
So that's the pretty little bow they're putting around this line of bullshit.
I bet they'll say freedom and puppies too.
-All right. -Yeah.
You want me to quit the mission? I'll quit the mission. That's fine.
But you have to understand, this is now beyond our control.
They have all the power.
So who do you want in the actual room to make sure
this whole thing doesn't turn out to be a complete goddamn disaster?
Jason Orlean? You want Jason Orlean in that room? Huh?
I have news for you. It's already a complete disaster.
They're talking about letting a comet the size of a mountain
hit the planet to jack up a cell phone company's stock!
You better take that down about four or five notches now.
Were you yelling about that mission? Why were you talking about cell phones?
My friend was just theorizing as to what's going on.
We're confused too.
That's an awfully official-looking White House badge you got there.
I don't know why I have this on.
Listen, just tell us what's going on.
I got three scared kids at home. Just tell us something.
I understand. I wish I could share information, but--
We're people just like you. We deserve to know!
They're right. They deserve to know.
Do you really wanna know what's going on?
-[woman] Yeah. -[man] Please.
-[Oglethorpe] Kate, don't. Kate. -[Mindy] Kate.
They found a bunch of gold and diamonds and rare shit on the comet.
So they're gonna let it hit the planet
to make a bunch of rich people even more disgustingly rich!
[officer] No camera!
…everything I could, they won't listen.
[Kate] Surprise, surprise.
Now, I'm starting to think you just like riling people up.
I'm so sorry, Kate. Really, I am.
[Kate] Oh, Randall. God.
Where's Brie Evantee?
Shouldn't you two be playing footsie in a restaurant
Shouldn't you two be playing footsie in a restaurant that only serves cubes and foam?
Well, she ain't wrong. You did lose the thread in a big way.
And what do you suggest we do? An online petition, huh?
You want to hold… Get a mob and hold up picket signs?
You wanna overthrow the government? I mean, look at this.
[Kate] I can't! My head is in a bag!
[agent] Sorry, Dr. Mindy. White House wants her off the grid.
-Come on, now. Look-- -[agent] Now.
[Kate] Wait. What does that mean? What the hell does that mean?
-What does "off the grid" mean? -[Mindy] Hey, Kate.
Oh, gosh. Kate! Are you okay?
Teddy, come on! What choice do I have here?
A man's always got choices, Randall!
Sometimes you just gotta choose the good one!
[man] Miss Katelyn Dibiasky,
the charges against you are violation of national security secrets,
inciting a riot, and destruction of private property owned by Bojo Mambo's Shrimp LLC.
What? I didn't--
However, the Attorney General is willing to not pursue prosecution
if you will agree to the following:
"The suspension of all public media appearances
and incendiary language relating to Comet Dibiasky and BASH Cellular."
Fine. Give it to me. I don't give a shit anymore.
Mom. Dad. [sniffles] I'm so glad to be home.
Unlock the door.
No politics. None.
What are you talking about?
Your dad and I are for the jobs the comet will provide.
The divisions in this country are bad enough.
We don't want more of that in our house.
-Slow down, kids. -[boy] Sorry, Mom.
I worry about my kids and their future.
Sure, the jobs the comet's gonna create sound great.
What if it's not safe?
Right now, millions of you are having these same doubts and questions
about the approaching comet.
That is why BASH Cellular
in conjunction with the United States Government
is creating a new hotline, free of charge, to answer all of your questions.
And who knows? Maybe, just maybe, one of our scientists…
Thank you, Sharon. Makes me feel so much better.
…can be that friend we all need to lean on during uncertain times.

[Brie laughing] So, I thought he was the ambassador. I was just flattering him.
[chuckling] Well, he was a waiter. Now he's got an ego the size of Texas.
Oh, my God.
June, what, uh… What are you doing here, sweetie?
Had a feeling something was going on and just…
[Mindy] Well, you know, we're discussing important business.
-That's what we're doing. -Oh, yeah, that's really very important.
Oh, can we just skip past this part, please? Where you get to feel self-righteous
and we put our tails between our legs. It is just so boring.
[sarcastically] Oh, it's "so boring"?
You wanna skip the part where you feel bad for screwing my husband?
Oh… No, I don't feel bad.
Randall and I are having a wonderful time. So, I think the question is,
do we keep having a wonderful time or does he go back with you to Wisconsin?
Or Montana.
-Michigan? -Michigan.
You know, um… she is actually right.
That's the only question. So…
[Mindy] Well, June, sweetie…
[breathing heavily] Sometimes in life things are, you know, they're complicated and they just--
[Mrs. Mindy] Oh, okay.
Oh, that was fast, um…
Well, before I go, um,
let me just give you some instructions
on how to take care of Randall.
Yeah, here's the Xanax he takes for his panic attacks.
Oh, gosh.
Here's the Zoloft he takes for the crashing depressions.
-Not so much recently. Okay, you know-- -Oh! Oh, good for you. Great.
-Uh, this is for his blood pressure. -Ow.
-Restless leg syndrome, that's a fun one. -God.
Oh. Appetite suppressant to counteract the weight gain from his other meds.
And, uh, for America's sexiest scientist, a bottle of goddamn Cialis!
Ow! Gosh.
Goodbye. Goodbye, Randall.
I guess I'll just tell your sons
that Dad's fucking the lady on our television.
June, I…
I really thought for a second that was gonna work out.
People, they wanna manage the comet to create jobs.
Thirty-seven percent don't want the comet to hit.
That's actually down by three points.
And 23%, they don't think there's a comet at all,
and that number is way up.
Not Bitcoin, RatCoin. RatCoin.
I'd like to buy these sunglasses.
You that girl from live TV who said we're all gonna die?
No. What's your purchase?
What the fuck?
-Yeah, that's you. It's definitely you. -Yep, that's me.
Holy shit. You're a stone-cold legend. Word is bond.
I got a picture of you on my board.
Picture on his fucking board.
[Kate] That's great. What's your purchase?
If you don't have one, get out of line and make room for other customers.
Can I touch your hair in a non-sexual way?
-Get the fuck away from me. -Oh, dude, have some… Um…
Call Diogo, he'll freak out. Will you say hi to my friend?
Dude, he's obsessed with you. We love you. We don't like…
Can't stand Orlean, either.
What's up? Yo, check out…
Yo, shut the fuck up. Check out who we're with.
-Yo, bro! What up? -What up?
I mean, we have a purchase, but we don't have payment,
which is a metaphor on…
-Cash? -[man] Also, Phillip, I've been told…
-Right. -…that you wrote a book
about your past relationship with Kate Dibiasky.
Funny you should say that, I'm working on that now.
It's gonna be called A Brush With The Devil, and it's, uh…
You calling security or something, with your eyes?
No. You're free to go.
-[man] That sounds terrible. -Just like that?
You don't give a shit, do you?
Sure, I do.
I care about DrinkMo's guarantee of quality service.
Well, we don't give a shit either.
Not one single shit.
We hang and board behind the abandoned Burger Crown from 7:00 to whenever.
Yeah, we do.
You should come hang. If you're not a fucking pussy.
[Phillip] Oh, you know, it's me…
-Fuck. Okay. Thanks. -…and a bottle of scotch.
It's a joke. But also…
[Peter] Okay, let me introduce you
uh, to mankind's savior, BASH Explore and Acquire Drone.
It's incredible.
It's incredible, isn't it?
I call this one Primo, the first. [laughing]
It's like my first child.
Primo, my boy. It's your father, Cronos. [laughing]
Don't be shy. Come on. You're gonna be a god in the sky.
Are you at all concerned about the sync on the BEAD explosions?
Oh, Doctor. There are always questions and fears, and…
I have a report here from a Dr. Inez.
-If you'd just take a look at this study. -Oh, thanks.
Listen, a lot of my colleagues,
they've either been removed or resigned from this project,
apparently for asking too many questions about this mission here.
So I just wanna make sure that you're…
That you're open to the scientific peer-review process
and you're not approaching this mission like a businessman.
-You know? That-- -What did you say?
-I wanna know if you're-- -Did you call me a businessman?
-You do own a corporate-- -You think I'm just a businessman?
Do you think you know me, Doctor?
Business?
This is evolution. This is evolution of the human species.
-What are you doing bringing this… -[Orlean] Well--
You know that BASH has over 40 million data points on you,
on every decision you have made since 1994, Doctor?
I… I know when you have colon polyps months before your doctor does.
You got four or five at the moment actually.
You know, they're not of concern, but I'd have a checkup as soon as you can.
But much more importantly than that, I know what you are. I know who you are.
My algorithms have determined eight fundamental consumer profile types.
You are a lifestyle idealist.
You think you're motivated by beliefs, high ethical beliefs.
But you just run towards pleasure and away from pain.
Like a… Like a field mouse.
[Mindy] I'm just trying to…
I just wanna make sure that the science is sound on this project.
I hope you understand--
Our algorithms can even predict how you'll die.
To 96… 96.5% accuracy.
I looked you up after we met.
Your death was so unremarkable and boring.
I can't remember the details, apart from one thing.
You're gonna die alone.
Alone.
If you'll excuse me, Madam President. I've got some work to do.
[Orlean] What the hell are you doing? -My God. -I was trying to do my job.
-My God. -I was trying to do my job.
You are just so lucky that Peter adores you.
You're with the grown-ups now, Randall.
I can't even follow this shit anymore!
-[music playing on speakers] -[indistinct chatter]
BASH got Orlean to pay the Chilean government, if I'm correct,
$90 billion to let the tsunami hit off the coast of the country.
That sound right to you?
[man 3] Isherwell built an underground bunker
[man 3] Isherwell built an underground bunker for him and all his executives.
No, I heard that they built an escape ship.
You guys, the truth is way more depressing.
They're not even smart enough to be as evil as you're giving them credit for.
-What? -No.
Fuck! You're driving me fucking crazy, Kate. [chuckles nervously]
Fuck it. We're all gonna die.

[Jack] …movie will be released
the day that some believe Comet Dibiasky will impact the planet.
And the early word is it's already a classic, Brie.
[Brie] Oh, yes. Well, and what a stellar cast.
-Devin. Yeah. -I love Devin Peters.
He's great. Everything he does.
-What's it called again? -[Jack] It's called Total Devastation.
-It cost $300 million to make. -[Brie] Whoo!

[Jack] Tell me about it. And my friend Farley, he saw it.
-He said it's a ton of fun. That's right. -Well, Farley likes it.
All right, well, what Farley says goes.
But, uh, first,
and yes, you can tell from my smile…
[chuckles] Stop it.
That America's sexiest scientist is here. Dr. Randall. Welcome.
Dr. Randall, how are you, sir?
[sighs] I'm--  I'm good. I'm gooder than good.
All right. So, Randall, we're hearing that there is no comet,
or that there is a comet but it's a good thing or maybe it's a bad thing.
We are so confused. [chuckles]
So, could you please help us out here, you know, oh, wise scientist?
Well, first and foremost, Brie, um… [sniffs] …there most certainly is a comet.
[Brie] All right.
And we know that there is a comet because we have the data.
There has been growing concern within the scientific community as of late.
You see, the peer-review process is absolutely essential…
-If BASH's stock… -…for us to get to the facts of… Yes?
If BASH's stock is any indicator,
we don't have to worry about the peer review.
It is going gangbusters.
And full disclosure. I bought as many shares as I could.
I advise you to do the same.
You are such a shameless capitalist.
Said the woman who will be in the brand-new hot tub on my back deck
-when I put it in from the stock. -You know me too well.
That's right.
Dr. Randall, you sure you're okay? You want a glass of water…
I don't feel so good.
[Brie] So I think we'll go to commercial break--
No, Please, Brie. Don't cut away. Let me say something.
-Okay. -You came to the right place.
We like to say things.
Would you please just stop being so [bleep] pleasant?
I'm sorry, but not everything needs to sound so goddamn clever
or charming or likeable all the time.
Sometimes we need to just be able to say things to one another.
We need to hear things.
Look, let's establish, once again,
that there is a huge comet headed towards Earth.
And the reason we know that there is a comet
is because we saw it.
We saw it with our own eyes using a telescope.
I mean, for God's sake, we took a fucking picture of it!
What other proof do we need?
And if we can't all agree at the bare minimum
that a giant comet the size of Mount Everest
hurtling its way towards planet Earth is not a fucking good thing,
then what the hell happened to us?
I mean, my God, how do-- How do we even talk to each other?
What've we… What've we done to ourselves? How do we fix it?
We should have deflected this comet when we had the fucking chance,
but we didn't do it. I don't know why we didn't do it.
And now they're actually firing scientists like me
for speaking out, for opposing them.
And I'm sure many of the people out there
aren't even gonna listen to what I just said
'cause they have their own political ideology,
but I… assure you,
I am not on one side or the other.
I'm just telling you the fucking truth.
This would be a good time to establish
that Isherwell and the president have both said
that there's benefits to be--
Right, well, the president of the United States is fucking lying!
Look, I'm just like all of you.
I hope to God, I hope to God that this president knows what she's doing.
I hope she's got us all taken care of, but the truth is,
I think this whole administration
has completely lost their fucking mind!
And I think we're all gonna die!
[softly] Look, I just wanna go home.
[sighs] I just wanna go home. I just wanna go home more than anything.
But if there is one thing,
one thing that I pray… that I pray that all of you hear from what I have just said,
is that all of us, all of us…
Why'd you do that?
I really liked you and I despise most people.
[Mindy] You know, I… I really thought I loved you.
Really?
Wow.
[sighs] That's wild.
-Yeah. -[car door opens]
[man] Ma'am, you need to go. We gotta get this man off the grid.
[Mindy] You still there?
No.
[Kate] Well, maybe he just gets off on the power, you know,
like any kind of power.
It's like he knew eventually that I was gonna find out that the snacks were free.
-Right. -You know what I mean?
-Yeah. -So it was just like a power play.
Yeah, guys are weird.
I'm starting to think that all this "end of the world" stuff is bullshit.
It's not.
It's definitely happening. I've seen it.
I feel like if God wanted to destroy the Earth, He would destroy the Earth.
You believe in God?
Yeah, I mean, my parents raised me Evangelical,
and I hate them, but I found my own way to it.
My own relationship.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't advertise it, though.
I won't tell anybody. [chuckles] I think it's kind of sweet.
-Wanna make out? -Yeah, why not?
Can you not say "why not"? It makes me feel like you don't want it.
It's shitty.
-Sure, whatever. -That's better.
-Oh, my God, that's it. -What? What?
-That's the comet. -What? Where?
-[Yule] Where? Uh-huh. -Well, that's the Big Dipper.
-That's Venus. That's the North Star. -Uh-huh.
-Well, what is that? -Oh, shit.
What the hell?
What?
There it is.
There you are.
There you are.
Is anyone else seeing this? That's it.
That's it. That's the comet. Look! It's right there.
-That's, you know, kinda scary. -Oh! Exactly.
-Dr. Mindy. -[Mindy] Kate.
Doc, you can see it.
I… I'm looking at it right now too. It's unbelievable. It's…
It's horrific and it's… And it's beautiful at the same time.
-Oh, my God. -[laughing]
We've been trying to tell you.
We tried to tell you this whole time. It's right there. It's…
It's right there, Kate.
[Kate] Where are you?
I'm in Lansing, Michigan
trying to fix things with June, but she won't talk to me.
-Where are you? -[Yule] What the fuck?
[Kate] I…
[Mindy] I'm gonna come find you, okay?
Well, I'm in Illinois. I could be ready by tomorrow.
-Dearest Father… -Yeah, I'm--
…as a sinner I come to You for Your grace and guidance…
[Mindy] They're finally seeing it.
They're finally seeing it.
There it is!
Go outside into your yard, onto a roof, onto your sidewalk,
and just look up into the sky.
The star's gonna appear fuzzy. It's got a long streak coming off of it.
That's the comet's tail.
It's real and it's coming.
If anyone tells you any different, they're full of shit.
Just look up into the sky.
It's a fucking fact.
-We have proof. -Just look up.
Guys, please just look up, okay? Screw the manatees and just look up.
[both] Just look up.
-[all] Just look up! -Just look up! Just look up!
Just look up!
Dr. Mindy, the president's plan to save Earth
and make it so we can all have a home is going to work, right?
Every single man, woman and child on this planet is going to die.
-I don't like him. He makes me sad. -I'm sorry about that.
-This is not what we rehearsed. -Kids, listen.
You tell your parents that President Orlean and Isherwell
are sociopaths and fascists!
And do you know why they want you to look up?
Do you know why?
'Cause they want you to be afraid.
They want you to look up
because they are looking down their noses at you.
They think they're better than you.
-[hip-hop tune plays] -[chanting] Don't look up!
They wanna rob you of your freedom, and that's a fact!
[chanting] Don't look up!
The US president, Orlean…
-[crowd clamoring] -[man yelling] Just look up!
…has not included India or any other nation in the world
to be a part of this mission.
This dude is a known pornographer named Kip…
Don't listen to that dumbfuck.
The United Nations have been considering its own deflective mission.
-[laughing] -Just look up, for fuck's sake!
[woman] Now I know a lot of Hollywood is supporting the Just Look Up movement,
but I haven't seen a pin like that.
Yeah, this pin points both up and down.
Because I think, as a country, we need to stop arguing
and virtue signaling. Just get along.
-[woman] That is so refreshing. -Hmm.
[woman] I think we're all tired of the politics.
Yeah, yeah. Well…
That's why we made Total Devastation.
It's for everyone. You know? It's a popcorn movie.
You keep your eye on the road ahead, you put your head down.
And you put one foot in front of the other,
step by step.
[Orlean] Day by day.
-[people chanting] Don't look up! -Don't!
So we wanna say something loud and clear.
There is no safe way to bring this comet back to Earth
and exploit it for profit. It cannot be done!
Nations of the world, defy Orlean and BASH!
Launch your own nuclear deflection mission now and save this planet!
And now, uh, there's Riley Bina with her special guest.
-[people cheering] -I forgot the name. Thank you.

Hey, good afternoon, Adam. What do I owe the pleasure of this call?
What time?
Well, uh… Well, thank you for calling.
Yeah.
What?
What?
Orlean and BASH cut Russia, India, and China
out of the rights for the minerals.
So they tried their own joint deflection mission,
but, uh… approximately 40 minutes ago,
there was a massive explosion detected at the Russian's Baikonur launch complex.
So it looks like the mission failed.
That's it?
What do you mean, "that's it?"
Teddy?
Right?
There is still the BASH mission. It's all we have now.
[Mindy] Fuck!
These Just Look Uppers
want millions of illegal Chileans to come across the border.
[all chanting] Don't look up.
The hell is that?
Fucking lied to us.
-The president just texted me. -[glass shattering] -"Don't trip. It's all good. Don't trip." -[people shouting and booing]
Hey, now.
You cut my face, you fucking rednecks!
[Yule] Man, there hasn't been a car in, like, an hour.
[Mindy] Yep. Everyone's watching the BASH launch.
What are we doing again?
I told you. We're, uh… We're gonna go buy some groceries.
The Mills Brothers. Great band. You know, Duke Ellington found this band.
I think they were originally called the Four Kings of Harmony.
"Till Then," this is the song. It's about, uh…
"Till Then," this is the song. It's about, uh… It's about soldiers going off to World War II
and thinking about home.
Listen to this part.
"Although there are oceans we must cross and mountains that we must climb…"
"I know that every gain must have a loss."
"So pray that our loss is nothing but time."
-[Yule] Okay, I gotta ask you something. -What?
Dr. Mindy, can I be vulnerable in your car?
[Mindy] Yeah, go ahead.
I've never met anyone like you
and I feel a connection to you on a level that…
I don't know, I haven't felt with anyone else,
and going out on a limb,
but would you want to spend more time together?
-[song stops playing] -Maybe even get engaged or something?
-Wow. -[Yule] Are you laughing?
-No? -[Kate] I'm smiling.
-Well, sure. -[Mindy] This is sweet.
-Why not? -This is pretty sweet.
[Orlean hesitates] And you read the tea leaves for Dr. Mindy.
-You showed him the algorithm. -[Peter] Oh, yeah.
[Orlean] You really shook him with that information.
-How he was gonna die. -[Peter] Yeah, it is shaking.
It got me so excited to know about my own death.
I don't think I wanna know. Yes, I do. I wanna to know.
You're gonna be eaten by a Bronteroc. We don't know what it means.
-A what? -A Bronteroc.
-Oh. -Okay, people, we have clear skies.
And we are a go for the BEAD launch.
Madam President?
Citizens of planet Earth. Now…
Look at this, Kate. They have wild salmon.
Look at the difference between that and the farm-raised stuff.
You see how that looks just… I don't know. Looks fake, right?
Hey, why don't you go find some, uh…
What are the little potatoes called, the tiny ones?
-Fingerling potatoes? -Yeah.
-I fucking love fingerling potatoes. -Let's get finger…
Do you wanna say something too?
That was beautiful. Yeah.
What up, world? Jason Orlean, uh, Chief of Staff, United States.
I've been noticing a lot of prayers recently for people during this time
and I commend that, um,
but I also wanna give a prayer for stuff.
There's dope stuff, like material stuff, like sick apartments and watches,
and cars, um, and clothes and shit
and cars, um, and clothes and shit that could all go away and I don't wanna see that stuff go away.
that could all go away and I don't wanna see that stuff go away.
So I'm gonna say a prayer for that stuff. Amen.
[man on TV] Just a quiet trepidation among this much smaller crowd.
I can hear the sounds of some people praying.
[Peter] Okay, Anderson, let's go get it.
Yes, sir. Here we go, people. Ten.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four…
Hey.
Hi.
We, uh, got some groceries.
Yo, what was that?
-We lost BEAD number 12. -[alarm blaring]
[man] BEAD number 22 failed to launch.
It's fine. It's fine.
We had anticipated a margin for error. Everything is fine.
I was hoping we could, um, have a family dinner.
[Evan and Marshall] Hey, Dad.
-Hey, guys. Hey. -Hey.
What do you say?
Yeah.
-[Mindy] Thank you. -Yeah.
-This is, uh… This is Kate. -Oh, hi.
-Hello. Hi, Kate. -Let me grab those bags.
-Nice to meet you. I'm Yule. -Yule.
I'm FirePuma142 on Twitch. You game?
It's really doubtful she knows.
-You're right. -Who said I game?
I… I got these for you.
Thank you. That's really sweet, honey.
I'm so sorry. You have no idea.
-I really am. -[sighs] I know. I know.
-I've missed you. -I missed you so much.
When we dated in college, I fucked Aaron Tran.
Yeah, so, uh…
-That is really good. -Really good, right?
-Hey, everybody. -Hey!
-Sorry I'm late, but not empty-handed. -Hey, my friend.
Evan, Marshall, June, this is Dr. Oglethorpe.
BEADs have approached optimal escape velocity
and now approaching Comet Dibiasky and are ready for attachment mode.
-[alarm blaring] -Uh… Okay. All right.
Eight and 27 are lost due to lateral control malfunction.
Okay, so, now… Now, Peter…
Peter, we're six drones down. Is this thing still gonna work?
Well, the engineer's assured me that yes, 24 drones is enough.
Well, how many can we lose?
[hesitates] How many more?
We're being told that several of the BEADS have exploded on launch.
-Got the head seat right there. -[Oglethorpe chuckles]
You're way too kind, Randall. Thank you.
[Mindy] Big Doctor.
Do you want more wine?
-Hey, cheers, everyone. Huh? -[Oglethorpe] Cheers.
-Cheers. -[Mindy] Love you.
-Love you. -Thank you so much for having us.
Thank you for being here. -It's so special. -Thank you.
-It's so special. -Thank you.
Commence simultaneous explosive separation stage now.
[Jason] Yo. Yo. Mom.
[Oglethorpe] Beautiful.
-[Mindy] Thank you, pal. -Yeah.
Yeah, it really is. And it's really good to have you home.
[Kate] Dr. Mindy got really famous.
Oh. Oh, yeah, I forgot about that. -That's right. Okay. -[laughter]
Yep, I was on, uh, magazine covers and everything. I know.
-[Kate] You looked great. -I'll take your shots.
-[Mrs. Mindy] I love you. -Love you too.
-[intense music playing] -All right. We need a report.
Need a full status report on the explosive devices.
Get on it. Still waiting for a full status report.
[Anderson] All right.
[breathing heavily] President Qi of China says that the comet is still whole.
We got four misfires and sync was off.
It's still intact.
[Peter] What was that?
We've got four misfires and the sync was off.
Okay. We're all fine. Everyone's fine.
It's gonna be all right. If you'll excuse me. [chuckles]
Nature calls.
I'm just gonna go to the restroom for a moment.
Yes, uh, I think that I should also step out to the restroom for a moment.
-[Jason] Should I… -No, I'll be fine.
Sir, the president.
We need to know what the mission status is.
She's coming right back.
Screw this. I'm going to see my husband.
I'm sorry. I've got a 20-year-old daughter. I've got to go see her.
[man] I'm doin' an 8-ball.
[woman] Oh, shit!
She's coming. She's coming back.
[Orlean] Hello, there's a ship.
In case we were wrong, and clearly, we were wrong.
Of course you've got a ship.
[Orlean] It holds 2,000.
It's state-of-the-art cryo-chambers, and it's set to find
the nearest Earth-like planet in a Goldilocks Zone so…
Hmm. There's room for you and one other. Brie, your wife, your call.
I'm good, but thank you for the offer. You, uh… You have fun with Jason.
Jason?
Oh, shit.
She's coming back.
I'm thankful for that night I fell asleep out in the backyard.
-Woke up face-to-face with a baby deer. -I remember that.
-Yeah. -Yep. It was the best day of my life.
I'm grateful…
[shakily] I'm grateful we tried.
Man, oh, man, did we try.
Well, we're not the most religious here in the Mindy household,
but, um, maybe we should say "amen"? Should we do that?
[Mrs. Mindy] Don't look at me.
[chuckling] I don't know how to… What, you just say, "Amen"? I don't…
-I got this. -Wrap it up?
I got it.
Dearest Father and Almighty Creator…
…we ask for Your grace tonight, despite our pride.
Your forgiveness, despite our doubt.
Most of all, Lord…
we ask for Your love to soothe us through these dark times.
May we face whatever is to come…
…in Your divine will with courage and open hearts of acceptance.
-Amen. -[Oglethorpe] Amen.
Wow. Yule's got some church game.
That was beautiful.
The comet remains intact.
We just never… [sighs]
Of course, there's only one story everyone's talking about tonight.
Topless urgent care centers.
[sighs] Sit.
Or… we can fuck…
…or pray, or…
Honestly, I think I'd just rather drink and…
talk shit about people.
You'll never take me alive!
Look out!
I'm definitely gonna have some more of this apple pie. It's so good.
It's actually store-bought, but you really can't tell.
If I'm to be completely honest, which at this moment, why not?
I actually like the junky taste of store-bought better than homemade.
You gotta be kidding me.
No, I'm not kidding.
You know what? I know what he means. It's like a childhood memory thing.
Nothing is better than homemade, right?
This coffee doesn't taste store-bought. Is it?
I grind my own beans. Yeah.
Yeah, Dad's kind of a coffee nut.
Every time you have coffee, you have to grind your beans?
Randall is very particular about his coffee.
[Kate] I can get that way about tea.
Thing of it is, we really…
We really did have everything, didn't we?
I mean, when you think about it.
♪ When's that Rapture? ♪
[Peter] Hey, oxygen is actually higher than on Earth
by nine percent,
so you might feel a bit light-headed.
And cryo-chambers were 58% successful,
which is much better than anticipated.
Yeah, we only had 47 dead in our section, so…
I think this is gonna work out quite well. Quite well, indeed.
Goodness.
-[gasps] Look at that beautiful animal. -[squawking]
I wonder, are those feathers or are they scale-- -[screams] -[people gasping]
-That's disgusting. -What is that thing?
I believe that's called a Bronteroc.
Uh… Whatever you do, don't pet them.
[Jason] Fuck.
Mom?
Mom!
What's up, y'all?
I'm the last man on Earth.
Shit's all fucked up.
Don't forget to like and subscribe.
Shrouded, like a sin.
Obvious, like a sacred deed.
And sometimes, illogical like fate.
She had a habit of tugging at the sleeves of her pullover
and hiding her fingers under the knitted webs of the wool.
She always sneezed thrice in a row.
The crevice in between her collarbones...
housed a beautiful mole.
However, there was another mole in our lives.
A mole that neither I
nor Octopus saw coming.
No.
-Madam, this isn't allowed inside. -Madam, this isn't allowed inside.
Then I won't go inside either.
Heena!
Happy birthday, Mirza Sahib!
You're looking beautiful.
Liar!
No, it's true.
I'm so sorry.
Your guards have screwed up the gift wrap.
I'm sorry.
I promise, I will kill all of them.
Salaam alaikum.
Walaikum salaam.
Please come.
Hello, sir.
-Two whiskeys on the rocks. -Sure, sir.
This… This is my favorite perfume.
How did you know?
This lovely fragrance has resided in my heart for a long time now.
Liar!
Bigger liar!
Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry.
I have to take this.
-Hello? -Your whiskey on the rocks, ma'am.
Excuse me.
You're already using a perfume.
Maybe you should use this later.
And die alone?
If I use this perfume right now,
we die together.
Am I right?
Octopus!
What's wrong?
The party isn't over yet.
Music!
Enjoy! Enjoy!
Take this.
Mr. Handa, any update?
KM, you're still here?
Leave me, Kutty!
-KM, just stop! He'll die. Stop it! -Kutty!
Leave me, Kutty! I'm telling you!
KM! Hey! Handa!
Handa, what happened?
-Take him to the dispensary. Quick. -Okay.
KM, what the hell do you think you're doing?
You killed her.
You…
Jeev sir, there's a bad news.
It's not me.
It's you who killed her.
Ma'am, a girl's here for a walk-in interview.
Tell her I'm busy.
She said, "If she tells you she's busy, tell her,
'What's wrong with you, my foolish heart?'"
Please wait here.
Thank you.
Salaam alaikum.
I want to work for you.
Sorry?
I have connections everywhere.
NSI. Jamat.
I think you're mistaken.
I'm a counselor.
I know who you are…
Krishna Mehra.
But in our world…
KM.
Smart. "Krishna Mehra is KM."
Shabbir told me you're not stingy like the previous officer.
You pay well.
I don't know a Shabbir.
Well, he isn't really Shabbir anyway.
He definitely didn't give you his real name.
Will you?
Heena.
Heena Rehman.
I work with the accounts department at NSI.
Okay, Heena.
Heena Rehman.
Nice meeting you.
It contains Brigadier Mirza's movement schedule for the next 15 days.
I know you're following him.
Sorry.
I somehow always sneeze thrice.
Wanna frisk me?
Why are you doing this?
I hate Mirza.
He wants to take us back to the Stone Age.
He's an ISI puppet.
And?
I need money, for my father's treatment.
I can't recruit you.
Why?
We're not supposed to trust walk-ins.
But do you have a choice?
Do you?
Many.
"Many"?
Mirza's going after your men,
and you're sitting on the sidelines.
Remember the 814 hijack?
If Delhi doesn't respond soon,
you'll lose your men to Beijing.
I have three replies.
You just need to ask the right question…
KM.
Police officials are investigating
what seems to be a coordinated triple blast
in the offices of Jamat in Dhaka, Chittagong, and Rajshahi.
As the video shows, this entire building in Dhaka has been demolished
and the exact number of casualties are unknown.
Even though initial estimates…
Did you like my hat-trick?
Now will you recruit me, KM?
I'm not home.
Well, you are. You're just not in your body.
KM, I need you.
Really?
You're the only one I trust.
Bullshit!
You fucking sent her on a suicide mission…
No.
…and didn't tell me?
KM, this wasn't a suicide mission.
We had an evacuation plan in place.
But somebody betrayed us.
We have a mole in the agency.
Ravi Mohan.
He's our prime suspect.
We noticed in our routine surveillance
that his lifestyle doesn't match his income.
To confirm our doubt,
we bypassed all the rules and norms of the agency
and decided to bug his office.
Good morning, sir.
And unfortunately, we were right.
He makes photocopies of the agency's top-secret documents
and takes them out of his office.
Good night, sir!
Bye!
We kept the family also under surveillance.
Charu, I'm leaving, sweetheart.
Don't forget your umbrella!
Yeah, I've got it.
We suspect his wife is an accomplice.
And she could be his courier as well.
-Were you fighting in school? -No, not me…
She regularly takes her son swimming at the Zaire Club after school.
Zaire Club, which is always full of foreign diplomats.
It's an ideal place for delivery.
She's quite friendly,
especially with the diplomats of the Pakistani embassy.
The day before Operation Octopus, Ravi went to a shady theater in Paharganj.
Wow! This is from The Metric, right?
-You mean The Matrix? -Shut up!
Ms. Chandni-- Sorry.
I can throw him out of class if you wish.
No, thank you. I'll…
Triple two, triple seven, double three, eight.
Yeah, Mom.
How are you?
-Yeah. -Double three,
three, eight, triple five, double two.
Yeah.
Yeah…
-Bye. -Yeah.
Yeah, Damini's alright.
All right.
Yeah, I'll see you soon, Mom.
Hey! Pay up!
-Hey! -What the…
-Call for an ambulance… -Brother!
Should we call for an ambulance?
-Was he with you? -Do you know him?
The message was coded.
By the time we decoded it,
it was too late.
What was the message?
"Perfume bottle."
Why haven't you arrested him yet?
Come on, KM.
Ravi's just a puppet.
Just a pawn.
And in our game,
the puppeteer is more important than the puppet.
There are many officers in the agency.
Why me?
I owe you this opportunity.
"Opportunity"?
Now?
For what?
To avenge Octopus.
Power can corrupt an angel.
And absolute power will corrupt him absolutely.
Right now,
he's just an egg of a venomous snake.
He will strike if he's let into this world.
So, before he gets out of his hole,
we must crush him!
Hey, he's here!
-Hey, congratulations! -Thank you.
-Well done, son. -Thank you, sir.
I'm so proud of you!
Viku!
Hey!
Is the play over?
You know what?
Draping a bloody sari, it takes a lifetime.
And then, I had to deal with a flat tire.
I got the watchman to change the tire,
broke every signal I possibly could, and crash-landed at this venue.
And I was just ten minutes late!
But they didn't let me in.
So sorry, Viku!
It's okay, Ma.
I'll go get changed.
You learned how to drape a sari?
Not at all!
So?
An auntie from the neighborhood helped me.
I didn't know…
you are into older women now.
Shut up.
Ma, that's enough.
-Some more. -No, no. I'm full!
-All right. -Please…
Okay.
You look so beautiful in a sari, Ma.
You should wear it more often.
-Yup. -Okay.
So, Dad, tell me one thing.
How could you let go of such a beauty?
Made a mistake, buddy.
Who did?
I need to go.
At least finish your food?
It's really important, Shashank. I need to go to the office.
On a Sunday?
On a Sunday!
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry!
Next-to-next Sunday,
this will be the last time I'll be playing Brutus.
-So, don't make any excuses. -No.
-Sure? -Sure! I promise!
Are you sure?
-Don't be late, Ma. Please! -Thousand percent!
-Everyone's here? -Yes, ma'am.
Sorry, sir.
In disguise?
Family dinner.
We've got permission to bug his house.
You will run the mission.
What should we call it?
Brutus.
"Brutus"?
Okay.
Operation Brutus will start tonight.
Let's get going.
How much, brother?
Three…
Seventy rupees.
Seventy.
I don't have the change, you can get some curd tomorrow.
Portia has left the building.
But Julius Caesar isn't here yet.
-You're late, Paaji. -Yeah, whatever.
What's the time?
Don't you have a watch?
We've been waiting for ten minutes.
So?
It's okay, Paaji.
No, it's not!
I was on leave! I informed everyone three months ago.
My daughter's come home all the way from America!
We had organized a prayer meet for my granddaughter at the Gurudwara!
I had to leave halfway through!
-Paaji, we don't have the time to fight. -Come on, everyone.
How was your day?!
-Hey! You're running a fever! -Fever?
No swimming today. Come on.
-No, Mommy! -No!
-Kutty sir, Portia! -What?
KM, Portia's back.
Oh, fuck!
She's back.
Hurry up!
Everyone, hurry up!
Jubin, are you done?
Leave. Come on! Hurry up!
And you had jumped into the swimming pool as well!
Right after having ice cream!
Hey!
Why are you so slow?
-What are you doing there? -Kunal, wait a minute.
Jubin, drop it. Leave.
You leave! Leave!
Sorry!
Mom, I want ice cream again!
Be careful!
And no ice cream.
Mommy, open the door!
Please!
Hey, Kunal!
Wait-- Come here.
What's wrong with you?
KM!
What's up, Uncle? Good morning!
Kunal!
Kunal, your tiffin is ready!
Kunal!
Didi, he's in the bedroom.
And I was running through the corridor!
-Kunal! -And then--
-And then… -Then?
Before those three could get to their guns, I just…
And I got back to Delhi the same night, to see you.
Even today, people in Islamabad…
are looking for Masqoor Ali!
-Kunu, time to go. Come on! -Come on.
-Your bus is here. -Come on.
Go on.
Let's go.
-Bye! -It's time!
His inhaler!
Hey, tiger! Go on. I'm coming.
Brutus leaving.
-I'm at the base. You can cover him. -Copy.
KABIR SAYS
One minute.
I'll follow them to the Satsang.
Yeah, you need it.
O' Sage!
O' Sage!
O' Sage!
Colored isn't the Sage's heart
Colored isn't his heart
Colored isn't his heart But colored are the Sage's clothes
Colored isn't his heart But colored are the Sage's clothes
Pierced are his ears And long are his tresses!
Pierced are his ears And long are his tresses!
Long is his beard like that of a goat
Long is his beard like that of a goat
But colored isn't his heart Colored are the Sage's clothes
But colored isn't his heart Colored are the Sage's clothes…
Kabir says, "We try to reach God through external thoughts and actions,
rather than opening our minds."
"We color our clothes,
we pray to stone,
we try and turn away from lust."
"All this is useless!"
"Futile!"
"The mind must be open!"
-All hail… -Yaara ji!
Bless you, Lalita!
All well?
It's been good thanks to your blessings, Yaara ji.
How's the diabetes?
Forget about the how, Yaara ji. Ask me where it is.
The doctor just couldn't believe the report!
You've worked a miracle, Yaara ji!
I did nothing, Lalita!
It's all about meditation.
-Yes. -Never stop that, all right?
No way.
And…
Anulom Vilom.
If you keep doing it regularly,
you'll scare all the diseases away!
How is my scoundrel?
Has he started meditating yet?
He's really busy with work, Yaara ji.
But he really keeps your picture close to his heart.
He does pray to you every day.
Pictures and prayers are futile, Lalita.
In an asana
Sits he in a temple
Leaving the soul behind Prays he to a stone
Leaving the soul behind Prays he to a stone
Colored isn't his heart But colored are the Sage's clothes
Colored isn't his heart But colored are the Sage's clothes
Colored isn't his heart But colored are the Sage's clothes
Colored isn't his heart But colored are the Sage's clothes
See?
-The mountain of files. -God!
Looks like he's in the mood to photocopy the whole bloody office.
Zoom in, Kutty. Here.
I can't read it. Just rotate.
Fuck!
Hi, ma'am.
Where's Ravi?
He's in the garage, ma'am. Parking his car.
He's still in the garage?
-And his wife? -She was on the balcony.
O' my love If you are going to leave anyway
Please stay away
O' my love If you are going to leave anyway
Please stay away
If you're going to just make me cry again
Please stay away
O' my love If you are going to leave anyway
Please stay away
If you're going to…
Just make me cry again
Please stay away
What? You didn't like my singing?
Horrible, you are! So off-key!
Bitch.
Mirza.
What happened?
Nothing.
Your advance.
We'll start training the day after tomorrow.
Training for?
Operation Ghalib.
How long do we need to wait for the crocodile?
Octopus.
Yeah, it's the same. Octopus.
Careful.
-Hello? -May I speak to Heena Rehman?
May I know who's speaking?
I'm calling from her insurance company.
I wanted to discuss her life insurance premium payment.
She hasn't come to work today.
Okay, I'll call again later.
All right.
Who is it?
What are you doing here?!
Have you lost your mind?
How did you find my address?
I don't get paid for selling bakarkhani!
Do you understand?
Why didn't you come to the training?
I think I'm being watched.
Or have you changed your mind?
Who is it?
My friend, Baba. Don't worry.
Which friend? The special friend from Delhi?
That's enough. Shut up.
Old hag.
Operation Ghalib isn't practical.
You guys are rushing it.
Don't you dare…
You don't really trust me, do you?
I don't what?
Trust.
Belief.
Faith.
Are you gonna give me my medicine or shall I go back to sleep?
I'm getting it, Baba. Just give me a minute.
What's he suffering from?
Cancer.
Lung cancer.
Make the rotis.
What have you made?
The map of Bangladesh?
Watch.
Today, I'll teach you how to make rotis.
What did you tell him about me?
Everything.
I haven't told him who you are.
But I've told him…
that you refuse to accept…
who you are.
Come only if you can gently linger…
In my innocent dreams
If you're just going to ruin The little peaceful sleep I get
Please stay away
If you're just going to make me cry again
Please stay away, love…
O' my love…
You!
No, a thief.
Ravi, how did you buy such an expensive necklace?
I bought it at a store.
Ravi?
Where's this money coming from?
I'm spying for another country.
Please.
Those diamond earrings, and now this necklace…
Tell me the truth.
Truth…
The truth is, I led a successful operation.
So?
So, the R&AW chief…
has thousands of crores at his disposal.
I got a reward today.
What was the operation?
That's a secret.
How much did it cost?
That is top secret.
Tell me!
Ravi!
You're home?
Well, yeah.
Sorry.
You wanna gift her the Taj Mahal next?
Drop it, Amma!
Tell me, what do you want?
Files. Did you get them?
I did.
Tell me, what do you want?
Forget about me.
Get some brains for yourself.
Idiot!
When's the delivery?
Tomorrow.
The story makes so much more sense now.
Do you know of Ravi's father?
He was in the army.
Yes, and a middleman for a European arms company after retirement.
As long as he was alive,
he was involved in every single arms deal this country ever made.
She's trained under him.
Sir, should I send a memo to the Afghan desk?
For what?
To change the coordinates of the local assets.
No, no, no.
It'll raise a red flag for his handlers.
-When's the operation? -Sir, next month.
We'll nab him before that.
Your membership.
This operation must end tomorrow.
Fuck!
Where did he get the money from?
That means…
the delivery is complete?
When? How?
We failed, KM.
We failed again.
This can't go on anymore.
We'll all be transferred if this news gets leaked.
It's too much of a risk.
Sack him.
Sir, we need to reach the puppeteer.
-Give me one chance, I'll make sure-- -You're not getting it.
Well, in that case…
I'll leak it myself.
Come on, Jeev.
Are you nuts?
I am.
Sir, it's Ms. Rachael McClane from the US Embassy.
She's here early?
Send her in.
Thank you.
Mishra ji!
Ms. McClane!
I'm so sorry I arrived a little early.
But I really couldn't hold my excitement.
Please, have some laddoos.
Thank you.
-Mr. Wasan, good to see you here. -You too.
Please have some.
What's the occasion?
Should I?
Well, we got the final go-ahead from Washington for the nuclear deal.
It's official.
-That's fantastic! Congratulations! -Yes.
-Congratulations. -Thank you.
Pause.
He enters the compound at 6:15 p.m.
Play.
Forward.
Stop.
Check the time.
6:20 p.m.
He takes one minute to walk from his car to his home every day.
But on Mondays…
Approximately five minutes.
Yeah, I remember last time he had taken some time to reach home.
Not "some."
Precisely four extra minutes.
Where did he spend those extra four minutes?
Rewind.
Stop.
Increase the volume.
Play.
Stop.
What's that sound?
Come.
There's a small door, between the driveway and the door,
which opens into the garage.
That's the sound of this door.
Ravi takes the stairs to go straight to his home every day.
But only on Mondays, he first goes to the garage,
and then he comes home.
What does he do in the garage for these four minutes?
The answer to this mystery is parked in that garage.
Today's a Sunday.
I need a camera in the garage before he gets home tomorrow.
We'll go in when his wife takes the boy to the club.
The pool's closed on Mondays for cleaning.
She'll be home all day.
Then?
We'll have to take a chance.
I need eyes in the garage.
Electric Corporation.
We're here to check the electric meters.
-Where are they? -They're right here.
-Right here? -Yeah, in the garage.
-There's the meter. -Okay.
-Hello? -Hey, Ma! It's Viku! Where are you?
-At work. -You remember it's play night, right?
Of course!
Don't be late today.
Not at all. In fact, I'm gonna get there way before time.
-See you. -See you.
Oh, hell!
Michael!
What's up, Uncle? How are you?
Ma'am, it's bad.
How bad is it?
She's lying in a pool of blood.
Kutty, what's your status?
Just finished.
Help Michael get Portia out. I'm coming.
KM, please don't!
It's an order, Kutty.
Come on!
-Uncle! -Uncle!
-What happened? Is she all right? -She's bleeding!
-Auto! -I think she slipped on the stairs.
-Get in! -She's bleeding!
Come on! Get in!
Easy. Be careful.
The hospital! Go! It's an emergency!
Hey! Which hospital are you taking her to?
Hello?
My life flashed before my eyes on the way to the hospital.
Do you remember how we met?
At the army mess.
New Year's Eve.
No.
That's what I thought as well.
But today, out of the blue, I saw an image.
I was going to the railway station to pick Amma up.
And you had come to Dehradun from Delhi with Brigadier sir on the same day
on the Shatabdi Express.
You were wearing a…
green top.
Blue jeans.
Hey!
Ravi!
Please!
I'm all right!
Okay?
Hey!
You're talking as if you're at my funeral.
Here you go.
Where is he?
She's innocent, sir.
And I'm stupid.
You almost fucked up the operation.
-She could've died. -So?
The piece of meat beating in our chests, it's a brain, not a heart.
And by the way, I know you send money to Dhaka…
-to Octopus's father. -Jeev!
Come on, we're getting late. Let's go.
You do realize what would happen if the chief finds out, right?
Viku, open the door. Please.
Viks! Vi--
I was in the bathroom, Ma.
How was the show?
The usual. Boring.
Baby…
It was an emergency.
It's always been an emergency, Ma.
Okay, I'm very, very, very sorry!
Aren't you tired of apologizing?
And you know what, Ma?
You're a liar
A big, big liar
Vikram!
What are you saying?
Really?
Okay.
Tell me, where do you work?
Capital Secretariat?
Huh?
What the fuck is Capital Secretariat?
Language, Vikram!
Okay…
So, tell me.
Why did you divorce Dad?
That's none of your business.
Cat got your tongue?
Talk to me only when you have the guts to tell me the truth.
Zoom in, Kutty. Zoom in.
God, you're heavy!
Let's go! Let's go!
Black bike. DL-2134.
The foundation for a historic Indo-US nuclear cooperation deal
has been laid today.
Representatives of both governments are present here today at Vigyan Bhawan.
She learned how to tie a sari!
It's true! I did!
It took me some time, but I…
What says you, milady?
-That was very cheeky. -He's coming.
-Sir. -Sir.
What are you two doing here?
Sir, we found the puppeteer.
And both the puppets.
Both?
This time we took some extra precautions.
This time, our team…
only had the information about the weapon that was to be used in this operation.
The perfume bottle.
Only four people knew about the target, the asset, and the date.
You, me, Chief, and…
And?
PM.
Do you realize what you're implying?
Well, sir, if you're getting it, I sure do.
The CIA have definite intel
that R&AW are planning something big in Dhaka.
We are luring Islamabad to give us Osama bin Laden.
If your operation in any manner offends the ISI, which…
I'm sure it will,
then you indirectly jeopardize our mission.
You have a mole in R&AW?
What?
No, sir!
Oh, my God!
It's CIA who has gifted our assets to ISI in Colombo, Cairo, and Istanbul.
Why betray us?
In exchange for what?
Mishra ji, you are completely mistaken.
The heads of Al-Qaeda's Shura.
The drone attacks.
Since Jamat came to power,
Bangladesh has practically been run by ISI.
Do you have any idea how badly it has hurt India?
Again, sir, I have no clue about any of this.
That's Brigadier Mirza,
with Ibrahim Athar, brother of Maulana Masood Azhar.
Planner of IC 814 hijack.
Let's… Let's meet some other day.
I'm heading out to meet the PM.
Washington will not hesitate
in calling off the nuclear deal with India.
I'm so sorry, Mishra ji.
But I am just the messenger.
The nuclear deal was more important to the country than Brigadier Mirza.
Why didn't you tell us?
We could've saved our asset.
Octopus had to die.
To win Mirza's trust,
the CIA wanted us to sacrifice Octopus.
Excuse me, sir.
Shameful.
Okay.
Half the cross is ready.
Let's catch them red-handed tomorrow.
The puppet and his puppeteer.
Michael?
Your turn.
What's the time?
It's five minutes past my time.
Guess what I've made today?
Hint.
It's nice.
Go on. Freshen up.
Surprise dinner.
Your bad time is about to begin, Mr. Ravi.
Leg piece?
You know it's a Tuesday, right?
Stop your charitable facade.
Well, it's gonna be a Wednesday soon, have it.
What's wrong?
Michael!
Turn the light off. Turn it off.
What are you doing?
Get a few clothes, and whatever you can. Just the important stuff.
Hurry up, Charu.
We're leaving in 15 minutes.
-Where are we going? -I don't know.
What did you do?
Did you kill someone?
Hurry up!
You have the rest of your life to ask these questions.
Ravi, what's happening?
-Who did you kill? -No, I didn't…
Where are we going and when are we coming back?
I don't know. Maybe never.
Get some warm clothes for Kunal. Hurry up!
Just keep an eye on the back balcony!
The embassy's sending a car.
Embassy? Which embassy?
What's going on?
Charu…
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Then trust me.
Start packing.
Please.
Listen to me. Ravi! I have the right to know.
Ravi…
are you betraying your country?
I'm helping America fight against the Taliban.
-Why? -Because…
if the Taliban's kicked out of Afghanistan,
which country is gonna benefit the most?
India!
But the overlords in our great agency just won't get that!
They don't get it. And I tried. I really tried!
I really tried to do it the right way!
But I lost, Charu!
So, yes. I think two steps ahead of this country and that's my crime!
But I'm not a traitor! I'm a fucking patriot!
Now I know.
Those diamond earrings, that necklace, where it all came from.
No, you're getting it wrong…
Please, I'm begging of you.
We don't have the time, love.
Just pack your stuff. Please.
I'll-- I'll explain.
I am a soldier's daughter.
I won't betray my country!
Ever!
Charu, please.
Ravi!
The car's here, son.
Please!
Stop the drama!
Let's go!
Please!
I am not leaving!
All right.
Let her die here.
Just get Kunal.
Come on. Hurry up.
You can't take Kunal!
Please don't take him.
-Just-- -Please, don't do this.
Please don't take Kunal.
Come with us.
I love you.
Kunal!
What-- What the hell are you doing?!
Charu!
Charu! She's bleeding. You're bleeding.
Get up. Please!
Kunal!
Kunal!
-Please listen to me! One minute! -Kunal!
Charu, please! We're not leaving!
-Help! -We're not going anywhere.
-We're not leaving, okay? We're not-- -Help!
Amma!
No--
Amma!
Amma, no!
No--
No--
Amma!
Amma!
We got this letter yesterday from the UN.
And?
The same answer
that the US Embassy and the rest of the human rights societies gave us.
"We sympathize with your pain, but we can't help you."
Even the most feral creatures lose their minds when their child…
is taken from them.
In the end, I always mess everything up.
Professionally.
Personally.
Everything.
You expect too much out of yourself.
You scrutinize and judge yourself a lot more than you should.
I've known you since college.
You're just running.
You think the sun won't rise if you wake up late.
Or the moon will disappear if you sleep early.
Krishna, just take a pause.
Breathe.
And understand one thing.
You'll die if you quit this job.
Perhaps that's better, Shashank.
I've got nothing to live for anyway.
Bill.
I'll take care of it.
I'll see you in the parking lot.
I need your help.
Excuse me?
Do I know you?
Maybe, a little more than you should.
I'm sorry, I think you're mistaken.
Sorry.
Please!
Please listen to me.
One minute.
One minute.
Please!
I think I can help you.
He's not just a traitor to me, but to the whole country.
I want my son back.
Please!
Balloons! Get some awesome balloons!
One for five, three for ten, eight for twenty!
Buy some balloons!
Didi, please buy some balloons!
I haven't sold a single balloon all morning.
I'm really hungry! Please, Didi!
Please buy it, Didi!
Please, Didi!
Please.
Didi, balloons!
These could be really useful in America.

Yaara ji!
Help me!
A strange country, stranger people, a different language, a different culture.
It's really tough.
I'm forced to do all the household chores at this age!
All alone!
Look!
I've bruised my fingers doing dishes!
There must be a solution, Yaara ji!
There must be!
Please tell me.
There is, Lalita.
There is.
A solution.
Look.
What?
Maa ji!
Maa ji, please forgive me! Please forgive me!
Yaara ji! Where did she come from?
Maa ji, I knew you could quit breathing,
but you couldn't quit Yaara ji's Satsang!
Maa ji!
Maa ji!
Maa ji!
Yaara ji!
Yaara ji…
she could be a mole planted by the agency.
She's been living in my ashram for months.
I've done the complete background check.
She's clean.
But, Yaara ji…
Look, Lalita.
If you are questioning your faith,
don't accept it!
Yaara ji?
I've done my bit.
Now ask your fucking bosses to release my accounts.
Jai ho!
Come in, sweetheart.
We realize the value of our country when we come to a foreign land.
Cooking, cleaning, I need to do it all by myself.
Let it be, Maa ji.
I'll do it.
It's time for your nap. Please get some rest.
My naptime?
You remember it?
Listen…
may I say something?
Will you trust me?
Sure.
That night…
I accidentally pulled the trigger of the pistol.
I had no intention of killing you.
I know, Maa ji.
I can die peacefully now.
Maa ji…
curse your enemies with death!
My child!
Where are Ravi and Kunal?
Kunal's meeting the counselor today.
They'll be home soon.
Counselor?
Is he all right?
He will be.
Now that you're here.
Right?
Mom!
Where were you?
Mom!
How are you?
Not okay.
Hey, Sid!
-You always forget your bag! -Yeah.
Thank you.
Let's go. We're running late.
Why? Why didn't you call me?
-I did! It didn't connect! -No!
Were you followed?
-No. -Are you sure, Amma?
Hundred percent sure!
I have to inform the CIA.
-No! No! -I cannot--
No way!
You cannot do that until we get our papers legalized.
The CIA, they're the devils!
They'll obviously deport her,
but they'll also move us to some place like Antigua or Cuba!
Look.
Think about it.
We've been blessed with a maid free of cost!
What?
The Iranian has seen everything!
Are you getting me? He's met her as well.
And he'll tell the CIA if I don't.
He's brought a whole bloody town from Iran.
I'm sure he gets it.
I cannot take a chance.
I cannot!
Ravi, do me a favor,
and do yourself a favor as well!
Look.
-I can't cook and clean anymore. -What the--
We'll get a maid, Amma!
You'll get a maid?
Says the guy who doesn't have two pennies to rub together!
You have no job! You have no money!
And this heartless winter.
Your CIA really is great!
My CIA?
My CIA?!
Whose idea was it to spy for them? Whose?!
You're the reason we've become fugitives!
Really?
It's my fault?
Aren't you forgetting something?
-The parties! -Stop.
-The Armani suits! -Stop it.
The cars!
Single malt!
Stop bringing up my single malts in every discussion!
Grandma's at it again.
You know what?
Just get a needle and thread and sew my mouth shut!
You're not getting it.
Please.
Don't-- Don't do this.
Please.
Yaara ji told me she's clean.
Well, what if--
What if the agency has recruited Yaara ji?
What are you gonna do then?
Curse your damn tongue!
-How dare you question Yaara ji! -No.
I am not questioning Yaara ji.
But this is very strange, Amma.
Just think about it.
From halfway around the world, all alone, by herself,
From halfway around the world, all alone, by herself, she set out to look for us?
And she found us?
Found us!
In South Dakota?
How can you even believe that?
Because I'm a mother.
I understand the pain of being a mother.
A mother will do anything for her child!
Exactly!
That's what I'm saying!
Do you understand?
Mommy, you know, we've all changed our names.
I'm Siddharth Singh.
Papa's Robin Singh.
And Grandma's Sarita.
We'll have to change your name as well, right?
What should we name you?
Karishma?
Kareena?
Madhuri!
Madhuri Singh!
-It's great, right? -Siddharth!
Siddharth, son.
Go to your grandma.
I wanna stay here with Mommy.
-I'm always gonna be here now. -She's not going anywhere, all right?
Sarita! Where are you, Sarita?!
I'm so happy you came back, Charu.
I just hadn't imagined…
I couldn't even dare to imagine that you'd come back.
You're back, and I'm…
I'm really happy.
We're on thin ice with the CIA.
And they're very upset with us.
And?
They want to interview you.
It's just a procedure. And…
It's all right. They have to do their job. And…
The mission's success depends on how well you can hide the truth.
You'll always have to be one step ahead.
It's impossible to legally extradite them now
because their names, their identities, have completely changed.
That's why it's going to be a long-drawn operation.
There's only one way to bring the traitor back.
Catch the puppet and his puppeteer red-handed on the stage.
When did you arrive in the United States?
9th November.
And how did you book your hotels in all the cities?
Travel agent.
Name of the travel agency?
Travel Essence.
What was the name of the first hotel that you stayed in?
Holiday Inn, L.A.
You'll be caught if you act so confident.
They'll know you've been trained to beat the machine.
Hotel?
You heard right.
I-- I don't remember.
I think it was Park Inn.
No, Holiday Inn.
She seems clean.
But we're gonna have to verify every detail of her story.
Until we do, she remains a serious risk to you,
as well as to us.
I just want my family back, Doctor.
Of course, you do.
Yeah.
But this is going to significantly delay your citizenship processing.
Why?
Look.
As of now, you don't exist in the United States,
and we can't jeopardize our position
until we're certain that what she's telling us is the truth.
Okay. I'll wait. How-- How long will this take?
Until her tourist visa expires and,
like you, she becomes a refugee in the United States.
In the meantime,
we need to be careful.
If Yaara ji says she's clean, she is…
clean!
We need to be on our toes.
We can't take a chance.
And we need to inform the CIA, even if we have a hint of suspicion.
-What's this? -Surveillance cameras.
Send her grocery shopping tomorrow.
All right?
We'll set these up in the house when she's out.
Now, let's tune in to some Bollywood music from the '70s.
Hi, my name is Robin. How can I help you?
We'll have some popcorn, please.
Right. Anything to go with the popcorn?
Maybe a water.
Maybe a water. And for you?
-That's all. Thank you. -Thank you very much.
Okay.
Thank you.
There you go.
I'll just be a second.
Hello? Doctor!
Yeah, really?
Yes, that's-- that's… That's great news.
Yeah. Thank you.
Right! We're having popcorn!
Your daughter-in-law's been let off the hook.
Really?
All thanks to Yaara ji's blessings.
Langley says get rid of the cameras,
stop the surveillance and live.
Thank God! Yaara ji!
Here, have some sweets.
Sugar?
Sugar-free.
Hello?
Where are you?
-We'll contact you soon. -No.
I want to know right now.
Where are you right now?
At home.
Listen, you're taking a huge risk.
It's just not safe to talk on the phone.
-If he wakes up-- -He won't.
I mixed the medicine in his drink.
But you're not supposed to use it--
How long do I have to wait?!
Do you realize what I'm going through?
I'm dying every day out here!
Look, we had warned you, right?
"You are going down a dark, filthy well."
"You might never see light again."
But…
we can abort this mission any time
and take you back safely.
And Kunal?
I can't live without him.
I understand your pain.
No, you can't!
You need to be a mother to understand my pain!
I have a nineteen-year-old son.
And he hates me.
Everyone has their own pain and their own scars.
You're married?
I was.
What do you mean?
We got divorced.
Remarried?
-No. -Why?
Lost her.
Her?
How?
Your husband killed her.
You have been double-crossed, my dear.
She's working for the ISI.
Pack your bags and come back to India.
And… don't leave a trace behind.
The Indian Embassy. Namaskar. How may I help you?
Could you please connect me to Krishna Mehra?
Ms. Mehra has been transferred.
When?
Where?
I'm sorry, we're not allowed to share the details.
Anything else I can help you with?
No, thanks.
Thank you. Have a nice day.
You're a blot on my career.
I never betrayed you, Krishna.
I joined the ISI…
just to help you.
For you.
Of course.
Without informing me?
You have 24 hours. Go back to Dhaka,
or you'll never be able to go back.
Passport and ticket.
Your stuff's already in the car.
My officers will make sure you board the aircraft.
Don't ever try to come to India again.
Jamat’s coming to power this time,
if Mirza lives.
I can neutralize Mirza.
She put her life at stake to prove her loyalty to me.
Codename Octopus.
The perfume bottle.
It contains an aerosol variant of the VX nerve agent.
It's extremely lethal.
Operation is set for tonight.
Please keep me updated, Mirza Sahib.
I'm extremely concerned for your safety.
I'm sorry.
Does your son know?
No.
His father didn't tell him either?
He's a nice man.
He wants me to come out when I'm ready
and share my truth with him.
Greetings!
I have seen nothing.
I swear! Nothing!
-You're talking to your family in India? -Yes.
-Talk. Talk. -No, I'm done.
What are you doing so late in the night?
Spying!
You know the old Black man living in the house across the street?
I don't feel good about him.
I see his car around wherever I go.
Just now, I saw someone up there in the window watching your house.
-Really? -Yeah.
Did you tell Robin about this?
No, no, no.
But I think I will.
First thing, tomorrow morning.
Enjoy your smoke.
-Good night. -Good night.
Fida!
You?
Fida!
Let him die.
Let him die.
If he survives, you won't.
-Go home. -But--
Go home! Everything will be all right. Just go!
Just go!
CACTUS: TO YOU AS WELL
Did she reply?
The message has still not delivered.
Really?
Yeah, since the day before.
Mommy, when are we gonna get some ice cream?
That's where we're going, Kunu.
-Come on. -Let's go!
I'm not here to stop you.
I just wanna ask where you plan on going?
Embassy.
They'll have to take us back.
You could've just told me if that's what you wanted.
I don't trust you anymore.
Really?
Yeah.
A human being…
is just a bag of meat and bones for people like you.
An asset as long as they're useful,
a liability when they're not.
How do you people look at yourselves in the mirror?
Why do you indulge in this bloodshed?
Your father was an army man, wasn't he?
Did you ever ask him the same question?
As long as the world is divided between countries and religions,
this bloodshed will continue.
And we're all responsible for it.
You too.
Me too.
It was always your choice.
And it still is.
I… I spoke with Langley.
You will need to wait another six months.
No, no, I-- We've done everything you've asked us to do.
Okay?
And her visa's expired.
And she'll apply for refugee status only when we get our papers.
And you'll get them.
Soon.
Trust me.
Do I have a choice?
Robin…
we always have a choice.
By the way, an old friend of yours is coming to visit.
He's looking forward to meeting you.
Friend? I-- What do you mean?
Mirza.
Brigadier Mirza.
He's in the U.S., visiting his daughter.
Insisted on thanking you in person for saving his life.
So, Mirza, my wife and I will see you at your place Saturday night for dinner.
Oh, and Robin…
Tell Maa ji to make that fabulous mutton rogan josh of hers.
My wife will absolutely love it.
Lord Mirza's returning to his castle.
He's meeting Brutus for dinner.
He could sleep peacefully if he's well-fed.
I can make a deal with Brutus.
No, no, no! You're not doing any such thing.
Mission to bring Brutus back is in place.
Okay?
You just give me the details.
I will be speaking to Langley.
They will have to deport him.
How can you forget what Mirza's done to us?
Me forgetting it doesn't matter.
It's important that you forget it.
Do you understand that?
KM…
KM, this is an order!
You're doing nothing there! I'll--
And this is our India.
And that's America.
They look so close on this map, right?
But the planes sure do take a long time to get there!
Get me the phone, sweetie.
Hello?
Hello, Paaji.
Who?
Cactus.
This gora has messed it up.
Mirza Sahib now wants rogan josh and the meat must be halal as well.
Luckily, I found Peter.
The herdsman by the church.
He serves halal meat to the Pakistanis,
I thought he could surely do it for an Indian as well.
He agreed.
Do you wanna come check it out?
What's wrong?
Come-- Let's check--
Charu, give me an apple for Kunal.
Maa ji, namaste.
Officially or unofficially,
Langley will deport you if they get this video.
Jeev's waiting for my phone call in Delhi.
No, this is bullshit.
This won't--
What?
What do you want?
We've heard the fictional heroic fantasies you tell Kunal.
The boy thinks you're a hero.
You could be one.
For your son and for your country.
We'll take you back to the country. Honorably.
Michelle!
-Yeah? -Michelle, you ready?
-Yeah. -We gotta go.
-Sweetie, we won't be long, okay? -I'll be fine. Have fun.
Hey, Rose, study.
-Yeah, yeah. -No television!
You be good.
-Just go. -See you, honey.
Have fun!
Mirza Sahib!
-Welcome. -My savior!
Thank you.
Hello.
Robin!
-So great to see you! -Good to see you.
Come, come.
-I love the smell of Indian food. -Thanks for having us.
Come in.
So wonderful!
Oh, my God!
-Mirza Sahib! -Cheers!
-Yeah, honey, everything all right? -Dad! The power's not here.
And I have my exams tomorrow. What do I do?
-What? -Can you guys please come home now?
I'm really scared. I don't know what's happening.
-Yeah, that is odd. -All the other neighbors
have their lights on, but we don't.
No, no-- No, no, don't worry. I--
I'll come back. I'll be right there. Okay.
All right. Bye-bye.
All okay, Doc?
Yeah. Just… I've gotta head back home.
There seems to be some problem with the electricity at the house.
Darling, you stay here. Enjoy dinner.
-I'll be back as soon as I can. -Are you sure?
Yeah, yeah.
Doc, maybe I can come with you?
-No, no, it's just a fuse or something. -I'll help.
You sure he can manage without you?
You know what?
He's got this. I've trained him well.
-Cheers to that. -Cheers to that!
So, tell me more about yourself.
All good, ma'am?
The child's sleeping in there.
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
You're absolutely right, Maa ji.
My daughter, she's been pestering me.
-English, if you don't mind, Mirza Sahib. -So, sorry.
Sorry.
My daughter, she is after my life!
But I said--
Doc says he's going to be late.
But he says we can start eating without him. It's fine.
But I'd rather wait for him.
Why, Mirza Sahib?
The lamb will come back to life if you keep it waiting.
Have it before it does!
-Maa ji! -I'll fix you a drink.
Your sense of humor. Impeccable!
Actually, I am famished!
-If it's not rude then, can I start? -Of course.
Then let's do one thing. Let's all of us have dinner together.
Thank you.
But you must not eat before David comes.
Why?
It's Karva Chauth today.
What's that?
In our culture, on this day, we fast for the whole day.
And if you eat before your husband does, then it brings him bad luck!
Really?
Yes, Michelle.
I think you should not take a chance.
But you can drink as much as you want.
All right!
Mashallah!
Damn it, David! What is taking you so long?!
Absolutely!
Wow! Look at this gravy!
Here you go.
Thank you, Maa ji.
I'll fix myself another drink, if you don't mind.
To go with the food--
-I'll do it. -Charu will do it.
Please, enjoy your food.
Maa ji, let me make a plate for you as well.
No, no, no, Mirza Sahib.
I've taken a vow, you see.
I won't touch meat until we get citizenship.
One ice cube, please.
Ravi!
Oh, no. Please don't mind me! Cholesterol. Doctor's orders.
You're too young for cholesterol, my friend.
Yeah, well…
And you?
Karva Chauth!
Exactly!
So, the lamb's been slaughtered especially for me.
Of course. What are you waiting for? Please begin.
If you don't mind,
may I eat with my hands?
Come on, Mirza Sahib!
That's the right way to do it!
I'll just wash my hands then.
-Sure, it's that way. I'll-- -I'll manage. Don't worry.
What happened?
He wants to eat with his fingers.
It's a cultural thing.
Okay.
You could've at least put some mutton on your plate.
He's on to us.
No, he's not!
And why were you pestering him to eat his food?
Careful. The gori's still here.
"Gori"?
I know that word. It's slang for a white woman.
No, no, no. You're mistaken.
Where are you going?
Misunderstanding.
Okay, don't panic.
-Everything will be all right. Just wait. -Yeah, I'll tell him.
Is there something fishy going on here?
Fishy? No, no!
Why would you say that, Michelle?
Why would you say that?
-Eat. You eat. -Have wine.
I can't eat!
-Just eat. -Ravi!
Mirza Sahib!
Mirza-- Mirza Sahib! What are you doing?
-Mirza Sahib, no, no. -Michelle,
-call David right now. -What happened?
Nothing happened! Just call him, I said!
My phone's in the car.
-My phone is here. Just take it. -Okay.
-Mirza Sahib, you're mistaken! -Shut up, I said!
-I'm trying to save you-- -I'll slit her bloody throat!
-I'll do it! -Please. Let's talk.
Let's talk about it.
Amma!
Amma!
No, Ravi!
-Get out of my way. -You’re not going to do it.
-Move… -No, Ravi!
-Her blood is still on my hands. -No, Ravi.
There's blood on my hands!
He killed my mother.
But your son is alive.
He needs you.
We need you.
Amma!
What is going on with the electricity in this town?
Robin, I'm back!
Robin?
Robin, where are you guys?
What the fuck?!
David!
Let me be perfectly clear.
If Mirza lives,
I'll help you out of this…
delicate situation.
But if he dies,
there's nothing I can do.
You'll all spend the rest of your days in a cage in Guantánamo Bay.
And the United States will be exposed for espionage in a country
that they call an ally.
After what he's done?
Ravi would never admit to spying for the United States.
And I sure as hell won't either.
You just did.
Say cheese.
If we're exposed,
I promise you, I will personally ensure that you're held responsible
for the murder of the Bangladeshi Defense Minister.
That's not what I want.
And nor do you.
David, he's still alive.
Shut up!
Look.
What exactly is it that you want?
Seems like you guys are smart only in your movies.
Why do you think he's still alive?
I could've slit his throat.
If we put his head down…
he'll bleed out faster.
Not that.
Why don't you try the dal?
Yes.
Thank you.
You can relax now.
Bangladesh is in shock today
as they deal with the tragic death of their defense minister,
Brigadier Saqlain Mirza.
Mirza, who was on a personal visit to the U.S.,
slipped while taking a shower in his hotel
leading to a fatal blow to his head.
His body will be returned to Bangladesh
following an official State Department inquiry.
Welcome back.
What?
I just remembered Vikram.
He wanted to be a pilot when he was a kid.
It's his birthday today.
So, did you wish him?
Why?
He said, "Talk to me only when you have the guts to tell me the truth."
I didn't have the courage back then,
and I still don't.
You didn't need this courage when you told me.
You were a stranger to me.
Maybe that's the reason you're a stranger to him today.
The truth cuts deep, but it doesn't take long to heal.
Call him.
And give him his birthday gift.
-Happy birthday, dear Vikram! -Happy birthday, dear Vikram!
-Happy birthday to you! -Happy birthday to you!
Come on! Take some.
Come on.
Hello?
-[man] Hey, buddy! -Come on.
[woman] Somebody stop him! He's got my purse! Police! Freeze!
Hey! Stop! Out of my way!
Get out of my way! Out of my way! Police! Move!
You did not just go down there…
What the fuck?
Fuck sakes.
Get your fucking hands in the air! [echoing]
I ain't gonna say it again, motherfucker!
Fuck.
[distorted] Hello, Detective Bozwick.
-I want to play a game. -No!
The 3 train is arriving in two minutes.
It is up to you to decide if this will be your final stop.
You have taken the witness stand many times,
and railroaded innocent people with your lies, putting them away in jail.
Today, it is you who will be railroaded.
You have one chance to live.
Tear from your mouth the tongue that has so often been used to lie and to deceive.
Take a leap of faith, and you will live.
Only your weight will rip away your lying tongue and save you.
Live or die, make your choice.
[man] What you talking about? That movie won awards.
[Zeke] You know, Tom Hanks is a straight pimp, man, but I don't know if you could make that movie today.
[man] What the fuck you going on about?
-Special needs abuse. -[man] Special needs?
-What, you woke now? -[Zeke] Not woke,
but you can't say "handicapped," you can't say "retarded." You got to say "special needs," I'm trying to be respectful.
Forrest Gump was special needs, man. What was the name of the girl?
-Jenny. -[Zeke] Jenny.
He did everything for Jenny. This motherfucker did some shit.
He jogged across the whole country.
He beat China in ping-pong. You know how fucking hard that shit is?
He was a war hero.
Who the fuck is nicer than Forrest Gump?
His best friend was a nigga and a white boy with no legs.
He made a billion dollars selling shrimp. And she still wouldn't fuck him.
Hey, eventually, they got together. Yeah, after she got AIDS.
As soon as she got AIDS, she's like, "Hey, Forrest…"
-[elevator bell dings] -Get the fuck out of here, man.
Giving that guy AIDS? -Are you kidding me? -Yeah.
-That shit's abusive. -But he ain't get it.
I ain't see no sequel. Where's Gump 2?
Yo, Rico just got off the elevator. -Oh, shit. -[guns cocking]
Let's do this.
Get down! Get down right now! Get down right now! You know what this is!
You know what this is! That's right! Put it all! Come on! Down!
Fill up this bag! Put it in the motherfucking bag! [man 1] Come on.
-You know what to do! -Chill!
Get back!
[man 2] I want that coke! I want that money! [loudly] I want everything!
Shit.
[man 3] Ninety seconds, we gotta go!
[officer] Freeze! Police! Hands up! Get your hands up!
[officer 2] Get out of the car. Get the fuck out of…
Zeke? Is that you?
Zeke?
[Garza] What the fuck is wrong with you? You do an undercover op…
You don't clear it, there's no coordination.
We are Homicide, but you're robbing drug dealers in a fucking hotel.
I had a dozen 911 calls come in. What if someone got killed?
What if someone got killed? That crew killed four people last week, and we got them.
And we could have got more of them if my cover wasn't blown.
Fuck your cover, Zeke!
You were off on your own, as usual, no backup, nothing.
No backup, 'cause there's nobody on the force I can fucking trust!
From now on, you're going to learn to be a team player. You're getting a partner. Jeannie, send Schenk in.
You're getting a partner. Jeannie, send Schenk in. Do I look like a fucking Jamaican nanny?
Do I smell like jerk sauce and baby wipes? No!
[in Jamaican accent] Me no want no partner! [in normal tone] I'm not babysitting some fucking rook.
Yes, you are.
Just because your dad was Chief fucking Marcus Banks doesn't mean you get out of the shit.
Stop making this about my father, okay? He's gone, you're the head of the department now. [softly] Yeah. Drama queen.
Zeke, it's been 12 years. Yes! Twelve fucking years.
Twelve years ago, I turned in a dirty cop, I get a medal for it. Big fucking deal!
I also got a bullet, and I got to look over my back for the rest of my career.
Shut up!
It is too fucking hot in here for me to listen to this bullshit.
I got a heat wave going on.
We got rolling blackouts, -the city is nuts. Stop! -[knock on door]
You wanted to see me, Captain? -Yeah, come in. -[door closes]
Zeke, I want you to meet Detective in training, William Schenk.
He was the top of his academy, so don't screw this up.
Zeke is going to break you in, show you the ropes.
Detective Banks, it's good to…
-Yup… -[door opens, closes]
-Go. -Okay.
[officer 1 on intercom] Officer Harris, 1-0-3. Officer Harris, 1-0-3.
[officer 2 on intercom] Sergeant Jones, front desk. Sergeant Jones, front desk.
So, uh… How do you take your coffee in the morning?
Alone.
Okay.
Hey, man, I get it. I wouldn't want to be stuck with some random kid either.
You don't want to be my partner.
You don't know that. Your dad's the reason for all of this.
He's why I wanted to do this in the first place. And I'm not him.
Prepare to be underwhelmed.
-[door opens] -[Garza] Banks and Schenk…
Some homeless guy got hit by the 3 train. You're up.
[officer 3 on intercom] Detective Peterson, pick up 2-2-1. Detective Peterson, 2-2-1.
[Schenk] This is you?
Beats the squad car.
Detective Banks en route to that 10-19. Would that be north or south side of the street?
-[dispatch on radio] Northbound. -[Zeke] Copy that.
What are you doing?
Oh, it's just family.
This is my wife, Emma, this is my son, Charlie.
They're cute. Enjoy it while it lasts. "While it lasts"?
Nothing happier than the wife of a new detective,
and nothing more angry than that same bitch 10 years later.
Maybe it's 'cause you call them bitches.
I'm half-Italian, trust me. Women do not like it when you call them bitches…
What are you telling me about women, -young motherfucker? Shit. -[grunts]
I just said it to you, I didn't say it to a woman.
I don't say it to their face. It's not like I'm Too Short.
We just met, but, you know, you're firing already, and I appreciate it.
I mean, all I'm saying is, you know, most crime happens on weekends, holidays,
so you would think anybody married to a cop would understand this.
But no.
One day, your wife will be angry 'cause you couldn't go to her sister's birthday dinner.
You can give a woman 600 Tuesdays. It ain't worth three Saturday nights.
So, uh… I'm guessing you're divorced.
Divorced, no, not yet. I'm going through a divorce.
That's even worse. It's kind of like chemo.
Shit. Sorry.
Sorry for what? We're cops. This is the life we choose.
Highest divorce rate, highest suicide rate.
Highest rate of domestic violence.
Yo, when you decided to become a cop, you pretty much assured yourself
you were gonna die alone.
[Schenk] My wife and I, we're doing this counseling. She's got me, uh, working on, like, communication.
[Zeke] Counseling? Yeah, that's nice.
Yeah, my wife fucked the counselor.
Fuck, really?
-[Zeke] Yeah. -Jesus.
[Zeke] Women cheat, too.
It hurts. God damn it, it hurts.
Women cheat, too, but here's what happens.
-Women cheat in the daytime. -[Schenk chuckles]
You can get away with a lot of shit in the daytime.
That's right. You can ride -a lot of dick before dusk. -Mm-hmm.
Shit, man, I just found out Pilates doesn't even exist.
Wait, seriously?
Emma loves Pilates. I'm sure she does. I'm sure she does.
But don't worry about it.
You're gonna be fine. You gonna be married forever.
What do we got? See for yourself.
Watch yourself.
If you're gonna throw up, don't do it on the evidence.
Are you kidding me? I've been dreaming about this since I was 12 years old.
You see a lot of TV sets on the subway?
[Zeke] You get everything down here.
Damn. Wow.
[Schenk] This bum's gonna be tough to ID.
I'm not too sure this is a bum.
I don't know a lot of bums trying to get their steps in.
Whoever this is, is married…
and wears a Fitbit.
This package just came in.
-For me? -[officer] Yeah.
[Schenk] What is that?
"Play me."
-Okay. -[Schenk] Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
Don't want to fuck up my computer.
[distorted voice on video] Hello, Detective Banks.
I'm here to help reform the Metro Police,
to remind them of their oath to the people of this city.
One officer from your station refused to be reformed.
He will not be the last to play my game.
If that spiral is what I think it is… Jigsaw?
Wait, I thought the Jigsaw killer was dead? Yeah, but if it's another copycat…
It's gonna be a shit show.
I recognize that building.
It's the courthouse.
Let's check it out.
[Schenk] What are you guys doing here? Well, we thought you boys might need some backup.
Fuck you, Fitch, it's not your case.
Yo, Zeke.
What do we got here?
What the fuck is that?
Is that a fucking tongue?
[groans] Fucking shit.
4-5-3… Who's 4-5-3?
[Garza] Circle up!
Okay, here's what we know.
Dental records confirm it's Boz.
Sorry, guys.
But, look, we got to catch the son of a bitch that did this.
Train conductor says he didn't see much.
Says he saw Boz hanging in the air right before he hit the windshield.
Says he thinks he saw Boz bleeding from the mouth badly.
The package was sent from a delivery service that picked it up on a stoop on Anglin Drive.
What about the spirals?
Hey, Cap, obviously it's a Jigsaw copycat, so that's where we got to concentrate our focus.
Sure, Fitch, but I want you to stick with hard evidence.
Kraus, contact the Feds, get anything they got.
Files, old videos, anything. Do we have street images?
We're working on it, but Digital Forensics was able to map Boz's movement off the Fitbit.
Last place it was registered was Stuart's Point, time-stamped during the fireworks.
Someone needs to call Kara, his wife, let her. know. Yeah, I already called her.
You called Kara? Yeah.
-Do you know Kara? -No.
Did you actually talk to her, or did you text her?
Let me guess, you sent an emoji. Do they have a dead husband emoji?
I talked to her, asshole.
Hey. We had to notify her before it leaked to the press.
Okay, O'Brien's got point… O'Brien?
This is mine.
Me and the rook were first on scene.
Banks…
I'm sorry, isn't this protocol? Now you're part of the team again, Zeke?
Fuck you.
No, fuck you. [softly] Come on, Zeke.
When all you motherfuckers were treating me like shit,
shooting me in my fucking back,
Boz was my friend!
Boz played with my kid. We went to fucking games.
Fuck me? No, fuck you.
Fucking assholes…
[Garza] Zeke! Zeke, fucking stop!
-[sighs] In here! Now! -[door opens]
Zip up! Get out. [officer] Okay, Captain.
-Damn, nigga, wash your hands. -[door closes]
I get why you want this.
Boz was my friend, too, but you can't do this alone.
I need the whole department on this, working together.
I'm not trying to do this alone, okay?
Boz is my family, man. You gotta let me take lead.
You gotta let me catch this motherfucker.
All right, guys, we got a change of plans.
Banks is taking lead.
[Zeke] Listen up. I know some of you guys think I'm a rat.
Some of you think I'm a snitch.
Some of you are mad I fucked your mother.
Boz was last seen at the July 4th parade at Stuart's Point…
…so there should be plenty of surveillance footage,
so check your hashtags, Instagram…
Hey!
Now, we got a dead cop here, guys, who was brutally killed.
A fallen brother whose tongue was ripped out.
We need to focus on the case and solve this.
So get the footage to Detective Banks and put your personal shit aside.
O'Brien, you good?
No problem here, Captain. [Garza] Good.
Let's go.
Yo, where we going? Pay our respects. Put on a suit.
[tearfully] Zeke… -Kara… -[Kara shudders]
It's okay.
Whoever did this, I'm gonna find them. I don't understand… How did it happen?
[woman] Kara, your mother's on the phone. [Kara] Yeah, okay.
Zeke. Lisa.
You okay? I, uh… I texted you.
Yeah, I got it.
Is Brian here? No, my sister's watching him.
Your sister… So, Rhonda gets to see my son, but I don't?
Are we really gonna do this here?
No. Not today.
-Hey, I'm William. -[Zeke] Stop. Zeke's partner, yup…
I'll wait outside. I'll wait outside.
[Kara] Jamie's at the neighbor's.
I don't know how I'm supposed to tell him what happened to his dad.
[Zeke] I can't imagine what you're going through right now.
I know this is a bad time,
but I got to ask you a couple of questions.
In the last few weeks, did you notice anything unusual?
I mean, did Boz say anything, or act stressed out?
He was a cop, Zeke.
So nothing out of the ordinary? [Kara] No.
There was one thing, there was a black SUV parked outside one night last week.
You get a make?
-Range Rover, Escalade, Lincoln? -I don't know.
I told Boz about it and he went out, and he walked up, and, I don't know,
and he walked up, and, I don't know, the next thing I know, he was yelling at somebody inside.
Any idea what they were yelling about? Did you hear anything?
No. If I see it again, I'll get a license plate.
If you don't mind, could you get me his devices?
I need to look at his iPad, laptop.
-Yeah. -Thanks, Kara.
Nice… I gotta go, guys. All right, be safe.
Zeke.
He knew you were a good cop.
You find out who did this.
You pull a gun on your old man?
You out of your fucking mind? I could have killed you.
What are you talking about? I got the gun.
I could have killed you.
How'd you get in here? Did you forget who the landlord is?
Yeah, but that doesn't give you the right to just walk in here anytime you want.
Renters got rights. You start paying some rent, you can get some rights.
Heard about Boz. You all right?
No, Dad, I'm… I'm fucked up.
Sorry to hear that. I know how close you were.
Jigsaw copycat. [sucks teeth] That could be difficult.
-What are you saying? -Nothing.
Just, you know, being lead detective, a lot of responsibility.
You got a problem with that? Or are you just scared I'm gonna embarrass you?
See? That right there.
This ain't about you.
You always making shit about you.
That's the shit that ruined your career and your marriage.
So, now you're giving fatherly advice? What you talkin' 'bout, Willis?
Dad. We live in the same building.
I saw you out front the other day,
you nodded at me like we were the only two black guys in the mall.
We haven't had a meal together in over a year.
Haven't had a meal?
What? Are you hungry, nigga? You want to go get a fucking slice?
Let me tell you something. My father went to work, came home. That was it.
My father went to work, came home. That was it.
All right, I'm gonna get out of here, son.
I'm gonna go to Kara's, pay my respects. You're gonna be all right.
Come over tonight, I'll order some food, we'll go over the case.
Just because your dad was Chief fucking Marcus Banks… Stop making this about my father. Twelve years ago,
Stop making this about my father. Twelve years ago, I turned in a dirty cop.
-[gunshot] -[Zeke] Pete! Pete! What happened? What happened?
He pulled a gun on me.
The witness pulled a gun on you?
Because there's nobody on the force I can fucking trust! [echoing]
I've been staring at this shit for five hours.
I don't even look at porn that long.
Okay, I'm out. What's next?
Well, why don't you check with Digital Forensics
and see if anybody in Boz's phone log has a black SUV?
[Schenk] My phone is dead, you got a charger? Your phone's dead, what are you, a little girl?
Let me borrow your phone, shut up. Okay.
[Schenk] Thank you.
Don't drain my battery watching Twilight.
Glad to see you joined us.
You think this is linked to John Kramer?
I sent some pictures to the Feds, we'll see what happens.
[Garza] How are we doing on surveillance?
Please tell me the $20 million the city spent on cameras got us something?
Drury?
Yeah… [sighs] Street cameras from here to here have already been scrubbed through.
Facial recognition came up with nothing.
There were two cameras broken on this corner.
Fitch and Kraus are there now to canvas it.
No. Closed. Closed.
[Fitch] There's Boz.
[Kraus] Who's that he's chasing?
[Fitch] I know that guy.
Benny Wrights. He's a hustler.
Serious tweaker.
Flops in a burnt-out bread factory down on 12th.
Deals with a pusher, street name Speez.
-Should we tell Zeke? -Fuck him.
I'll take the building, you track down Speez.
Hey, boss, let me see that gun over there. The one on the left. Yeah, yeah, come on, come on.
On behalf of the Metro Police, I want to thank you for your generosity.
I got shit to do. I'm out.
What's his deal? He's a crooked piece of shit.
-Let's just call it a night. -[Schenk] You sure?
Yeah. Go home. Go see your wife, go see your kid.
What's your boy's name?
-Charlie. -Charlie. All right, I'll put him down and come right back.
No, no, no, I'm not going to be here.
Meeting my dad for dinner, gonna go over the case.
Okay.
Hey, William. Yeah?
Good work today.
Thanks, man.
-See you tomorrow. -[Zeke] Yeah.
-[door closes] -[Fitch] Benny?
Wake up, Benny.
Rise and shine, my man.
Benny, come on. Get up.
Come on, Benny, get up. -[kicks lightly] -[hollow thud]
You all right?
[gasps] Fuck me.
[on voice mail] This is Deborah Kraus, leave me a message. Kraus, call me.
[on voice mail] Lieutenant Tim O'Brien here, leave a message and I'll get back to you.
[yells] Help! Help me!
[speaking in distorted voice] Hello, Detective Fitch. I want to play a game.
-[Schenk] Hey, Zeke. -William.
What are you doing up? I told you to take the rest of the night off.
Uh, it's fine, Charlie's sleeping.
-[baby crying] -Was sleeping. Just waiting for Emma to get home, she's having a girl's night.
Girl's night out. Okay.
You better be careful with that, might be a dick night out.
[chuckles] Just because you're getting a divorce, it doesn't mean that everyone else's marriages have to end, too.
Sounds like you got your hands full. You want to call me back?
Nah, it's okay, we're sleep-training. It's a fucking nightmare.
we're sleep-training. It's a fucking nightmare. Look, man, um… I know you and Boz were close,
I don't know how to tell you this. You got something to say, William, say it.
Well, I'm looking through all the Metro records like you asked,
and Boz was accused of lying on the stand more than anybody…
by like a wide fucking margin. [Zeke] Jesus.
The courthouse…
That's why the tongue was at the courthouse.
[Zeke] Can I help you?
Are you Marcus Banks?
-No, I'm his son. -Well, Terroni delivery.
Oh, okay.
Dad!
Pop, got your food.
Motherfucker!
How the fuck could you not call me first? I tried, but you didn't answer.
Well, why didn't you wait for me to fucking call you back?
'Cause you would have talked me out of it. I told the truth.
Get the fuck out of my face, Zeke. Can we get the room?
God damn it.
I knew I should have never let him become a cop.
This shit's gonna go sideways fast.
He turned in a dirty cop. Pete was a scumbag.
Press will make him out to be a hero. And what about the other cops?
You think they're gonna call him a hero, too?
He did the right thing.
You know how much internal damage control I have to do?
We'll handle it.
-We always do, huh? -[knocks on door]
[man] Chief Banks, WF Action News here.
-[knocks on door] -Are you in?
Oh, I'm sorry, but I think your face was trespassing on my property.
Is there something I can help you with? No.
All right. Fuck you very much.
[courier guy] For Detective Zeke Banks.
[officer] Banks, incoming. On my desk. Right now.
A courier brought it. We're holding him for questioning.
[speaking in distorted voice] Hello, Detective Banks.
Salvation was offered, but it was declined.
This fucker thinks he's Jigsaw. Even got a doll this time.
I have a bone to pick with the police department,
and if you're going to point fingers… [Garza] 12th Street Bridge. I know that place.
…you should start by pointing them at yourselves.
Geez, that's two blocks away.
Until you come clean, many more will die.
[officer 1] Stay back.
[officer 2] Stay sharp.
[officer 3] Whoa, hold it there, guys.
[officer] What a sick fuck, man.
[Zeke speaking softly] What the fuck?
Oh, no…
[officer] God almighty.
9-8-2.
-[faint murmuring] -It's Fitch.
This is Detective Banks requesting backup. [echoing]
I'm on Decker Street. Request backup!
-Fuck him. -[Zeke] In pursuit, requesting backup! [echoing]
-Ah, fuck! -Fuck me.
[paramedic] You're going to be okay, stay with me. You're good, you're gonna be okay. You're gonna be just fine.
-Zeke! -Sir! Please, please! Let us do our job, come on.
Come on, let us do our jobs, let's go. Let's go.
Where the fuck were all of you, huh?
My son called for backup three times in eight minutes
and none of you motherfuckers could get here?
Nobody? Nothing?
Crickets. All right, this is what I'm going to do.
I'm going to call Dispatch and find out who was closest available,
and when I do, I'm going to take this gun and shoot that motherfucker.
-We clear? -[Fitch clears throat]
-Fitch, it was you? -[groans]
You fucking with my son again? -[groaning] -God damn you, son of a bitch!
Get off me! You're done, motherfucker, you hear me?
You're fucking done! Don't let me see your face again. [echoing]
[Zeke] All right, call Kraus, find out Fitch's last location.
[speaking in distorted voice] Hello, Detective Fitch. I want to play a game.
The tide of justice is rising around you.
In 90 seconds, the water will rise to the height of the copper wires,
and if you are still in the tank, you will be electrocuted.
Unless you make the sacrifice that will cleanse you.
[Fitch] God… Oh, God…
You murdered a man because he insulted you.
[Fitch on video] Put your hands where I can see them, motherfucker.
I said put your hands where I can see them, sir.
Your finger pulled the trigger and that cannot happen again.
Survival is simple, but it comes with a sacrifice.
Bite down on the device in your mouth,
which will start the motor that will rip your fingers away…
-[screaming] -…leaving you free to escape with your life.
But if you don't act quickly, all that awaits you is this watery tomb.
Live or die, make your choice.
Hey, Kraus, anything special about the bridge where we found the fingers?
Yeah, why that bridge?
It was where he shot that kid, Jimmy Lincoln.
[Zeke] Then how did you guys find out about this place?
This guy, Benny Wrights, who Boz was last seen with on July 4th.
How do you know who Boz was last seen with?
We took it off a pawn shop feed in Stuart Point. And you didn't tell me.
Who the fuck did this? Somebody who has it out for the Metro PD.
Or maybe just for Fitch.
You trying to say something, Drury? You know what I'm saying.
I doubt you'll be shedding tears for Fitch. All right, come on. Come on, Zeke.
[Zeke] Fucking asshole.
Okay, ignore him.
Did you get anything?
Got a name. Benny Wrights. Last guy Boz was seen with.
Okay, find him, and you got hours, not days.
[Zeke] And this is where Benny gets his meth.
You know what that is?
[Schenk] Is this a test?
-Just asking you a question. -Uh, it's a meth house.
You put the money in the bucket, the meth comes down.
Oh, somebody watched The Wire.
This is some New Jack City shit. Goddamn.
Don't we need a warrant for this? What you talking about?
Zeke…
[Zeke] Hey, my man, my man. Just trying to get a five, me and my lady!
It's our anniversary, we're trying to celebrate, trying to do something special.
Can I get a five? How about this iPad?
It's got everything on it.
I got passcodes, I got Netflix, Hulu,
uh, Uber Eats, Postmates. Lots of food, lots of food.
Let me see that…
Yo, man, get the fuck out of here. Do I look fucking hungry to you?
Do I look fucking hungry to you? Yo, yo, it got everything. It don't fit, though. Why don't you come down?
Get the fuck out of here! Come back when you get some money!
Okay, okay. I need money, I need money. No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait!
I got some, I got some money. I got some money, hold up a second. Hold up a second, all right?
All right, send it down, baby. Come on, come on, let's do this.
Can't wait!
[Schenk] Zeke, what the fuck? [Zeke] It's got 10 seconds, come on! [Schenk] Jesus Christ.
[groans] What the fuck?
-Move! -Get out of the way.
Out of my way, out of my way! Police!
[man] Five-o!
-Everybody, five-o! -Move, move, move! Come on! Go! Coming through.
[man] Fucking cops, man.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Shit! Get your dog!
-[man] Fuck you, man. -Get your fucking dog!
-Now! -Hey, be nice.
Jesus Christ.
Holy fucking shit.
What the fuck's going on? [Schenk] Back inside. Get back inside.
[man muffled] Hide your shit!
-[woman screaming] -[drug dealer] Come on!
Fuck. Fuck!
[drug dealer] My fucking leg! Why do you make this shit so hard?
What if I really wanted to get fucked up? [drug dealer] Motherfucker…
[drug dealer] Motherfucker… You got to make it easy for the customer, skeeve!
That leg is fucked up.
Let me get a shot for the Gram. Hold on for one second. [drug dealer] What the fuck… [Zeke] Hold on, hold on.
My man.
Here we go! You want me to tag you? [drug dealer] Fuck… Fuck you.
-Can I tag you, motherfucker? -Fuck you…
You see this man before? I ain't telling you shit!
Why, 'cause you're worried about that bone sticking out your leg?
Why don't you let me sterilize it? No… No… No! Fuck!
It's Benny! Stop, please!
Everybody knows that motherfucker Benny Wrights!
He's one of my best customers, man.
When was the last time you saw him? I ain't seen the bitch in two days, man.
Word on the street is that motherfucker OD'd.
[Schenk] Fuck this snitch.
[Schenk] Well, that was a waste of time. Well, we know Benny's dead.
Meth isn't the type of thing you take a break from.
Besides, you see that device?
That was not designed by anybody with rotten teeth.
What do you think about this whole Jigsaw angle?
You think it's a, what-do-you-call-them, one of those disciples? John Kramer didn't target cops.
Whoever did this has another motive. Something personal.
And they're not following orders, especially the orders of a ghost.
Ghost or not, somebody's out there pulling all the strings.
You think this guy sent you the boxes
because you're the lead detective on the case, or because you're you?
I don't know. Well, you got any enemies? That aren't cops?
Well, you got any enemies? That aren't cops?
[man] I don't know why she won't give me another chance.
I don't know, maybe it's because you beat her when you drink too much.
You ever think of that?
That's some tough love. Who the hell is this guy?
Ex-cop. Partner snitched on him,
had to do nine years hard time.
The system spit him out, now here he is.
Hey, Pete.
Zeke.
Last guy I expected to see here.
You trying to get sober? Alcohol's not my problem.
The glass and the bottle can kill.
How you doing, Pete?
Eighteen months sober, living in a church basement, who could ask for anything more?
Who's this?
Detective Schenk. We're working a case together. [Pete] Working together?
Don't let this guy catch you jaywalking, or he'll stab you right in the fucking back.
Don't forget, Pete, you gave me the knife.
You're right, I did.
And you witnessed this cop throw the victim off a rooftop?
And you saw it, I mean, with your own eyes? And you can positively ID this cop?
He's had his foot on the neck of this community for way too long.
We can't have this.
I'll testify, Officer Dunleavy. I'll do it.
Pete! Pete! What happened? What happened?
He pulled a gun on me.
The witness pulled a gun on you?
I was mad for a long time, but now I take responsibility.
I should have never pulled the trigger.
The guy had a family.
It was crazy back then, right?
We were working under Article 8.
We were out of control.
We were out of control. Cops were given their own discretion to crack down on crime.
Where were you July 4th at 9:30 p.m.?
Really? That's what you're here for?
That's what I'm here for.
Look, some guy came to a meeting drunk
and wanted to fight a sponsor, so I hit him. Knocked him clean out.
Anyway, the cops came. I'm still on probation, but lucky for me, it was O'Brien.
He let the whole thing slide because, you know…
loyalty.
Loyalty.
Take care, Pete.
God loves you, Zeke.
More than you.
[Schenk] Can't believe that guy used to be a cop.
He shot an innocent guy, but you turned on him?
There's a code, and you better learn how to follow it,
or you're going to spend the rest of your life watching your back.
Fair point. Maybe it's a good thing they made us partners.
[Banks on voicemail] Leave a message.
Yeah, Dad, I'm at your apartment. I was here last night.
It doesn't look like you've been home.
All right, give me a call.
[Schenk on voicemail] You've gotten through to William, leave a message after the beep.
Schenk, it's 9:00 a.m., where the fuck are you? Give me a call.
[Jeannie] Just tell me what happened, okay?
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Put the box on the ground! On the ground! Hands up! Hands up!
On the ground now! Hands up, hands up!
Don't move!
Get him out of here.
Take him to holding.
[Jeannie] I'm sorry, Banks, he blew right past me.
No way, Zeke, that one is not the same. I'm calling the bomb squad.
Angie, you're the head of the department. We got two dead cops, there's no time.
Get everybody out. Everybody out! Everybody out!
Everybody, go!
-Is that fucking skin? -Ugh.
[Zeke] "Am I getting under your skin, Detective Banks?
"Careful, while you're looking for more bodies to drop,
"I'll take your head." "I'll take your head…"
"Am I getting under your skin… "Am I getting under your skin…
…family. This is my wife, Emma, this is my son, Charlie.
What the fuck is that?
Captain, there's something under here.
Constantine Paints.
[O'Brien] Thanks, yeah.
[officer] Follow me.
[O'Brien] How do you know about this place?
Zeke, how do you know about this place? My dad used to take me here.
Watch your step, gentlemen. It wasn't always a butcher shop.
Used to be Constantine Trains.
Like a hobby shop.
[O'Brien] Oh, my God.
-[Zeke] Anything? -[camera shutter clicking] [forensics] Well, we're analyzing the tape recording.
[distorted voice on tape] Hello, Detective Schenk, I want to play a game.
You were head of your class at the Police Academy.
He was obviously skinned…
postmortem.
Your dad's the reason I wanted to do this in the first place.
[forensics] …the body was scored first to remove the pieces in larger strips,
arms, neck, as he ripped the skin…
Maybe it's a good thing they made us partners.
[forensics] Even the defensive wounds, he clearly tried to fight back,
which explains the deeper gashes.
[reporter] Captain, over here. Is it a serial killer targeting cops?
Is the victim inside a policeman?
No comment. Commissioner Hart will make a statement tonight.
We got to try to keep his identity out of the press until I tell his wife.
[Zeke] "Am I getting under your skin, Detective Banks?"
Hey, O'Brien. [O'Brien] Yeah, boss?
You seen Zeke?
No, not for a while.
Okay, I'm heading down to Cold Case. Copy that, Captain.
[dispatcher] I need all available units, officer down 3rd and Beaman.
Please report, 3rd and Beaman.
[Zeke] What do we got?
I was writing a ticket and some guy in a pig's mask, he runs up on me with a knife.
So, he stabs your arm and just takes off?
[voice breaks] I fought him off the best I could and he… He took off running.
Is there any reason he would have to attack you?
No. He just wanted to mess with the cops.
"Careful, while you're looking for more bodies to drop,
"I'll take your head."
Angie, you're the head of the department.
Angie… Ah, fuck!
-[line ringing] -Angie! Pick up!
[on voice mail] Hey, you've reached Captain Angie Garza, leave a message at the tone. Thanks.
Angie, get to the bullpen! He's coming for you.
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Shit!
Hello? Hello! Shit!
Help! [echoes] Help!
[distorted voice on tape] Hello, Captain Garza. I want to play a game.
You have covered up corruption in your department,
never sticking your neck out for the innocent.
Now, the cover-up will be on you.
In a few seconds, boiling hot wax will be coming out of the pipe above you.
The only way to stop yourself from being suffocated
is to sever your spinal cord with the blade beneath your neck,
which will stop the wax.
You cannot walk away, -but you can survive. -[warning buzzer]
Live or die, make your choice.
[Garza screaming] Fuck you!
Angie! Angie!
Get the fuck out of the way! -[screaming] -[sizzling]
How come no one is answering the phone? An officer was attacked, it's fucking chaos in here.
[Zeke] Angie! Angie!
Angie?
Zeke, what's going on? [Zeke] He's got her!
Who's got her? The killer has Angie!
I guess you didn't hear, the killer just attacked a cop at 3rd and Beaman.
That was just a diversion to get us out of the precinct.
She's down in the fucking basement!
Did you find Angie? In the basement, in the basement!
[woman on PA] Captain Angie Garza, call the front desk.
[Zeke] Open it!
Hurry up!
Angie!
Open it! Okay.
Shit!
It's okay, it's okay. It's gonna be fine.
Oh, my God.
It's okay. It's okay… Oh…
[Zeke] Lock it down. You understand me?
Lock it down, nobody gets out of this precinct.
I need all the footage from the cameras in the evidence room.
[officer] Okay, here… Here's when the call came in,
but then there's nothing until you come in.
You see right there, it jumps from 13:11 to 13:24. Glitch?
No, there's no glitch, because look, on the first frame, the safe door is open,
but on the next, it's shut. There's 13 minutes missing.
Access to this footage, is that through the computer system?
Yeah, we just need a badge number and a password. I can't tell you who deleted the video,
but I can access who logged into the server over the past day.
O'Brien, Tupper, Nicholazi…
Wait… Who's badge number 2-1-3?
Pete Dunleavy, my old partner.
Dunleavy? He shouldn't have access.
How long's it been since he was even on the job?
Where you going?
To pay Pete a visit. Zeke, he's not the only one!
Your father had access, too.
Location of Schenk's body, you said it was where your father took you as a kid.
When was the last time you saw your father?
-This morning. -Bullshit.
[Zeke] Motherfucker! [Jeannie] What the fuck, Zeke?
[Zeke] Fuck you, man! -[O'Brien] Fuck you! -Get the fuck out of here!
Get him out of here! Fuck you! You're too close!
You're too close to this thing, Zeke.
Pete!
Pete!
Pete!
[Banks on voicemail] Leave a message.
Dad, I've called you three times, please call me back!
People are asking questions and I'm sick of making excuses.
You got something to tell me? Fuck!
You wanna play games, motherfucker?
All right, I'll play.
You okay?
Help!
Pete?
Pete, wake up.
Pete!
What? Zeke? Fuck.
Get me the fuck down, Zeke. Come on!
You hacked the computer.
You erased the surveillance footage. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Zeke.
-Did you kill Angie? -What?
Did you kill Boz? What the fuck are you talking about?
[shouts] Did you kill Boz? Boz? Fuck…
What the fuck is with you, Zeke? Get me the fuck out of here!
Is this some sick fucking revenge, Zeke? Putting me in jail isn't enough, huh?
Get me the fuck out of here!
[distorted voice on tape] Hello, Detective Banks. I want to play a game.
When Peter Dunleavy murdered an innocent man,
your career was shattered like glass.
Can you stand on the sidelines while justice is finally served?
There is a way to save him,
or you can keep him locked up and throw away the key.
The decision is yours.
"Throw away the key," what the fuck? -[warning buzzer] -Huh?
Get me the fuck out of this thing.
Zeke!
Oh, shit.
[Pete] Come on, Zeke.
Get me the fuck out of here, Zeke!
Shit!
Zeke! Help me!
Zeke?
Get me down, come on, man.
Zeke!
Zeke!
[distorted voice] …or you can keep him locked up and throw away the key.
Pete!
I'm coming, Pete!
[Zeke] Shit.
Fuck. I got you, I got you.
Come on, Pete.
Pete! Pete!
[Zeke] You disloyal piece of shit.
I've been loyal to you since the first day we met.
Fifteen years ago.
The day your partner killed my father.
So, Charlie, you saw this cop throw the victim off a rooftop,
and you can positively ID this cop?
I'll testify, Officer Dunleavy. I'll do it.
[Zeke] Pete! Pete! What happened, what happened?
[Pete] He pulled a gun on me. The witness pulled a gun on you?
Shh. Pete killed Charlie Emmerson. What? You thought I'd use my real name?
Do you have any idea how hard it was to get placed in this department,
to get assigned to be your partner?
What about your family, what about your son?
[Schenk] This is my son, Charlie.
I don't have a son.
Charlie's sleeping… -[baby crying on laptop] -…was sleeping.
-[baby crying on laptop] -…was sleeping. After Benny Wrights led Boz down the subway tunnels…
I tattooed my dad's name on his arm.
Where is my father?
You'll see him soon.
[shouts] Where the fuck is my father?
I didn't even ask him to come down here. You did.
Let me borrow your phone, shut up. [Zeke] Okay.
Thank you.
[Zeke] And don't drain my battery watching Twilight.
Where is he?
Don't you want to hear my offer? Do I have a choice?
I want to be partners.
You took a stand, Zeke, against a dirty cop, and what did it get you?
A lifetime of watching your back, working alone.
Getting the call for every homeless bum who turns up dead.
I mean, let's be real, some of these motherfuckers are straight up evil.
Fitch not backing you up…
-Fuck him. -[gunshot]
He won't repeat that mistake.
And Boz, always lying under oath…
But you, you're different.
You're Metro's finest.
That's why I want to team up with you on this.
You find the dirty cops and I'll take care of the rest.
You want me to help you kill cops?
No, fuck no. Just the bad ones.
John Kramer was right, the spiral.
A symbol of change, evolution, progress.
But why limit that to an individual when you can apply it to a whole system?
You got shot for doing the right thing. But let's face it, these cops?
They're not going to clean up on their own. But we take a tongue here,
a few bones there, they'll come around.
We're going to fix a broken department. Okay?
You and me. Okay.
Okay. Let's do it.
I want to trust you. I do.
I'm in. But my dad goes free.
One second.
[dispatcher] 911, please state your emergency.
Hello, uh, I'm at the old soap factory on Madigan Lane.
There's a crazy guy with a gun, he's firing it everywhere. Please hurry!
What the fuck was that?
[Schenk] You better hurry, Zeke, SWAT's on the way.
Look, I want to believe you, I do.
I want to trust you.
Take this, you'll need it. Come on.
Let's go see your dad.
It's time for your final test.
[Zeke] Dad. Ezekiel.
Oh, shit! Get him down!
Oh, shit.
I got you, Dad. [Banks] Zeke. Help me, son.
Don't worry, don't worry.
I'm not going to let you die. I will get you down.
It's all right, just hold on. Shoot this motherfucker right now.
Get him down! Get him down now!
I thought we were partners. You going to shoot me, Zeke?
With your one bullet?
Bad idea. It kills your dad.
He took a shot at me, by the way. Missed.
I wasted four. That means you got one shot left, Zeke.
All right, cops are here. That gives us four minutes.
Do you know there's 1.5 gallons of blood in the human body, Zeke?
At the rate your old man is bleeding out,
in just three minutes, those jars will be full
and your dad will be dead.
The only thing that can set him free is the bullet in your gun fired at that target.
is the bullet in your gun fired at that target.
Either way, I've got a foolproof way out of here.
You're not Jigsaw.
That's the game.
Shoot me and you both lose. Shoot the target and we both win.
You want to play? [Banks] I'm dying, Zeke, end it now.
[officer 1 on radio] In this corridor. [officer 2] Roger that. Southwest entrance.
[officer 1] Going through the south door.
Nothing here. Keep moving.
[Schenk] I need you all in.
Dunleavy ruined both our lives and you tried to help that piece of shit?
-Zeke! -Pete!
You failed that test. Now I need you to choose who you're really with. The man who corrupted the force,
The man who corrupted the force, or the one who's trying to save it.
You want to tell him, Chief?
Tell me what?
Tell him about all the fucking shit you did under Article 8.
What's he talking about? -Time's running out. -What's he talking about?
-Time's running out. -What's he talking about? Citizens were dying.
We did what we had to to clean up the streets.
[Pete] It was crazy back then, right?
We were working under Article 8, we were out of control.
Murder rate went way down. [scoff] That's fucking bullshit.
People felt safe again.
The streets got cleaner because the cops got dirtier.
Your dad oversaw the whole thing, by the way.
Innocent people getting shot, all in the name of justice.
Article 8 was one of the most corrupt police policies in history,
and guess who was your dad's right-hand man? Sorry, or should I say woman, the whole time?
We'll handle it. We always do, huh?
Angie? Angie! It was Angie.
I mean, not a massive surprise.
You think it was her stellar reputation that got her a precinct at age 35? Come on.
Shoot this piece of shit, Ezekiel. Now.
[Schenk] Yeah, that's right, because that's what cops do. Shoot first, ask questions later.
You watched my father die and I'm trying to save yours.
If we're going to trust each other, I need you to do this.
[Banks] Ezekiel…
You've always done the right thing, do it now.
This piece of shit is killing cops.
[Schenk] You still need to decide,
you can shoot me, or… Or you can save your dad.
Clock's ticking, man. Think fast.
Cavalry's coming.
But not in time to do any favors for your old man. Only you can do that.
Dad? Dad?
[officer] Shots fired!
Zeke… Zeke.
[Zeke] It's going to be okay. [weakly] He's getting away. Don't let him get away.
Don't let him get away.
Go… Go!
Stop. Don't come in. Don't come in.
Oh, God.
Whoever did this has another motive, something personal.
Whoever did this…
…they're pulling all the strings.
Your dad is the reason for all of this. He's why I wanted to do this in the first place.
I've been dreaming about this since I was 12 years old.
What the fuck is going on?
-[officer 1] Go, go, go! -[officers shout]
Get down! Get down now! [officer 2] Let me see your hands!
No! No, no, stop! No! God!
[officer 2] Freeze! [Zeke] No, no!
No! [officer] Put it down!
-Hi. -Hey.
That's right.
Yeah.
Good morning, young ladies.
There are eight more weeks until the audition.
Remember,
the New York Ballet Academy chooses only one you for the scholarship.
This is your big chance. Don't waste it.
We will start with the solo variation of Sleeping Beauty.
Aurora's Birthday.
Katya, s'il te plaît.
-Hello. -Hello.
Hello. Your hat.
Watch out, Paul. Not so fast.
Quiet, Paul. Dad is still busy.
Keep quiet.
…in general, are great for a dancer.
-But in this intensive-- -Dad!
Pauly! Come here. Fly in!
Does he want to follow in his father's footsteps?
-We'll see. He'd rather score goals. -Yes.
But don't worry.
The next Orlow is waiting in the wings.
Oh, yeah?
-Hi, Dad. -How are you?
Let's take a family photo for the newspaper.
Here, my source of pride.
Hey, it'll be great. Break a leg!
See you later.
All right.
See you later.
You'll do well.
The big jump tonight is just for you.
Break a leg, Dad!
Thank you.
-Hey, Katya. -Hey.
Nice to see you.
Unbelievable how much you look like your mother.
How's New York going?
-Yeah, it's going okay, thanks. -Wow.
We're all hoping that it'll work out.
It's all your dad talks about.
Oh, God.
Three weeks left.
From now on, ballet is your whole life.
Every free moment will be spent training, no breaks, no distractions.
I just wanted to say how incredibly strong you are.
Three years ago with your mother and now this.
I still can't believe it.
So crazy. I saw him dance just a few weeks ago.
What does it matter? It was all in the papers.
Orlow's successor is waiting in the wings.
With that name, it doesn't matter how you dance.
Just shut up, Janine.
What is Paul doing?
Paul, what are you doing?
What? I'm getting ready so Dad can fly with me.
Come on, not now.
-Dad! -Paul!
Hello.
You must be Paul, right?
-Hello. -Hello.
I'm Mrs. Nemec from outpatient home care.
I'll be here every day
until your dad is back on his feet.
Dad!
Hello.
Love you.
Nice to see you. Check it out…
I have four legs now. Cool, right?
Hi, Dad.
Can we fly now?
Maybe a bit later, okay?
Okay, young man. You can fly ahead and show me the apartment.
Here's the kitchen…
Hey.
So?
How was it?
Everything okay?
Of course.
Grandma took great care of everything.
Good.
She knows a trick to get Paul into bed earlier.
Really?
Mrs. Rosebloom sends you her warmest regards.
And Dad, she's sure I'll get the spot in New York.
Well, of course.
We Orlows never give up.
Yeah. I'm going to make it.
It will be all right.
Okay?
Piece of shit!
Hey.
Hey, sweetie. You okay?
My bike is broken.
I'm sure it's not that bad.
Yo, girl. What's up? Are you stuck or something?
I'm good. Be there soon.
Karim can look at it.
Karim?
Our DJ. He'll fix it. Easy.
Yo, man. What's up?
Welcome to Battle-Land, our after-hours club. Not bad, eh?
Karim! Can you take a look at the bike later?
Paul!
What are you doing here?
Did you dream about Mom again?
No.
Hey.
What's wrong?
I'm scared.
What are you scared about?
Dad.
We both have to be really nice to him.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
But for how long?
Look.
Just remember what Mom said.
Then everything will be okay again.
Can I still sleep in here?
Of course.
But no snoring, okay?
Arms a little bit higher, Janine.
Is everything okay at home?
Great.
Something special is radiating from you today.
Go home.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
-Really? -Yeah, awesome idea.
Very good.
-Hey. -Hey, it's you again.
I'm here for my bike.
Of course. I'll be back soon, okay?
It was so busy. I couldn't find you.
So crazy.
Hey. Be careful with the brakes.
Karim tightened them up.
-What is this place? -The Battle-Land?
It's like a big playground for me. No matter who, where from, how old,
when, how long…
It's definitely the right place to dance and hang out.
I'm about to teach a class. Come dance with us.
Yeah? Come on.
This is Katya.
-Hi, Katya. -Hey.
Pick a spot, and we'll get started.
Yo, what's up?
Look.
There's that girl.
Okay.
Turn around, Katya.
-Oh, man. She's good. -Yeah, in the flow. That's what I said.
Yeah.
-Yeah, I'm happy about this, man. -She's good!
-Yeah. -Good job!
Good.
Yo. Hey, Stargirl.
Are you messing with us?
So shy last night. Now you put on a show.
-Should've told us you're a transformer. -Transformer?
-Does she look like a car? -It's a metaphor.
-Meta… what? -A metaphor. M-E-T-P-O-R.
Metaphor?
-With an F. -Huh? Where's the F?
What F?
-Hey. -Hey.
I saw you dancing.
Well, it was my first time.
I noticed.
Wow.
Show me again.
What?
How you dance.
In here?
Okay.
No, not that. The other way.
What other way?
How you just danced before.
It was exactly the same.
Okay.
All right, then.
There was a new kid today.
-Really? What's his name? -Tim.
When I asked if he played soccer, he said, "No, just chess."
-You know it? -Chess? Never heard of it.
Come on. The castles go left and right, and attack the king.
So it's a bit like soccer, just on a smaller field.
Then you can castle…
-Are you okay? -I'll tell you later.
Yeah.
I need to prepare something for Mrs. Rosebloom.
For tomorrow.
Okay.
Hey, everyone. What's up? I'm going to show you my favorite dance moves.
Get ready. I'm…
Hey, you.
So?
Everything okay?
Yeah. Why?
Just asking.
I wanted to see how it's going.
Making progress?
If I can help you--
Yeah, not yet. I still need a little time.
Okay.
I'll leave.
Maybe you'll show me what you're working on.
I will.
Cool.
Different enough?
Wow. You really got it.
You always go straight for the best?
Those are Lil' Lad and Casey Rock's moves, right?
Of the Sonic Tigers.
Best street dance crew in the world.
That's their choreography. They created it.
What you did is "biting."
Copying a dance.
Huh?
What's wrong?
You gonna stand there forever?
What's wrong?
Fear of heights?
This is dance.
It's like electricity.
It starts in your gut, rushes through your whole body,
and then bursts out of you.
You get it?
You don't?
Hey, check this out.
Come on, do it.
Are all you guys this smug with your stupid street dance thing?
What?
You wanted to know, no?
It was obvious.
Get your cool moves for the internet somewhere else.
This place is for real dancers.
Is this what you call dance?
Is this what you mean?
Finally, good.
-Do you have a screw loose? -What do you want?
You think people will go crazy because you nailed 30 moves?
Moves you stole from someone?
You don't get it, do you? It's about what you make of it.
Doing your thing.
You have to pull off your own style.
And…
El Kid was also pretty crappy at first.
But we'll get it. I'm here every afternoon.
Yeah. Go!
This much.
You must experience Sleeping Beauty with every fiber of your body.
Only then can you feel the importance of the kiss
that frees her from her hundred-year sleep.
Katya?
-Hey. -Hm?
Orlow needs more than a kiss.
Come on, faster.
Okay.
You were faster.
-Yeah. -Just barely.
Not bad for a ballerina.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm good.
-Hey, Jo. -Hey.
In dance, trust is A as in "all right"
and the O as in "okay." Okay?
Okay.
Then, turn around,
close your eyes
and fall.
I'll catch you, bro.
ONE NEW MESSAGE
YOU ARE CRAZY GOOD. THE ALIEN.
Mrs. Rosebloom.
Katya.
You're not ready yet.
I can't come in the next few days.
My dad's back in the hospital.
Hopefully, it's nothing serious.
They're taking the splint off and checking that everything is okay.
Darling, the audition is in seven days. You know that.
And quite frankly, you're not at your best.
You're not concentrating, tired.
Should I talk to Victor?
Please don't.
He really needs me.
Two days.
Not a day more.
And promise me you'll practice every chance you get.
Come on, Marlon. Let's go.
Yeah, let's go.
-Alien! -Alien!
Hey, yo!
Come at me.
Yo, take it easy, man.
Respect, man. That was sick. For sure.
-Thanks, man. -What now?
You gonna moonwalk for that girl?
-Calm down. -Go away.
-What? -Get out of here.
This dude.
-Respect, man. -Thanks.
Look out for our Stargirl. We discovered her.
-Yeah, got it. -Okay?
But dope session today.
-Stargirl. -Hey.
And you look out for our Alien.
-Got it. -Aye?
-Pepper. -Aye-aye.
-What's up? -Where are you?
See you tomorrow?
"Stargirl."
All right.
"Alien."
Wow.
Okay.
Marlon?
I'm hungry.
How long have you done ballet?
No idea. Ever since I can remember.
It can't have been that long.
Wow.
No, really, how long?
Fifteen years, maybe?
Are you for real?
That's your whole life.
Yeah.
How does it feel being a ballerina?
It's super cool.
Sometimes it's like flying.
Like a little duck?
Watch.
And why do you dance so well?
I taught myself.
Of course, what else?
-Kidding. -Really?
When I was little, I saw a guy dancing on the street. Ali Fazer.
He came alone as a kid to Germany from Lebanon. He had nothing. He only had dance.
He had nothing. He only had dance. Now he leads the world's best crew.
The Tigers.
Making the group would be really awesome.
They're touring in the US and Australia,
like one big family.
Why do they all call you Alien?
Stop!
Hey! Stop!
-Oh my God! -Come back here!
Run!
Watch out!
You?
Hey!
Hey!
You can do it!
Let's go!
Damn it, Katya.
-Where were you? -Sorry.
And look at you!
Get those clothes off. I'll warm up your food.
Thanks.
By the way, your father called.
Shit, what did you say?
The truth, of course.
You were at a friend's place doing school work.
Thank you.
You can tell a lot about a person by the company they keep.
Now, hurry up!
Paul.
Are you asleep?
Pauly.
What if I do something new?
Like what?
Like hip-hop maybe.
Those guys on TV recently, you know it?
No more ballet.
Just do both. It's dumb to always do the same thing.
Even kindergartners know that.
Smart aleck.
A dancer's body is a tool.
It serves a greater purpose.
Absolute beauty, perfection.
The slightest shakiness or carelessness
and the magic vanishes forever.
The break didn't heal properly.
That's what they said.
The doctors say I'll never dance again.
That's totally okay.
Yeah, we already knew.
I have to talk to you.
Hey, Katya. Me too.
-Stargirl, you haven't heard yet! -The Tigers are coming.
We can audition for their show next week.
If you make the cut, you tour with them.
Rio, Tokyo…
New York, man.
These huge cities, bro. Yes!
-That's so dope. -Should we go for it?
You and me as a duo.
You want to?
Katya!
What was that?
Shit!
Katya! What is it? What did I do wrong?
Leave me alone, Marlon!
-Katya, what's up? -I don't want to anymore, damn it!
I just don't feel like it anymore.
Pliés, fouettés, battement tendus all the time. We are the great Orlows!
Isn't it just great?
Mom always said we can achieve anything if we stick together. Anything!
And it's true. I want it too,
but why does it feel so shitty? Man, this is so unfair.
Who am I really?
-Take a quick look at this. -Marlon, leave me alone.
-Please just look-- -What? Dude!
You can't be serious.
Who is this?
Come on, Marlon!
Yeah, exactly.
And who is that?
Me.
Of course.
Who else?
Then let's audition for these damn Tigers.
What?
I want to dance with you.
Victor.
Where's Katya?
-Hello. -Hello.
Your dad's here.
Where were you?
-I have to-- -Don't lie to me.
It's bad enough that you tell Mrs. Rosebloom stories.
I'm not lying to you.
I recently met some street dancers, and I'm training with them.
What?
-Next week, Marlon and I want-- -Who is Marlon?
We want to audition next week.
The Tigers are looking for a new crew, and if it all works out,
we'll come up with our own act and tour with them worldwide.
Wait a second.
What about the New York Ballet Academy?
Dad.
I love ballet so much, really.
But when I do hip-hop, everything is different.
I light up on the inside.
I've always asked myself what it is.
I finally know.
It's me.
I can't go back to ballet.
-I can also make it big in hip-hop. -Katya.
There's no way you're
traveling the world with some break-dancers.
-Yes, I will. -No!
Ballet…
is your family.
You have nothing else.
That's not true.
-Dad, I-- -Enough, Katya!
You're on the verge of realizing your dreams.
I won't let you just throw it all away.
-Dad, please. -Am I clear?
What am I supposed to do with you now?
All right.
I won't get in the way of your future.
There's no time to waste.
I will train you in the morning and your father in the afternoon.
The audition is in three days.
Katya.
We all have doubts.
Suddenly, an opportunity comes along and turns everything upside down.
You have to hold firm,
let it pass, and act
as if nothing happened.
Otherwise, you'll lose your way.
Get ready.
Hey.
All good?
We'll make it, right?
Please tell me we'll make it.
Hey.
We're Stargirl and Alien.
Of course, we'll make it.
Yo, man.
Exactly. Move, switch and…
And then…
-Oh, okay. Nice. -Yeah, good.
Let's change the spin here.
Yeah, that's good.
Hey.
Trust me.
Not bad at all!
But just so we're clear, the spot with the Tigers belongs to us.
See you tomorrow, right?
Yeah.
-I-- -I want--
-You fir-- -You fir-- Wow.
I think it's awesome that you, well…
ended up with me.
Me too.
I wanted to ask if you
if you…
only if you want to and have time… if you…
want to come to my place?
Of course.
-Just leave it there. -Okay.
Quiet.
May I?
Oh, oui.
-Careful. -Yeah.
Okay.
Here.
May I?
Where'd you get all this stuff?
Found it.
So pretty.
Really.
Wow.
Those are "The Steps."
The boys from "The Killaz."
That's "The Family" from France.
And who's that?
What?
Are you serious?
Only "The Boss."
Ali Fazer?
Are your parents okay with me being here?
Come. I'll show you something.
Come!
Got it! Don't want it.
There.
Those are brothers one and two, Fabian and Olli.
Henry Potter.
And…
Yeah!
We got Martin, Jeremy, Milo, and Hayat.
-Marlon is this a-- -Come, quick!
So, boys?
Everything good?
Where's Marlon?
-Marlon? -Marlon.
Marlon?
-Yeah. -You good?
Yeah, of course.
Can I come in?
No, I'm already in bed.
All right, sleep well.
-See you tomorrow. -See you.
Marlon, is this a home?
Yeah.
We call it a shared apartment.
Where are your parents?
No idea. I don't have any.
Very funny.
It's not a joke. I never met them.
-Why didn't you tell me? -What should I have said?
"Hey, I'm Marlon. I don't have any parents."
I know nothing about yours.
Does that change things between us?
No, of course not.
Then come over here.
Hey.
Can I ask you something?
They died trying to take a selfie at Niagara falls.
What?
Oh, man.
You're so gullible. What's up with you?
I've always made up stories about my parents.
That they're actors or a crazy gangster couple.
But you eventually realize… I was found, like all this stuff here.
Look at the clown in the front… the one with the broken leg.
I found him in the park.
But…
whether it was on some granny's table or belongs to someone else,
I don't know.
Just as I will never know who I got my eyes from.
Hey.
Hey. We're good.
Eventually, you know where you belong.
Hello?
No, Mrs. Nemec, she's not back.
Yes, the police said we should keep waiting.
Will do.
Good night.
DAD: PLEASE COME HOME 23 MISSED CALLS
WHERE ARE YOU?
PAUL AND I ARE WORRIED. WHO ARE YOU WITH?
Hey, Katya.
I'm preparing the documents for the Tigers.
I'm missing your parents' signatures.
Hey. Super cool what you've done with our Alien.
You two make a sweet team. The Tigers better get ready.
You'll bring the form tomorrow?
Of course.
Cool.
SONIC TIGERS AUDITION CONSENT FORM
LEGAL GUARDIAN'S SIGNATURE
Marlon?
Marlon.
I have to tell you something.
I can't audition for the Tigers.
What?
My dad is Victor Orlow, a huge ballet star.
My whole family is ballet, you know?
And in two days, there's an audition for the NYBA.
I'm supposed to compete, but…
I really don't want to go back to ballet.
I know I want to dance hip-hop.
Okay.
Hey. We'll go talk to him, okay?
Already tried that.
This is our dream, right?
You wanted it too, right?
Okay then,
we'll find a solution.
You can stay with me until the Tigers audition.
Marlon, that won't work.
Why not?
Look at me. We'll make it work.
You can achieve anything you want.
Marlon, he's my dad.
He's in here. That doesn't just stop, no matter where I go.
I wasn't just found.
What about us?
I think you will have to audition alone.
I've done everything alone my whole life.
You…
Forget it.
You don't get it.
-Yo, Alien! -What's up, bro?
-How's it going? -Fuck off!
Katya!
DON'T GIVE EVERYTHING UP! DAD
PARTICIPANT: KATYA ORLOW
Oh, sweetie.
Sometimes life is like a really dumb goat.
It wants to go over here, then over there, then…
it's stuck in the middle of the forest and…
doesn't know where to go.
And all it wants is to do everything right.
That's exactly when…
everything goes wrong.
You know what you do then?
You grab it by the horns and show it where to go.
And how do you do that?
You already know. You know exactly what to do.
No.
Yes, you do.
You have to fight,
sometimes for every little bit.
Whatever I do, I always hurt people.
Is that a good reason to abandon the goat in the forest?
You're the only one who knows the way.
I'm so scared that Dad and I don't love each other anymore.
Are you out of your mind? Hey.
Gee! That…
Hey.
Believe me, sweetheart.
Whatever happens, you will always love each other.
Do you remember when you and Mom took me to my first ballet class?
I wanted to stay in the car because I was so scared.
You picked me up and said I had no reason to be scared…
and that dancing is the most beautiful thing…
like flying.
When I'm out there with Marlon,
I finally know what you meant.
It really is like flying but much better.
Dad, I still need someone to hold me and tell me
that there's no reason to be scared.
All we have is us.
CONSENT FORM
It'd be so nice if you come tomorrow.
DAD
Where is Marlon?
-Marlon? -Yeah.
He left super early today.
Oh, man. Damn it!
-Katya! -Where's Marlon?
I haven't seen Alien in a while. You guys called off the audition.
No, we didn't. Here.
Shit!
Marlon!
Did you forget the audition?
-But-- -No buts. The Tigers won't wait.
Come here!
-Let's go! -Check which pier.
Left. Remember your routine!
Fuck the routine!
DAD
There!
Okay, wait here.
Hey, there's Ali Fazer.
Hey.
-Jo! -Pepper!
Can't separate 'em!
Hey.
Sick, man.
Just a minute.
We'll show them.
Oh, two more from Battle-Land.
Cool. Go for it!
Hey.
Do you trust me?
Of course.
Stargirl and Alien!
How awesome was that, man? That was so dope.
I'll be damned! That was sick!
Go on. I know where to find you.
-…down the Mississippi-- -Hey.
-There you are. -Hello.
So nice that you're here.
Come here.
Hey.
This is Marlon.
Respect.
Truly well done.
Thanks, man.
How crazy is this?
Alien, what's up?
Yo, didn't you hear?
You did it. The Tigers want you.
-Yeah, man. Rio, Tokyo, New York! -New York!
You'll be there!
Oh my God!
-...and we'll start generating. -[dial clicks]
John has a very special mission in life.
He is trying to contact aliens.
It was started by myself. My grandfather helped me.
I lived with my grandparents in a small cottage in Northern Michigan.
I started building the electronic equipment to make contact
I started building the electronic equipment to make contact with whatever might be out there beyond the Earth.
It grew to encompass an entire bedroom.
That equipment continued to grow.
In the next two years, it was migrating into the living room.
It became more and more massive.
Most everything I did was self-taught.
I envisioned an idea and completed that vision,
built it into a physical reality.
I was always seeking to explore,
to look beyond what we have here.
I pictured many alien worlds,
imagining what it would be like to make contact.
The moment of sharing extreme knowledge and thoughts
and communication with another species, is just beyond anything most of us even imagine.
I seem to be picking up a radio signal.
Okay, fine.
[John] I decided that the best way to try and make contact
was to broadcast a signal into outer space.
I thought the best signal would be music.
Technically, we were achieving the actual transmissions
Technically, we were achieving the actual transmissions from a large tower out in front of my grandparents' home.
I sent music into space because it represents
I sent music into space because it represents a certain, uh, universal language.
And I'm talking about non-commercial music as such.
I'm talking about jazz, uh, electronic music... Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Harmonia,
Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Harmonia,
and there were many others.
African music,
Eastern music, which covers a broad area.
Reggae, Afrobeat...
And one of the things I really liked to send out was gamelan music.
It was a really beautiful form.
[reporter] John Shepherd has devoted all his time, money, and energies
to a personal search for outer space aliens.
[John on news report] I send cultural or creative music out into space.
I beam it out for approximately half a million, million miles out into space.
About twice the distance of the moon.
This is Project STRAT Earth Station One,
broadcasting to you from beautiful Northwestern Michigan.
You are listening to the group Harmonia.
This is Project STRAT Earth Station One signing off from another broadcast day.
If you ETs are out there, we'd like you to tune in again tomorrow night at nine p.m.
for more cultural music.
This is John Shepherd.
[John] I don't remember much about my mom.
Things were rough in the early years.
It wasn't the best home environment to raise me in.
My dad left while I was just born,
and my grandma felt sorry for me and took me with her.
I had very little contact with my mother.
She was always a little different than I was.
Almost... Not alien. That's not the right word, really.
Just different.
The fondest memories were after my grandparents adopted me.
Took care of me, raised me.
Sometimes taking the course that I have in my life and the path
is like a... maybe a lonely mountain road
to some higher elevation peaks, to see the view,
to check out something most people don't see.
So, you tend to go it alone more.
You don't have much company in this.
[John] I set up this whole operation inside of a small cottage
in the middle of a kind of sparsely populated area.
Small town, you know, rural.
My lifestyle, relative to the local lifestyle,
was quite, quite removed, quite different.
My mind was in space and in other realms,
where my body was in this local community,
this little... real quiet, peaceful area.
But my mind was traveling, traveling the cosmos.
Uh, probably 12, 14 years old, I realized that I was a little different,
that I was gay.
Growing up gay in Michigan was rather difficult.
That's one of the tougher realities, and especially in a rural area.
You don't get as much, well, shall we say, understanding.
You don't get as much of that.
I think the real tough part to deal with sometimes is loneliness.
You don't go right out and, so to speak, date somebody for very long
You don't go right out and, so to speak, date somebody for very long that they don't find out you're a little different.
To find someone that is on the wavelength that I am on
and be able to share my life with that person in any degree or way
and be able to share my life with that person in any degree or way is nearly impossible. Although I believe it exists.
is nearly impossible. Although I believe it exists. I believe for everybody there's someone.
As time went on, the equipment got consuming most of the house.
It became obvious that we needed more room.
My grandmother and I got together and pooled our funds to build an addition.
It had plenty of room to expand.
The project could be fully realized.
[male reporter] John Shepherd calls his project "STRAT."
That's an acronym for Special Telemetry Research and Tracking.
There are 60,000 volts running through his basement,
powering a signal that's beamed straight out into space.
[John] So, I built this two-story-high deep-space transmitter, basically,
a tuned circuit resonator.
It allowed me to reach deeper and further out into space.
Project STRAT had become a major operation.
I was busy developing other kinds of devices for communication.
I never gave up trying to make contact.
And the excitement, for me, was always there,
always the anticipation that something might happen.
We're now going to bring you some Afropop to warm up your evening.
[John] It was always an exploration. It was always a sort of a dream state.
So, I kept going. I kept doing that throughout... well, 25, 30 years of my life.
Can't say I found a lot of... hard data that would be of great significance, necessarily, on the UFO front.
that would be of great significance, necessarily, on the UFO front.
But as far as inspiration, creative ideas,
it gave me the chance to do all of that
and to share the results with people, with others.
And it filled my life. It gave it something, meaning.
What remains of Project STRAT is what's stored in this building.
A lot of the equipment is disassembled for storage,
but it's still here in its spirit, you might say.
And this was... [blows] ...one of the data mapping consoles.
There were endless components, all kinds of unique things.
Satellite communication equipment,
high-power microwave tubes that used to transmit microwaves.
So, it's lots and lots of stuff that was all parts of the lab,
including the high-voltage transmitter accelerator
that we used for sending signals into space.
So, these are just the remnants, or little leftover pieces of thought.
Well, having had to give up, due to lack of funds,
was deeply frustrating, almost depressing.
But also realizing that maybe it was time to move on.
I never really had any serious boyfriends or anyone that I went steady with, that sort of thing.
But in 1993,
I met somebody I really love very much named John Litrenta.
We were both at a club one evening. That's where we met.
When he first walked in the door of the club, I was still there...
I was quite... taken by his appearance.
His look... the fact that he was different.
There was an attraction almost immediately to the way he looked.
[John Shepherd] When I first met John, I had this impression that,
"This fellow's really kind of different. He gives me an interesting impression.
I think I wanna meet this guy."
It just came over me to go ahead and get up the courage to go over and say hello and introduce myself, at least.
And after that, it just seemed like... we were, well, we were off and running a bit, I'd say.
We started discussing music and some of the more obscure things we love about music.
John's character is really warm.
What I really like about him is that warmth and that understanding that he has.
Once I met him and realized that he was that sort of person:
warm, loving, sensitive, patient.
I was like, "Wow, that's really... That's really something.
You don't find that every day."
And that's what everyone, I think, in this world to some degree seeks
and doesn't always find it.
I was one of the lucky ones.
I feel I found it. Found it in John.
So, contact has been made.
My interest is in finding out the unknown, and the unknown is just that, unknown.
Just when I think about it...
it gives me chills.
Started from nothing.
It got stronger...
and stronger.
And it was always staring at me.
What is this "it" you are referring to?
It's a doll belonging to Lady Nid.
A monkey doll.
Yes!
That noise it made...
is still ringing in my head.
Every time I think about it,
it frightens me.
You need to relax and stay calm.
What you saw might be a manifestation of your own fears.
It was everywhere.
It could be anywhere.
It followed me,
and it was always watching me.
Madame.
I won't be able to work here anymore.
I'm being haunted.
And I saw a monkey.
It's everywhere.
And it's following me.
I would like to quit.
If you'd like to quit...
I won't stop you.
Then...
I will take my leave.
Chai.
Yes, Madame.
Please tell Wan to find me a new maid.
Yes, Madame.
Mommy?
The story that Ms. Phon told...
Is it true?
Ghosts aren't real.
This monkey will keep you company.
But...
But what?
The maid told me--
Stop talking nonsense, Nid.
I said ghosts aren't real.
I will find you a new maid.
Now sleep.
Close your eyes.
And then...
there was another woman.
A woman?
Had you met her before?
No.
I'd never known...
or seen her before.
She was so scary.
I can't describe her.
When I told other people,
they thought it was nonsense...
that I was seeing things.
They thought I was delusional.
What is FTD syndrome?
Frontotemporal dementia is a hereditary brain disorder.
There's a rare chance of this syndrome occurring in small children.
Is there anyone else in your family with dementia?
Definitely not in my family.
Later on, she might have forgetfulness, confusion, and hallucinations.
Sometimes she might see an imaginary friend
or something that scares her.
Both of you need to understand her condition.
Some people escape suffering...
by stopping time in their own world.
No matter how the outside world changes...
they...
still live in the time...
that they think...
is happy.
But in the end,
even though the world has stopped,
the pain...
still follows us.
Are you Joy?
Yes.
Sorry!
I guess I don't need to say much about how to behave in this house.
Before you came here,
I believe you've carefully read the duties of a housemaid...
required by this house.
Apart from that, just memorize the rules of this house,
and do your duties to the best of your abilities.
Most importantly,
you must not pry into others' business.
I believe you know what I mean.
Yes.
Don't worry, Ms. Wan.
I know how to behave.
I'm relieved...
that you're a quick learner.
Apart from the house chores, you need to take care of Lady Nid.
She is sick,
so she can't go out,
and she has never been out.
Introduce yourself to Lady Nid.
Hello, Lady Nid.
My name is Joy.
What are you drawing?
Pay no attention to that.
Lady Nid suffers from some mental illness.
She always thinks she sees things.
You will be staying at the cabin down the road.
I will have Chai take you there.
And don't be late tomorrow.
Madame doesn't like tardiness.
Yes.
And don't forget the rule:
stay out of other people's business.
Okay.
Here is your accommodation.
-I stay here alone? -Yes.
There might be something broken here and there.
If you find anything out of order here, report it to me.
I will fix it.
Can you stay here by yourself?
Oh?
Yes, I can.
Chai.
Why...
does this house have high maid turnover?
That's your maid uniform.
Don't forget to be ready early tomorrow.
I'll be going.
I got the job.
What job?
Maid for a foreigner's house?
You're going to be a maid there?
-Why? -Why the hell would you want to be a maid?
Unless...
This is Joy, Madame.
Hello.
Where else have you worked?
I used to work at a foreigner's house.
Sounds like a good job.
Why did you leave?
My employer returned to his country.
That house was sold.
Luckily, someone told me that this house needs a maid.
So I still have a job.
How many people are there in your family?
Four people. Me, Mom, Dad, and my cousin.
Do you know what to do around this house?
Yes, Madame.
I promise that I'll do my best.
I won't let you down.
We'll see.
No more dropping, Lady Nid.
I can't pick them up fast enough.
Let's have a nap. It's nap time now.
Come on.
Let's have a nap.
Come on. Let's go nap.
Come on.
Here.
Can I skip nap time, Ms...?
My name is Joy.
You need to take a nap.
Close your eyes.
Pick a place on those branches
Feel the breeze and rest
Sleep right here
In this nest
Feel the breeze and rest
Sleep right here in this nest
I'm so sorry!
Are you alright?
Are you new here?
Yes.
Name?
My name is Joy.
Joy.
Bhorn, you're hosting a concert again?
C'mon, Ms. Wan. I just want to create a cheerful workplace.
Joy, do you know this dance?
Poke and yank and poke and yank
No, I can't dance.
You're so outdated.
Joy!
Joy.
How's Lady Nid?
Sorry, what?
One day, I'll throw your mobile phone away.
Ms. Wan, wait. I'm still paying for it. Don't throw it out.
It's not fun if it's not loud.
Why does it have to be so loud?
Take it, Joy.
It's from the Madame.
Didn't she give it to you?
Ms. Wan's diabetic.
She's on daily injections, so she can't eat it.
She wants us to share it.
Bhorn already had a lot.
Look at me.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Has you mum ever taken you out?
No.
And your dad?
No.
You've never gone out?
If you got a chance, where would you like to go?
Anywhere, as long as I get to go out.
Lady Nid.
Do it softly.
Just then, did you see it too?
Can you read this book to me, please?
I sure can.
"Once upon a time, there was a farming family.
They had two daughters...
and the sisters loved each other so much.
Although they weren't rich,
they were happy with their lives.
One day...
the two were forced to be separated.
They were so sad."
You're going to be a maid there?
Why the hell would you want to be a maid?
Unless...
Lady Nid.
Lady Nid!
Ms. Joy.
I really did see it.
There's another woman living in this house.
It's true.
-I saw-- -Nid.
Stop talking.
What is that?
The woman I saw...
looks like the woman in this picture.
Where did you get this picture?
I found it on the floor when I was cleaning the library.
Wan, Bhorn, take Nid back to her room.
Yes, Madame.
This woman is not important.
So you want to know...
who she was?
Just another maid who used to work here.
Go rest.
-I said go! -Yes.
You look beautiful today, Madame.
You're the only one who compliments me.
If Master was here,
he would compliment you, too.
You know that...
he hasn't come home in days.
Because he doesn't have eyes for me.
That's not true.
You are so gorgeous.
There is no way Master can't see.
You have everything, Madame.
No, I don't.
Love...
I've never seen it in this house.
It's right here, Madame.
Everyone in this house loves you.
I love you, too.
Master must be busy with work.
Don't be resentful, Madame.
Yes, sir!
I am on my way.
Yes, sir.
My dad handled it for you.
I really want to know...
is there any problem you can solve yourself?
Where are you going?
I'm going to solve a problem myself.
Ms. Wan?
This person called Ploy...
how did she die?
Have you forgotten?
If you want to work here, do not pry into others' business!
-Bhorn. -Yes?
When you're done, bring it to the table.
Yes.
Bhorn.
What?
Can you tell me?
Tell you what?
About Ploy.
There's nothing.
She used to work here.
Then suddenly she left. It must have been five or six years ago.
Nobody has seen her since.
Oh, hey.
Besides, nobody has ever seen anything like what you saw last night.
But Lady Nid saw it too.
You can't believe Lady Nid.
She's just a child.
Maybe she was just talking to her fairy godmother.
Don't tell me you spent so much time with her
that she stopped seeing fairy godmother.
I'm leaving.
Can you please tell me about Ploy?
It has been a long time.
Just tell me what you can remember.
As far as I remember...
at that time, Ploy was just a maid
that the Madame hired to help out around the house.
Ploy took great care of the Madame.
She knew the Madame well.
When there was nobody in the house,
Madame always had Ploy beside her.
Ploy...
took away her loneliness,
and made her forget her sorrows.
Even Wan and Bhorn, who served her longer,
couldn't compete.
For the Madame,
Ploy wasn't just a maid,
but also a companion.
But in the end...
What happened in the end?
Ploy left the house...
without telling anyone.
Where did you get these drawings?
Where did you get the idea?
Where did you get it?
-You're hurting me. -Who told you to draw them?
Who told you to draw them?
Never draw these again.
I'm getting rid of these.
Never draw these again.
Never draw these again!
Who told you to draw them?
Tell me!
What are these drawings, Lady Nid?
Who told you to draw them?
Red is the Madame.
Black is the Master.
And who's the blue?
The maid.
I'm sorry, Ploy.
From that day...
until today,
all I can do...
is apologize.
No one wanted it to be like this.
Please forgive me, Ploy.
Why did you come in here?
I saw...
Just now I saw...
-I... -What did you see?
I saw...
Where did you get this?
Lady Nid.
You can leave now.
Okay.
You're good.
Did Madame teach you?
No, sir.
Would you like some tea?
Did Madame order you here?
It is my job.
I take care of everything she assigns me to.
So my orders are of no importance?
I'm your maid.
I loyally serve every master in this house.
You only try to please her.
If that were true, why did I bring you tea?
I see that you work late almost every night.
Take a sip. You'll feel more relaxed.
Enjoy, everyone.
I envy you
for having a beautiful and flawless wife like Uma.
It's me who's lucky to have married Nirach.
I envy you.
Nirach, you should take Uma to social events more often.
You know how important this is for my career future.
I won't talk.
Please, Uma. Just talk to your dad.
Master, would you take a sip of your tea?
Do you mind if I borrow some of your books?
No, go ahead.
The maid you told me about the other day...
Who is she?
Ploy.
Ploy...
Have you met Ploy?
Have you two met many times?
Where is she now?
Ploy, get me some tea.
Master,
I have something to tell you.
What is it, Ploy?
I'm pregnant.
Is this true?
Yes.
What's the important thing you wanted to tell me?
Uma,
I have something to tell you.
Ploy is pregnant.
I think it's a good thing.
So our house...
will have a child.
What do you think?
You're good.
You came here with nothing...
What else do you want?
Uma!
Once upon a time, there was a farming family.
They had two daughters...
and the sisters loved each other so much.
Although they weren't rich,
they were happy with their lives.
One day...
the two were forced to be separated.
They were so sad.
Are you Ploy?
Yes.
You are so gorgeous.
There is no way Master can't see.
You have everything, Madame.
Love.
I've never seen it in this house.
It is my job.
I take care of everything she assigns me to.
I'm your maid.
I loyally serve every master in this house.
It's right here, Madame.
Everyone in this house loves you.
I love you, too.
Master must be busy with work.
Don't be resentful, Madame.
This person called Ploy, how did she die?
She used to work here.
Then suddenly she left. It must have been five or six years ago.
Nobody has seen her since.

Sister, what happened to you?
Go away!
Joy asked to go to the market with Bhorn.
And the things we need for tonight?
You know that the Master takes this party seriously, right?
Yes, I do.
I've ordered some food from the hotel.
For hot dishes and drinks, Bhorn will make them herself.
Joy, do you remember how long you've been coming to see me?
About two years.
How are you doing?
Anything unusual that you'd like to tell me?
Nothing, I'm fine.
As far as I can see, your condition is stable.
I think it's a good thing.
And...
how's your job?
It's good.
I just got a new job not too long ago.
Why did you quit the last job? Can you tell me?
Let me go!
Don't hurt me!
Let me go!
My employer returned to his country.
That house was sold.
Do you still have insomnia?
No.
I have normal sleep.
Do you still have repetitive behaviors?
No.
I don't have anxiety either.
Sweets help me a lot.
If things continue this way, I think it will be good.
It has now been two years.
I'll adjust your medications.
Please take them regularly.
Yes, I will.
Doctor, am I well enough to care for children?
Children? Are you having children?
No.
I've found my older sister.
She wants me to help care for her child.
I'm glad that you've found your sister.
I don't think there should be any problem.
Bring your sister to meet me next time.
I will.
What took you so long?
You good-for-nothing.
Joy, when you're done with your stuff, come help me prepare for tonight.
We must hurry.
Yes.
Where did you go?
She waited so long that she complained.
What did you buy?
I went to a temple and a hospital.
That's why I've bought so much.
I need to use them soon.
-They have fireworks? -There's fireworks.
Wow. I wasn't expecting a party this big.
-So big. -Yes.
I saw foreigners. Can you speak English?
No, I can't.
Neither can I.
-Chai. -What?
The story you told me about Ploy,
is that all you know?
Yes.
Are you okay?
Are you looking for this?
Yes.
Take a deep breath.
I thought you said you didn't know anything about Ploy.
Hi. How are you?
The food is ready.
Would you like to add anything, Madame?
In a while, serve the wine that the Master prepared.
Tell Chai to prepare the car.
Some of the guests need a lift tonight.
Yes, Madame.
Where's Joy?
Helping Bhorn in the kitchen. She'll be out in a while.
You look gorgeous today.
How did you know I like red?
You wear red.
I think...
it looks powerful on you.
It's your birthday after all.
Thank you, Nirach, for arranging my birthday party.
How much have I paid?
Oh, you're awake?
How are you?
Well?
You know...
actually...
you shouldn't have lied to me.
You're the one who helped Chai wrap Ploy's body.
Be quiet, Bhorn.
Wow. Sounds like a lot of fun in there.
Be right back.
Chai.
Why are you sleeping?
Chai.
Oh!
Chai.
Chai.
Joy.
Are you alright?
Are you okay? Relax...
Would you like more wine?
Here you are.
Do you want more?
Here you are.
Did you get some?
Just a second. Here.
Am I too slow?
Sorry I'm slow.
The party is so much fun.
So many damn guests.
And today Madame is wearing her red dress.
She's so pretty.
I really like it.
The foreigners at the party are dressed up in fancy white clothes.
I want to dress like that too.
Too bad you didn't get to see it.
But it's fine.
Hey, listen to me.
We can have fun together.
What do you say? Okay?
Okay.
Come on. Turn this way.
Okay. What's your favorite song?
Poke and yank
That song, right?
Let's see. Where is it?
Found it!
Dance with me.
Dance.
Don't want to dance?
No? Okay.
Just kidding!
Just kidding!
Dance, quick!
Dance, quick!
Don't you like this song?
Sing it!
Dance like this?
Poke and yank and poke and yank
Hello, Madame.
Hello, Madame.
Hello, Madame.
Everyone.
I want to thank everyone for being here today...
on this special night,
for my special one...
the most important person in my life.
To my beautiful wife...
Uma.
The boss is okay with it.
He wants to talk to you.
Okay.
Me, too.
Where are you going?
Brief phone call. Take care of the party.
What are you doing?
Yes?
Nothing...
Where is Wan?
She's with Chai.
Take care of the guests for me.
I'm going upstairs.
Yes.
Is it going to work? How many votes will he get?
How is your business?
We are preparing to buy land.
If there's an offer one can't say no to, everyone will support him.
I have no problem.
Madame, you're staring at me...
as if you want to tell me something.
Yes.
You're Ploy's sister, right?
These are the letters that Ploy...
No.
They're the letters you wrote Ploy when you were young.
Ploy kept them well.
And this is Ploy's family photo.
You have a copy of it too, right?
Honestly...
if you wanted to know about your sister,
you didn't have to make up...
a ridiculous story.
I'm sorry, Madame.
Everyone told you already...
that Ploy...
left the house without telling anyone.
I didn't know where to find her.
I didn't know where she went.
Madame, do you know...
how horrible it feels to slowly suffocate to death?
I had no idea how painful it could be...
until Ploy told me about her experience.
You were merciless...
to leave Ploy to die like that.
I've had your favorite tea prepared since early this evening.
It's a pity...
that it's not hot anymore.
I love you too, Madame.
Thank you, sir, for taking care of everything.
It ended so well because of you.
Sir,
please let me explain.
Well...
I've already tried to talk.
Sir...
I don't want a promotion.
I don't want money.
I don't want a mansion.
And I don't want your daughter anymore.
I'm going to have a drink now.
Ploy.
Ploy.
Ploy.
Ploy!
Ploy.
Ploy.
Ploy.
Nid.
Nid.
Wake up.
Ms. Joy?
Aunt Joy.
