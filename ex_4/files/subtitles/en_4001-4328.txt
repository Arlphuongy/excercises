I always wanted to be a dad. It just took 46 years for it to happen.
When people ask me why, I tell 'em to fuck off.
Or I just say I hadn't met the right woman yet.
Ah, there she is. Leah.
Got the second one in the oven, and she still looks great.
According to her, the reason I got such a late start
is because I had an unhappy childhood.
But I'm not gonna whine about it.
That's what vegans do.
I'm just gonna make sure my kids are prepared for whatever this world has to offer.
[man 2] Slow down.
[man 1] Unfortunately, I have no idea what that is anymore.
For some reason, I can't leave my kid in the car
to run into a convenience store,
but that same store can sell him food so full of hormones
he'll be able to grow a beard by the third grade.
But nobody gives a shit
because they're too busy jerking off to Internet porn.
Buddy.
-What do you say there, Jackie boy? -[boy screaming]
-Oh, you motherfucking-- -You're up.
Goddamn. I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch!
Hey! Give me the stick! Give me the stick! Give me the stick!
Hey, buddy. What happened? You all right?
Colin pushed me.
Yeah, I know he did.
I told you if you play rough, rough things are gonna happen, right?
-Here, let me see. -[man 2] Colin, give me the stick!
Ah, that's not so bad. Just rub some dirt on it, buddy.
There you go.
You might wanna get him checked or at least put a little Neosporin on it.
That thing could get infected.
-Who are you? -I'm, uh, Hunter Lewis.
Lisa's husband. Just moved in across the street. Thanks for having me.
Oh, yeah? Are you a doctor, or are you just one of those WebMD guys?
It's just common knowledge. You wanna keep the cut clean.
Oh, is it? Listen, I'm trying to raise a little man here, not a fucking pussy.
So I appreciate your concern.
But why don't you just go back to your hard seltzer
and, you know, go on Twitter and go share the story where you're the hero?
[Hunter] Okay.
Daddy, you said a bad word.
Yeah, I know I did, buddy. Sometimes you have to, all right?
Don't tell your mother. She'll kill me. I love you. Come on. Let's get up.
[man 2] Hang on, Jack! Hang on! Hang on!
Colin's got something he wants to say to you, kid.
But, Dad, he pushed me first--
Hey, no, no, no. I don't care. Okay?
You don't hit somebody with a stick. We don't hit our friends.
Let's apologize now. Say you're sorry to Nate. Come on.
[screaming] No!
-[man 2] Hey, come on. Don't cry. -[screaming continues]
Come on. It's okay, buddy. Say you're sorry.
I'm just asking you to apologize. You don't gotta freak out.
-Hey, buddy. Ah, shit. -[screaming] No!
Okay, okay. What is going on? Why is he screaming?
Because he hit Nate with a stick, and I told him to apologize.
What you're feeling now is what you're feeling, okay?
Let it out.
-I don't think that-- -[woman 1] I don't need you to think now.
You need to respect your son's autonomy
and really let him process how crossing this boundary
is affecting his ever-evolving moral code.
I want my stick!
[fingers snap] Stick, where is it?
It's…
Jack. How's Nate doing in school?
Great, you know. He's comin' along. Uh, how's your little one doing?
He's great. He's perfect.
Yeah?
Come on, bro. I…
-[Colin] No! -Hey, hey, hey!
Jesus!
I'm gonna murder you. I swear to God. Let's go get a drink. Come on.
-How fucking sad is that? -He did it to himself.
[Jack] Yes, he did.
-[Colin] No! -[Connor] Come on, stop it.
Did you see that? That kid is a maniac.
Yeah, he's a lunatic.
I'm gonna say something to Cara. It's too much.
No, no, no. Don't say anything.
I'm not gonna freak out on her. I'm just gonna talk to her.
-Like, mom to mom. It's what moms do. -Mike, should she say something?
Three cardinal rules of friendship.
Don't bring up politics. Don't bring up religion.
And don't try to tell people how to raise their kids.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mike. I didn't realize you had your own daytime talk show.
Harvard. Duke.
Girlfriend, ex-wife.
-It's kinda airtight, honey. -Mmm, kind of. Not really.
What'd she mean by that?
Uh, she's just breaking your balls.
Look, we're happy for you guys.
We're wondering when you're gonna make an honest woman out of Britney.
I told you. She doesn't wanna get married. She doesn't wanna have kids.
All she wants to do is fuck me and go to the gym.
Goddamn, Mike. You found a fucking unicorn.
[Jack] What?
It's a team sport.
You okay, buddy?
♪ One life, I'm gonna live it up ♪
♪ I'm takin' flight I said, I'll never get enough ♪
♪ Stand tall, I'm young and kinda proud… ♪
[Jack] This is the company my friends and I started 23 years ago.
We make high-end throwback jerseys.
But I got talked into selling the company
so I could afford to send my son to private school,
where all the kids are dressed like fucking news anchors.
Goes against everything I believe in, but I'd do anything for my kid.
Dude, what are you doing?
You look like you just ran over a dog. Come on.
It's a great fucking day for us.
Is it?
We're about to become employees of our own company.
Jack, selling a business and the owner staying on
is older than discovering a country that already has people.
There you go.
Not to mention, the time to complain was before we signed the deal.
-I did complain about it. -Yeah, but you complain about everything.
[Jack] Oh, I do not.
Relax. It's gonna be great.
Well, that's easy for you to say. You're home free.
Yeah, that's true. You got no more child support.
-You got college taken care of. -Yeah.
What are gonna do now? Airbnb your kids' rooms, you cheap prick?
-[Jack laughs] -[sarcastic laughter] Laugh now, motherfuckers, but wait till you see what I got coming next.
Yeah, we'll see. We'll see.
What's up, party people?
-[Jack] Morning, everyone! -[woman] Morning, guys.
[woman 2] Morning.
Monica, what's poppin', girl?
Good morning, Connor.
Yo, you happen to check that new joint from Lil Baby
dropped on Twitter last night?
-[Monica] No. -What? Boom. Come on. Pound it out.
Ah, it's okay. Thanks.
-Oh God. -[Mike] There he goes again.
Don't sleep on Lil Baby, on any of the babies.
I heard Big Baby got something coming out too. It's gonna be fire.
Big Baby?
[Connor] Yeah, you… you peep him yet?
I don't believe I have, no.
What? He's fleek.
-Oh. -Yeah, he's on fleek. Flickity-fleek.
-[chuckles] -[Mike] Connor, come on.
-Aight. Gotta bounce. -[Monica] Okay.
-One love. One love, girl. -Okay. Okay. [Connor] One love, y'all.
You know, she's never gonna think you're cool.
I am cool, Jack. I'm sorry that you feel threatened by that.
Oh, I think everybody's threatened by it.
All right, you two, lock it down. We gotta impress this dude.
Wait. By "this dude," you mean the douchebag half our age we now work for?
I don't know, Jack. If I were you, I'd give him a chance.
I hear Aspen has a real collaborative leadership style.
That guy? He looks like he's in a musical about janitors.
[Mike] Play nice, Jack. The new owners love him.
And if we wanna get paid, we gotta keep our jobs.
Gentlemen. What an honor.
Aspen Bell.
-Mike. -Uh-huh.
-Hey! Connor. -Oh! I'm gonna get some of that? Ah!
-Jack. Good. -Hey, how are you? That's all right.
Okay. Uh, guys. Yeah, have a seat. Get comfortable.
Wow! The trifecta behind Trifecta.
This is some broad shoulders to stand on, boys.
Let's get right to it. Look, this is your company, right?
You built it.
And I want you to know that I respect the shit out of what you've done here.
I mean, come on, throwback jerseys?
You didn't just start the trend. You perfected it.
The breathability of this fabric.
Must have been sewn by the gods.
Actually, it was sewn together by some hardworking women in Koreatown.
But, uh, thank you. We're, uh, very proud of it.
And you should be.
You should be very proud of everything that you've done here.
And I want you to know that my door will always be open to you.
But I'm gonna break some eggs because I'm a disruptor.
It's in my DNA.
What does that mean?
It means that we're gonna pivot.
This company is now a gender-neutral, carbon-neutral, 21st-century lifestyle apparel brand.
21st-century lifestyle apparel brand.
And the first step in that is to liberate everyone born before 1988.
[woman] For what? All of us?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck? That's, like, half the company.
-[Mike] Calm down, man. -[Jack] You calm down.
-[man] Let's go. -Damien's 35? Goddamn, he looks good.
Hey, what happened to two weeks' notice? You can't just kick 'em out.
Don't touch me.
These people put their hearts and souls into this business.
And we signed them up for Zip Recruiter. They're gonna have a new job in no time.
Look, we are living in an exponential era.
Hmm. Jack, change and growth, these things happen faster than they did
when you were young.
I mean, look at me.
I'm 28 years old, and I've already worked for 15 different start-ups.
-Is that something you wanna brag about? -[Aspen] Absolutely.
Success does not care about the way that you feel.
I want people to come in here with a smile on their face,
but I need them to have Kevlar in their souls.
If that's too much to ask,
then I don't care how long you've been here.
You're gonna be out the door.
Is that a threat?
No, no. It's just transparent leadership.
Look, I care about you.
In fact, there is this woman I would love for you to go see.
She's an old friend of my mom. She has had a lot of success
helping people in your situation to restrain their aggressive tendencies.
You want me to go see a shrink?
I appreciate you.
"I appreciate you." "I appreciate you."
Fucking sociopath hipster douche.
Gonna threaten me in my own goddamn building?
I'll fucking knock you out, throw you in a bag of laundry,
and they'll never fucking see you again.
-Oh my God! -[car horn honks]
Come on! I'm gonna be late.
Just fucking sitting there.
Oh, look at this fucking asshole.
Fucking 30-year-old man riding a kids' toy right in the middle of the fucking street!
-[car horn honks] -Get over!
What's he doing now? Is he freestyling? Is he making a YouTube video?
Oh my God! How fucking self-involved are you?
Share the road!
Hey, I agree!
So, why don't you get up onto the fucking sidewalk where you belong?
Oh, is that for me? Oh, you a tough guy now, huh? Huh?
Where you going, you little cocksucker, huh?
What?
When was the last time you saw one of those bastards stop at a stop sign?
Then they get hit and frost the thing like some unforeseen tragedy happened.
Am I wrong?
Yes.
Toxic.
[Jack] Oh, look at this. Of course.
Unbelievable.
500 people come here every day, and they got 20 fucking spots.
How much money do you have to pay to get a parking lot?
What does that say?
I'm not reading all that fucking shit.
Eh, fuck it. Be in and out.
So, you are reading to your kids every night?
[woman] Uh, we do 17--
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me, sir?
Yeah?
-You were late for pickup. -I'm sorry. There was no parking spots.
-Daddy! Daddy! -Nate! Hey, little buddy.
Ah! What's up? What's up?
-I've missed you, man. -Me too.
-How was school? -[Nate] Good.
-You were late for pickup. -Yeah, I told you I couldn't find a spot.
I'm sorry. We don't accept excuses.
Wasn't an excuse. Just what happened.
Plus, I was only, like, two minutes late, right, buddy?
-Have you read the school guidebook? -Yep.
What?
It's a dollar for every minute you're late.
Of course it is.
Okay.
-Here's five bucks. It's all I got. -Oh, no. The first violation is free.
Really? Well, why didn't you tell me that before I put my kid down?
Well, if you'd actually read the guidebook instead of just saying you did,
I wouldn't have to tell you anything.
-Is there, like, a problem here, miss? -Well, actually--
If you have some issue with me,
you take me aside in private, and you talk to me.
You don't dress me down in front of my kid.
I'm paying you to educate my son, not me, okay?
Oh. Well, we here at Little Hearts and Minds believe that education extends into the home.
Oh, do you? Fantastic. And once again, you'd know that if you'd picked up the guidebook and--
And once again, you'd know that if you'd picked up the guidebook and--
Jesus Christ! I read the goddamn fucking guidebook!
All right, you stumpy little cunt?
Wow!
Oh my God.
Let's go, Nate.
[Nate] Daddy, what's a cunt?
[Jack] Somebody that gives you shit for being two seconds late for pickup.
How you doing?
Okay, buddy, we're home. Now what are we gonna do?
[Nate] Forget what happened and finish my ice cream.
[Jack] That's right.
Hey, buddy, was that good?
Ah, you're the best. Here. Let's get you cleaned up real quick. Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh. Doop-doop-doop-doop-doop.
Yep, okay, cool.
All right. Nothing but happiness when we go in there, okay? Awesome.
Mommy!
Well, hey! How are you, buddy?
-Hey, how was your meeting, honey? -Oh, it was good! How was pickup?
[Jack] Oh, it was great, smooth, uneventful.
Hey, you wanna go watch Puppy Dog Pals?
-Puppy Dog Pals! -Puppy Dog Pals. Yay!
[Leah clears throat] Jack. Uneventful? I just got off the phone with Doctor Lois Shmieckel-Turner.
Oh boy.
What is uneventful about calling Nate's principal a stumpy "C"?
If you saw the way she was talking to me, it was a perfectly normal response.
-For who? -Anyone with a shred of dignity.
[whispers] Keep it down.
[whispers] Anyone with a shred of dignity.
Okay, she was talking to me like some deadbeat dad
for showing up a minute and a half late for pickup.
Oh my God! This has nothing to do with your dignity.
This has everything to do with our son's academic future.
Do you know how powerful Doctor Lois Shmieckel-Turner is?
Her kindergarten recommendation
makes or breaks whether he gets into The Meadows.
Great. So we'll send him to a different private school.
She writes the recommendation no matter where he goes.
Great! Then it's public school. That place wasn't that bad, and it's free.
Are you kidding me? That place was that bad. -You admitted that-- -Sh.
[whispers] That one was that bad. And you said it was that bad. Okay?
We have been over this. We've looked at all the data.
Oh, Jesus Christ with the fucking data! Your generation and the data.
-What? -The data, the data, the data.
Here's some data for you, okay?
Not having your every need catered to is actually a good thing.
I went to public school. I turned out fine. Where you learned to talk to principals?
No, it's where I learned to stick up for myself.
You need to fix this. And you need to talk to someone about your anger.
Oh, Jesus Christ with the fucking therapy. Here we go.
-Great. Fine. Fine! -Always with the therapy.
Go ahead, white-knuckle it through this world.
But tomorrow, you're gonna go into that school,
and you are going to apologize.
Good, fine. You think I'm afraid of that? I'll go down there right now.
Great. She's not the first person I ever called that word.
Don't worry. I'll smooth it right over.
Jack, Leah. Thanks so much for coming.
Thank you so much for meeting with us, honestly.
Yes. Doctor Shmieckel-Turner, I… I just wanted to--
Uh, please, call me Doctor L.
-Doctor L, I just wanna say-- -No, no. Save those thoughts.
-[Jack] Oh, okay. -[Lois] Uh…
Oh, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa.
We're gonna do this in front of the whole school? -[chuckles nervously] -Um…
We view this more as a village than a school.
And we firmly believe in the practice of restorative justice, or gacaca.
A common practice in Rwanda which was especially effective
in the aftermath of their genocide.
And please, join the other parents.
Oh. Okay.
Okay. Wow! [chuckles]
That's quite a turnout.
Um… All right, um…
I guess, uh, looking back, I, uh, let my emotions get the best of me yesterday,
and, um, I wish I could have chosen my words a little bit differently.
All right?
And I am sorry that six of you heard this and then told the other 40.
And, uh, to any of the children that heard what I said,
it's never okay to say those words, okay?
I… I was very, very wrong. All right?
So that's it. Have a nice morning and, uh, keep using those paper straws.
I know they get soggy, but they're good for the turtles, evidently.
-Thank you. -Okay. No, no. Jack. Jack. Jack.
Yeah. We… we appreciate the words,
but the process of healing has only just begun.
-Yes, Judy. -[Judy] Yes, thank you.
Um, I would just like to voice how incredibly hurt I am.
Mr. Kelly, do you understand that using the C-word
is like the N-word but for women?
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, I'm… I'm sure… I'm sure it is.
You know, other than the 400 years of slavery and continued systemic oppression.
Other than that, I think you're making a really solid point.
Yes, Mimi.
Even though I wasn't there,
just knowing that language like that was used in front of the child--
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Please. Brian.
As a parent of a child and someone with chronically low metabolism,
but loving my body…
-Oh. Good for you, Brian. -Yeah.
…your use of the word "stumpy" was a real trigger to me and my whole family.
Seriously?
Yes.
Any type of body-shaming just reminds me
of what it feels like to be told that my body ain't good enough.
[Jack] Oh, okay. All right. Well, I understand that, and I'm sorry I made you feel that way.
And I'd also like to add, and I think a lot of you would agree,
we do have a major weight problem in this country. Do we not, you know?
And it doesn't just affect this man and his child.
I mean, the burden that out-of-shape people put on our healthcare system,
not to mention the loved ones they leave behind is…
it's truly, truly heartbreaking.
And I… I think, as a community, we should be able to talk about it.
Like maybe put a salad bar at drop-off or something like that.
Oh man! I would love that.
All right. Maybe… maybe not now.
Wrap it up. Thank you.
Uh, I'd just like to say that I am truly sorry for my actions yesterday.
They have no place in this community. Okay? All right.
I'm sorry. Have a nice morning. Good day.
Okay. Okay, let's all thank Jack.
It's not easy to admit when we are wrong.
This is going to be a long… a long journey.
But I know we will all be there to support him.
What the fuck? What does she mean by "long journey"?
The journey's over. I just apologized to her
and a bunch of weak-kneed people who weren't even there.
She doesn't write Nate's recommendation for another three months.
-So? -So!
You have a long time to prove to her that you are a good dad.
But why do I need to do that?
Because this recommendation is as much about Nate as it is about us as parents.
Oh, Jesus Christ! Is it ever over with these people?
I mean, how many fucking hoops do you have to jump through?
I don't know, Jack, but you created this problem.
So, are you going to man up and solve it, or am I registering for two pacifiers?
-Well? -All right.
I will play nice, and I will jump through all the hoops, okay?
Mm-hmm. Thank you. Have a good day.
Hi, baby. I grilled up some buffalo steaks,
and there's a Manhattan waiting for you on the table.
-Goddamn, baby. You look good. -[chuckles]
[Britney] Follow me.
[Mike] Just what I needed tonight.
Well, I do know how to take care of my man.
-[Mike chuckles] -Go on. Sit down.
Have a drink. Get all nice and relaxed.
Why? What happened?
Nothing.
Okay, well, I do have to tell you something, but you have to promise to not get mad.
I went to too many years of law school to agree to something like that.
What's going on?
Well,
I'm late.
There's no way. That's impossible.
I couldn't believe it either.
I had a vasectomy, and I pull out.
I… I know. I don't know how it happened, but…
maybe there's a reason.
Pee again.
-What? -Pee again!
I did. Three times.
Well, it's not mine, so go take a test.
I mean, look at it this way. You got really strong sperm.
You should be proud.
Seriously. I mean, guys our age, our cum is usually, like, asthmatic, you know,
but your shit's, like, Bruce Willis in Unbreakable, bro.
Yeah. To plow through a vasectomy with pre-cum.
-I mean, that's unheard of. -Come on.
That's like some Braveheart-level jizz.
Yeah, dude. You're like a Black William Wallace.
[shouts] Pre-cum!
Sorry.
Mike, this is gonna be great, okay? And remember, kids keep you young.
No, they don't. My kids almost killed me.
[Jack] Oh, come on.
Don't you remember the beauty of becoming a dad?
The smell of a newborn baby's head. I mean, it's the best.
They're funny, Mike. They're funny.
They say funny shit. They think farts are funny.
In the morning, he comes running in. "Pull my finger. Pull my finger."
-Wet one. It's funny. -[laughs]
It's adorable.
Another thing, you come home, they're excited to see you.
How many places do you walk in, and people just freak out
and start running at you, screaming your name?
You come home, you feel like you're famous.
Yeah, exactly. They don't die after 12 years. -Exactly. -Like a dog. Hopefully.
Mike, this is gonna be great. We all get to do it together.
Yeah.
Jack, you've aged ten years since Nate was born.
Connor, I don't know what's up with you 'cause you don't fucking age.
-Thanks, buddy. -[Mike] It's not a compliment.
I don't know what kind of Botox shit you're on,
but it's gonna kill you.
All right, dude. Ease up. Okay? I didn't fucking get you pregnant.
Just… If you don't want the baby, just get an abortion.
Flush it.
[scoffs] I don't believe in that. That's some white shit.
-What's that mean? -What?
I don't know. I'm emotional.
She said she didn't wanna have kids.
What the fuck am I gonna do?
-I'm having a heart attack. -You're not.
-Can we get some water? Just breathe. -I'm gonna have a heart attack.
You're not gonna have a heart attack. You go to the gym.
Nobody has a heart attack that goes to the gym.
Except… Remember that jogging guy? He died of a heart attack.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah. -Remember that guy?
[Lois] Good morning, everyone. Morning, Doctor L.
-Oh! -[Jack] Hey, buddy. [kisses] I'll see ya. Have fun. Okay?
Is that for me?
Oh, it's for the whole community. Yeah, it's an olive tree.
Very drought-friendly. And an eternal symbol of peace.
I thought it'd be a nice way to cultivate the kids', uh, social-emotional growth.
Something we work on a lot with Nate at home, you know?
Well, I… I am impressed.
But this tree is incompatible with our ecosystem.
The insects that it would attract
would be detrimental to all plant life here.
-This is a funny moment. -[Jack laughs] Yeah. You and I are having a--
[laughs] What?
I find it so apropos that you have brought the plant version of yourself.
Jack, I appreciate the effort. I know how hard this is for you.
But fortunately, I am here to guide you.
If you're willing to take my advice. Is that something you'd be open to?
-I need a verbal confirmation. -Yes.
Walk with me.
As you can see, this is such a dynamic and whimsical place.
A launching pad for the next generation of great leaders.
Such as Nate.
But they'll never reach the stratosphere without enough fuel.
Our annual fundraiser is coming up,
and given your leadership experience in sales,
I think you might make a great chairman.
-[laughs] Me? -What do you think?
I think I'm beginning to see how this school works.
♪ Come on, baby Let me see you with the lights up… ♪
Let's go. You're fucking getting to ten.
-Let's go! -Ah! I got it.
-Are you a pussy? -No.
-Are you a pussy? -You're a pussy.
You're a fucking pussy. Come on, let's go. Let's go.
Come on. What are you, on your period? Let's go. Look at me. Look at me.
-Look at me! -Ah, I'm looking.
That's it. Let's go. One more. One more. One more.
-Come on! That's all you! That's all you! -[straining] Fuck!
All right. Let's go. Down. Down.
Up high. Twice. Ah! Fuck Pilates!
-Whoo! -That was a good set.
-So, you gonna help me with this thing? -[straining] Fuck, no.
-Come on. It's just a fundraiser meeting. -I said no.
What about that time I pretended to be your dad 'cause you were lying to that chick about your age, huh?
I have no recollection of that incident. Oh, you don't? You don't? Isn't that convenient?
Hey, there's Mike.
-[Jack] That Britney's car? -[Connor] I don't think so.
Look at the plates. Someone went crazy on CarMax.
You know what? I give you two-to-one
there's no more baby, and there's no more Britney.
-No. You think so? -Yeah. Fifty bucks.
Fifty? Hundred.
-Hundred. C-note? -C-note?
-C-note! -C-note!
-All right. Be cool. -All right.
-[Jack] Hey! -Yo, yo, yo.
-Look who's here. Big Mike! -What's cracking?
-[Jack] Man, how are you? -[Connor] What's up, baby?
-You look good. -You get a new car?
[scoffs] Ford Fusion SEL, fully loaded. Heated seats, Bluetooth, dual sunroof.
Delivered straight to my door. You wanna take it for a spin?
Me? Nah, I'm good. I'll just rent one the next time I go to Tampa.
Hey, so, you and Britney still having the kid, right?
Yeah, why wouldn't we be?
I don't know. Everything you're doing is suggesting you took a mulligan.
Why can't I be raising the kid and have the car of my dreams?
And pick up a Boyz II Men pinball machine on eBay.
People say it's impossible.
Well, fuck those people because I'm doing it. Huh?
All right.
-Fuck. -[Mike] Let's get it in, fellas.
All right. Pay up, or go to the meeting.
Motherfucker.
Okay, I can get the VFW to give us the space for free.
My buddy Mitch has a wholesale liquor company.
We get the booze at cost, and that just leaves the entertainment and the auction.
Uh, but what's the theme?
What's the theme? You know, everybody takes an Uber.
We all get ripped. Take a night off from our kids.
You know what? I think she's right. I think we need a theme.
-Yeah. -[woman 1] We definitely need a theme.
Last year's theme was the Puerto Rican Day Parade.
-[woman 2] That was great. -We had Tito Puente Jr.
How about an '80s-themed party?
[Connor] Now there's an idea.
-I fucking love the '80s. -Fucking '80s are the best.
Tank tops, T-tops, and blow, baby.
Finger-banging for days. Miami Vice!
That's what started that whole thing, sport coats with the T-shirt underneath.
Yeah. No socks. Remember? You fold over the pant, roll it up.
-No… Yeah. -Boom. Hummer.
Are we reliving your childhood or planning a party?
I'm always down for a party. -I am too. -[Connor] Right?
How about "We Are the World"? That's an interesting song. Right?
And, you know, it's inclusive.
Deals with Africa. We got a lot of Black kids in the school.
Uh-- Wha-- I… I mean, I guess it is kind of inclusive.
Inclusive adjacent, but some of us weren't even born in the '80s.
So I just think that, like, why would we be looking backwards?
You know? Like, our whole vibe here at this school and this whole community
is… is looking forward, and I just don't think it really lines up.
I've got it. What about the United States of Gender?
-There it is. Oh my God. I love that! -I know. I love it.
We could have an entirely trans waitstaff. It'd be great!
Okay. Wait, guys. There's gonna be a lot of different people here at this party.
Maybe we should try to keep it a little more mainstream.
Hmm. Define mainstream.
I don't know, like, you know, not turn it into, like, a tranny bar.
-Oh my God! -Tranny? You cannot say that word!
-What are you supposed to say? -[clears throat]
[all] Trans!
Oh, all right. Well, I was close. Trans, tranny. It's like Mike, Mikey.
Mikey!
Yeah. [laughs] I mean, people call me a ginger. I don't give a fuck.
I didn't mean anything by it. All right. Trans.
I think if we could just peer through the fog of Jack's antiquated logic,
we'll all realize that Jack's trying to bring us together, okay?
He's trying to move us forward, not polarize us, okay?
Can I just… Can I just…
Is there a reason we always have
two white men dominating the discussion in this room?
Was that directed at us?
'Cause if I'm not mistaken, you're also a white male, buddy.
Why don't you consult the results of my 23andMe test?
Because the 3% of my lineage that is Sri Lankan
is really not appreciating your tone in this moment.
So I'm gonna need you to check your privilege.
-Check my privilege? -That's right. Check your privilege.
Okay. Uh, why don't we concentrate on the silent auction?
That's not a white guy?
I'm confused.
Oh my God! Look at this place. It just gets more depressing every day.
What up, party people?
Ah! What up, fam?
Yo, y'all check out that TikTok video of the couple exchanging clothes?
What?
Uh, no, I'm not actually on TikTok, man.
What? What are you on an Android phone?
-Yeah. As a matter of fact, I am. -Yeah. Me too.
It's open-source software. Fully customizable.
-Yes! Yes! -Right? That's what I'm talking about.
Fuck.
Yo. Did you feel that earthquake this morning? You feel that?
Don't worry.
It's just my thoughts.
Fame.
It was once only the provenance of the talented.
But now we are living in an era
in which everyone believes that they deserve to be famous.
The fame bubble is big, my friends. And it's about to burst.
You can already see the cracks.
Celebrities announcing they're taking a break from social media
by taking a selfie and posting it to social media. It's insane.
And we are going to make an insane amount of money
by making not wanting fame the new fame.
We're gonna find a brand ambassador.
Someone who earnestly does not crave fame.
Introducing Ed Cameron.
He is the LeBron James of not being famous.
Lives on a plot of alopeciad land in New Mexico.
He is entirely self-sustaining.
And as far as we know, he's had little to no human contact,
not since the late 1980s.
How did you find him?
Well, it wasn't easy. But in 1976, he signed up for a raffle at a local church.
That information was sold to Mammoth Mart,
who then sold it to Columbia Record and Tape Club,
who turned right around and sold it to JPMorgan Chase.
And then they got hacked, and it ended up on the dark web,
so that was a little harder to--
It's not that important to talk about how we acquired his personal information.
Doesn't matter.
[Aspen] What matters is how we're gonna bring him in.
And I got three words for ya. Jack, Mike, Connor, the founding fathers.
Whoa, whoa! What?
You want all three of us to go pitch this guy?
Yeah. Yeah, with my boy, Trav. [tongue clicks]
Why is Travis coming?
Good question, Connor. I appreciate you.
Hey, hey. This guy chose to live in the middle of nowhere.
[Mike] Yeah.
So, how the hell are we gonna convince him to become famous?
Therein lies the work, Jack.
Do you think that Steve Jobs invented things?
-Yeah. Quite a bit, actually. -Yeah.
-iPad. -[Aspen] No.
He said things, and then other people did them.
So I've said things today,
and I want you to go and do those things.
[Mike] Jack, what do you think we're walkin' into here?
I mean, you think this guy is even gonna be able to speak English?
[Connor] Yeah. When did he go off the grid?
Like, 1988.
-Seriously? -Yeah.
He's probably still jerkin' off to Samantha Fox.
All right, serious question.
Would you rather fuck Samantha Fox in her prime,
but she's wearing a Barbara Bush mask?
Or fuck Barbara Bush, circa 1988,
but you get to have Samantha just lookin' at you,
full eye contact, and she's naked?
-Oh, wow! That's a good one. -[Connor] Thank you.
-[Jack] You always get the left turn. -[Connor] Mm-hmm.
I mean, I think I gotta go with the combo platter.
I mean, Samantha Fox is smokin' hot, but if I get both of them…
You know, I get to look at Samantha.
And Barbara Bush, I think she was a clean woman. -You know? -Yeah.
And I've never been that close to that level of power before.
Do it in the Oval Office,
you know, pick up the red phone, see who's on the other side.
The oval orifice.
-Yeah, dude! -See what I did there?
Bunch of guys, right? Just fuckin' hangin' out.
Trashin' women. Yeah, so cool. You guys are so dope.
What, are we offending you?
[Travis] No, man, you're not offending me.
I just think this misogynistic behavior amongst groups of men is a little, uh, little cliché.
Ah, Jesus Christ. We got a feminist in the car.
Look, I'm just looking out for you guys, okay?
No offense, you're just comin' across a little…
A little old, you know? A little out of touch.
We try evolving.
Evolving? It's a good idea. Like your generation, right?
Filmin' yourselves while you're flippin' over water bottles.
Incredible progress.
If I may interject.
Travis, it sounds like what you're saying is you feel your generation
is more evolved than our generation.
Oh my God, that was a real question? Yeah, absolutely. Yes.
Travis, do you like rap music?
I mean, yeah, I listen to all kinds of music.
You go deep, or you listen to that mumble rap shit?
No, I go deep.
Really? How deep?
You know, the greats. Wu-Tang, Biggie, Nas, uh, N.W.A.
N.W.A?
Okay, my man Travis goes way back.
Saw the movie. Bought the soundtrack.
You probably know who Yella Boy is.
Wow!
You like to sing along to them in the car?
Yeah, I rap to them sometimes. Yeah.
What do you do when they drop the N-word?
-[chuckles] -You keep singing along?
Uh, no, I… I… I…
I listen.
-You just listen? -[Travis] Yeah. I do. I… I listen.
I mean, what, do you got a pause button in your brain? This is N.W.A.
You're by yourself. Windows are up.
Cruisin' down the highway. You feelin' it!
Are you tellin' me that you stop your flow?
-I do. -Bullshit, motherfucker! Nobody could.
It's N.W.A.
-I thought you said you loved them. -I do.
-Do you love them? -Yes, I do!
-And you stop your flow? -No, I say it!
I wanna hear how he says it. Put on N.W.A "Straight Outta Compton."
Oh, come on, man. I don't wanna do this. I don't wanna do this.
Why not? You say it when I'm not around, but you won't say it when I am around.
That makes me feel like you're sayin' it in a way I wouldn't wanna hear it.
I just wanna go on record as saying I don't wanna do this.
[shouts] Sing the damn song!
Okay. Just chill out.
♪ Straight outta Compton Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube ♪
♪ From the… ♪
♪ When I'm called off, I get a sawed-off ♪
♪ Pull the trigger And the bodies get hauled off ♪

N-- No.
Fuck! I don't wanna say it, man. I don't wanna say it.
Good. You shouldn't wanna say it.
But on behalf of Dr. Dre and company, thank you for buying this shit.
Hey, Mike, for the record, whenever I listen to hip-hop, I never say it, bro.
Really? When do you say it?
[Connor] Uh… -Okay, guys. Come on. It's over. -Jack! Jack!
-[Connor] Oh shit. -[Jack] Shit.
-[Travis] Shit, Jack. -The fuck was that?
[Mike] I don't know, but it's dead.
-[Western movie music plays] -[Travis] What's that guy doin'?
Holy shit. I think that's him.
[Connor] Who?
-Ed Cameron. -[Travis] Nuh-uh.
-You fucking kidding me? -No.
[Mike] Where you goin'? Get back in the car.
[Jack] Hi.
How you doing?
Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry. Was that your armadillo?
It is now.
-The highway provides. -Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
This, uh, might seem like a weird question,
but you wouldn't happen to be Ed Cameron, are you?
Who's askin'?
Oh. Jack Kelly.
Uh, we were just coming up here to talk to you.
You ain't a bunch of fags, are you?
Hey, Cara.
-Yeah. -[Leah] Hey.
-Sorry. -I'll catch you later. -Bye, Joanna. -Sweetie, let's go.
I was hoping I was gonna run into you today.
How's the second trimester?
You know? It's harder than it was with Nate.
You know what? I could tell. You're looking a little peaked.
-You still working out? -[laughing uncomfortably]
Yeah.
Uh, I was gonna talk to you about Britney's baby shower.
-[Colin roaring] -And I was thinking we should-- Oh!
Hey, Colin. You have to be careful, okay? Auntie Leah's got a baby in here.
Hi, baby!
Colin! You are not allowed to do that, do you understand me?
Hey, hey! He's got a little extra energy.
That doesn't give you the right to scream at my child.
I was just trying to protect myself.
He's five years old. He doesn't know any better. Don't you think he should?
Are you calling me a bad mother?
You could say I think your parenting techniques are interesting.
Home birth, no epidural, 4% body fat.
The proof is in the pudding.
Maybe if you occasionally ate some of that pudding, you wouldn't have sweat your tits off.
-Yeah. -[gasps]
I cannot wait to see the look on Aspen's face
when he congratulates us for landing that fucking lunatic.
Fucker's gonna give us all bedbugs.
-Hey, Travis. -Yo.
Holy shit. They already got him on a T-shirt?
Yeah. It's the prototype, but it's pretty fucking sick, right?
So, last night, Aspen goes to this ayahuasca ceremony,
and he gets this, like, crazy vision.
Memes, T-shirts, NFTs.
I don't know what any of that means.
I mean, dude's a crazy fucking genius. This campaign is gonna be fire.
If you say so.
Hey, sorry I'm late.
Hey, Connor. You see they already got this guy on a T-shirt?
Unbelievable.
-What are you doin' way over there? -I can sit wherever I want.
-There a reason you're not looking at me? -I don't know. Is there?
[Aspen] Gentlemen.
You did it. You guys crushed it. You really did.
I mean, I understand now why this company has been alive for 23 years.
Yeah, well, guess these old dogs had a little more bite left in 'em
than you thought.
Yeah.
We're gonna have to talk about the rental car though.
Ah, just a scratched bumper. We have insurance.
We have insurance for the car. We don't have insurance for this.
Hey, let me ask you a question. Did Caitlyn Jenner keep Bruce's dick?
-[Mike] Like in a jar? -Where'd you get this?
[Jack] No, like, she still has it.
Like, Caitlyn has tits and a dick, and is that why you say "they"?
-[Mike] I get what you're saying. -Look, I'm not saying I'd bang Caitlyn.
But, I mean, tell me that's not a better person to watch a game with. That's fucking Bruce Jenner.
I wonder, like, every four years when the Summer Olympics come up,
who's the first one to call Caitlyn and be like,
-"You wanna watch the decathlon today?" -Yeah. [laughs]
[Travis] I feel super fucking bad for all your wives.
Let me ask you something, Travis. You ever been married?
-No, I haven't. -Well, there you go.
Why don't you go up to a Marine now and tell him what it's like in battle?
Did you set that camera up? You fucking snitch. Whoa. No, no, no, no, no, no.
Whoa. No, no, no, no, no, no.
Trav had nothing to do with this, okay? This came from the rental car company.
They sent it to us in exchange for all of our users' personal information.
Are you fucking kidding me?
[Aspen] It's an information economy.
They, uh, record everything for liability and safety, apparently.
Well, you know, once I saw it… Guys, my hands are tied.
Gonna have to liberate you.
"Liberate" us? Is he firing us over that bullshit?
It's a bunch of guys shootin' the shit in a car.
There's no way that's fucking legal.
It is, actually, in New Mexico.
Okay, fine, so we're terminated. You still gotta pay us.
Actually, we don't.
Because your behavior violated the terms of your morality clause in your contract.
Morality clause?
What… what's he talkin' about?
So all of your equity has been liquidated,
and it's been returned to the general fund.
What the fuck?
[Aspen] You have to leave the premises immediately if you don't mind.
-Let's go. -Look. The meter maids are back, huh?
You hide behind these guys? Do all your dirty work?
Yeah, they're good guys.
Un-fuckin'-believable.
120 pounds soakin' wet. -You fucking piece of shit. -[exhales] Wow!
-[Aspen] Come on. -Real nice, man.
-Travis, can you get that? -Yeah.
Yikes, right? [laughs]
You too, though, Travis. You too.
What?
I didn't condone anything that was goin' on in the car.
I was being vocally--
♪ And shit ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah… ♪
-Is that my apartment? -Yeah.
Why… why do you have this, Aspen?
[Aspen] You got a TV with a camera. Things could happen.
♪ Gold all in my chain ♪
♪ Gold all in my ring ♪
♪ Gold all in my watch ♪
♪ Don't believe me, just watch Nigga, nigga, nigga ♪
♪ Don't believe me, just watch ♪
♪ Don't believe me, just watch Nigga, nigga, nigga… ♪
-Justin. -Come on, man!
Oh, Aspen, come on, man. I was getting hyped, dude.
I was… I was gettin' ready to start my fuckin' day.
I was gettin' ready to start the day, dude!
What the hell's a morality clause?
It's a boilerplate clause in every corporate contract,
but I've never heard it used in the context
of secretly filming someone in a rental car in a different state.
Well, why the fuck would you have us three knuckleheads
sign a morality clause when you know how we are?
Don't you mean how you are? Motherfucker, let me tell you somethin'.
If it wasn't this, it'd be somethin' else. And now, thanks to you,
I'm gonna be working until I'm 85!
Oh, you're not puttin' this on me, Mike. You're not puttin' this on me, okay?
For 23 years, you didn't miss a goddamn thing,
but you were so hot to trot to get your loaded Ford fucking Fusion,
you left us exposed.
Are you questioning my competency?
No, I'm questioning your motivation.
Guys, come on, okay? We're all in this together.
[Mike] Not anymore. I'm done with you, Jack. You and your big fuckin' mouth.
Come on, Mike.
-[Connor sighs] -Connor, why aren't you lookin' at me?
Don't worry about it, okay? I can look wherever I want.
-The fuck is goin' on with you? -Jack, we can't hang out right now, okay?
Just know that there will come a time in the future when we will be able to hang out again, but that time is not now, okay?
when we will be able to hang out again, but that time is not now, okay? -It's just… It's too fuckin' weird. -[melancholy music playing]
The fuck are you talkin' about?
Why don't you ask your wife?
-[door opens] -[melancholy music continues] [Leah] Hey, babe.
-[door closes] -Did you try to fuck Connor?
-Huh? -What? What are you talking about?
How come Connor said you're the reason me and him can't hang out?
-I don't-- -Answer me that, Leah. Answer me that.
Oh my God.
Okay. So, Cara and I got into an argument at pickup, okay?
I said she was a shitty mom who couldn't parent her kid.
-Well, didn't I tell you not to do that? -Yes, yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, but…
Do you really think that I would try and fuck Connor?
-No, that was stupid. -I mean… Come on, what are you--
-I'm emotional. -What's going on?
I lost my job today.
-What? -I lost my job today.
-What? -We all did.
Oh no, honey. Oh no. What happened?
I don't know. I…
We said some shit on that road trip, and it got back to the office.
What did you say?
You know, stuff you say in a rental car when you don't know you're bein' filmed.
Can I guess?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't.
It wasn't that bad.
Look, the real point is, you know, I let you and the kids down,
and now Nate can't go to private school.
I feel terrible about that. I'm gonna figure out a way--
No. You know what? Nate is gonna go to private school.
And I don't care if we have four mortgages on the house and I work every day
until my water breaks, but my son is not gonna get left behind
because his father has the self-control of a two-year-old.
It's not self-control. It's a right-to-privacy issue, but…
[Connor] Dear Jack, these last months have felt like a fuckin' eternity, man.
I miss you.
I miss our brotherhood.
The fighting for a common goal, the camaraderie, the ball-breaking,
even though it was often at my expense.
[announcer] Jenner into the spin. Lets it fly.
Bruce Jenner has won gold!
You don't have to know what's going on to be what's going on.
-[female voice] The Ed Cameron Collection. -[hawk squawking]
-[sentimental music playing] -[Connor] Mike is hanging in there.
You know, he's got a good job at a mid-level firm, and I think he's really comin' around to becoming a father again.
and I think he's really comin' around to becoming a father again.
And he seems happy, but… Well, you know Mike.
He's not a big talker.
Being unemployed hasn't been easy.
But I've been watching this guy Joel Osteen a lot.
Man, once you get past all the God shit, the guy's got a pretty positive message.
And his hair is bangin'.
He told the story of these three sheepherders--
[sighs] Fuck.
Dear Jack,
I miss you, man.
As you know, I was a neglected child.
Lot of time with the Legos, if you know what I mean, and-- -[door creaks] -[eerie music plays]
What are you doing?
Nothing. It's just…
Just knockin' off a little haiku. It's…
It's stupid. I…
Let's go to bed, right, babe?
I'm so tired.
[bartender] Here you are.
-Thank you. -Thank you.
-[woman] Jack! -Hey.
I mean, great party. Everybody seems to be having a blast.
-Oh, thank you. -[man] I have to commend you.
Having the foresight to see that any party theme decided upon
by a predominantly white committee would be inherently biased…
Well, your growth really makes my heart smile.
Oh, well, I was just listenin' to the group.
Hey, who knew throwin' a party celebratin' white people not hurtin' anyone
would actually be a big hit?
I'm a little surprised too. Congratulations, Jack.
Oh, thank you, Doctor L.
But remember, the real metric for the party is what it does for the children.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Godspeed.
Hey, hey. You know what? Don't worry about her.
Yeah, you're right. This next item is gonna sell itself.
If it doesn't, we can always auction off some of our dumb jewelry.
Listen, you just need to focus, okay?
-Right. Right. -Think about Nate.
You know, turn on that charm I so deeply regret falling in love with every day.
You're gonna bring it home, like you always do, right?
-Right. Right. All right. -Oh, uh, Connor gave me a note.
Actually, he gave someone else a note to give to me to give to you.
I don't know.
You're gonna be great. I know it.
-I love you. -Thank you. Thank you.
[Connor] Dear Jack, this situation sucks. But I'm here for you, bro.
I'd write more, but these gummies are starting to kick in.
-[Cara] What are you doing? -[pop music playing]
Doin' this, girl. Ah, remember that? The old days? What? Girls.
All right, ladies and gentlemen. Uh, just a little quick reminder.
There's only 45 minutes left in our silent auction.
That's still plenty of time to bid on some incredible items,
including artwork created by your own children
to raise money for the school.
It's not child labor if it's for a good cause. Am I right?
All right. Now, if we look at the Doctor L-O-Meter,
we are inching towards our goal of $30,000,
which brings us to the live auction.
The next item we have up for bids is something very special.
I know what you're thinking to yourself.
You're thinking, "Jack, how the heck are you gonna top two floor seats
to see Adele at The Forum?"
Well, ladies and gentlemen, you better have those paddles in your hands
'cause I'ma tell you something.
We are about ready to bid… Get ready for this.
We're about ready to bid on two hours of uninterrupted,
one-on-one time with the one and only
Doctor Lois Shmieckel-Turner!
-[crowd cheering] -Yes, there she is!
Two hours to glean an entire lifetime of parental knowledge
from one of Southern California's leading educators.
Now, this is crazy to me. They told me to start this bidding at $1,500.
But I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is.
Old Jackie boy is feeling a little bit crazy tonight.
I don't know, but since I'm having so much fun at this "no theme" theme event
that I'm gonna get a little crazy here, people.
I'm not starting the biddin' off at $1,500.
I'm gonna start it off at $2,000, huh?!
Yeah! So, who's gonna have fun with me, huh? All right.
Do I hear $2,100? Who's got 21? I got $2,100 right there.
$2,100. Do I hear 22? 22! Who's got 22?
Brian Dodson! Big Brian. Not body-shaming. You look fantastic.
My God! Ladies, look at this guy. I know he's married, but you know,
little side glance won't hurt you.
Do I hear 23? Who's got 23?
Joanna Wilkerson, who needs a nanny who's also a personal assistant,
if you can help out.
All right, 24. I need 24. Who's got 24? 24?
Brian Dodson! Back to Big Brian.
Oh my God! We've got a dogfight going on here.
And I'm jumping right in the middle of it.
I'm not going $2,500. I'm not going 26, 27, 28.
I'm taking the elevator up to the penthouse.
I'm going $3,000!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
$3,000, baby! Who's coming with me?
Who's going $3,200? Let me hear $3,200. 32.
Thirty-two. Great number. OJ Simpson. OJ Simpson scaring the white people.
All right. Marcus Allen. Who's going $3,200? Come on.
All right. Old Jack, you got a little too crazy. How about $3,100?
$3,100. Who's got $3,100, huh?
$3,100?
All right. Come on, people. I saw a lot of Teslas in the parking lot.
Just 'cause your car's quiet doesn't mean you have to be.
-$3,100. -[silence]
Really? You're gonna let me walk with this for $3,000?
'Cause I'll tell you right now. I'll take it. I will take it.
$3,000? $3,000 going once. $3,000 going twice.
$3,000? Final time!
-[silence] -Sold to Jack Kelly!
I'm gonna fucking kill myself.
Yeah! Jack Kelly!
All right. That concludes this portion of the auction.
We only have a few more items left to bid.
Please hold onto those paddles. We're gonna get to our goal, all right?
Have a good time. Keep drinking those drinks.
I'll be back in a few moments for the last few items.
All right. Enjoy yourselves.
[Lois] Jack.
I must thank you for your generous donation.
And I'm also quite frankly surprised you'd want to spend two hours with me.
Yeah. Well, I guess I'm full of surprises, huh?
[Lois] Yes. Yes, you are,
considering I heard that you lost your job and your company.
How are you and your family handling this setback?
Just fine.
Because we have tons of literature that will help you
through what I know must be a very trying time.
Hey, listen, Doctor L,
you can drop the act, okay? Just drop the act.
All right, you got my money.
So now I guess my kid gets a good recommendation,
and everything's fine.
Jack, I hope you aren't insinuating that your financial commitment
is going to buy your child a recommendation.
Oh, I would never do that. No.
You know, Jack, I don't fault you for the way you are.
You're just blinded by a lifetime of privilege.
If I was privileged, I don't think I'd have to spend two hours
pretending I wanted to talk to you, now would I?
Excuse me?
You heard me.
-[Lois] I guess I did. -[Jack] Good.
I will take that into consideration when I write up Nate's recommendation.
Oh, I bet you will. I bet you will, huh? That's how you operate?
Fuck over an innocent child 'cause you have petty bullshit with me?
Hey. You two already started talking. I, uh…
I hope that doesn't count against our two hours.
Hello, Mrs. Kelly.
Good night, Jack.
What did you say to her?
I didn't do anything. She came over here. She started twisting the knife, Leah.
What did you say to her?
Of course. Of course. What did I say?
What did Jack say? Can you ever be in my corner, Leah, huh?
I just dropped three grand that we don't have to spend two hours with that fucking egomaniac.
to spend two hours with that fucking egomaniac.
And you come over with, "What did Jack say?"
You know what I said? I said what everybody is already thinking
but doesn't have the fucking balls to say.
Oh, great. Great. Now you're gonna cry, right?
-Yeah. Great. -[sniffles]
You're an asshole.
Oh, I'm an asshole? Then why did I do all of this, huh?
What, you're mad? What? What, Leah? 'Cause I'm honest? Huh?
-Huh, Leah? -[door slams in distance]
What the fuck are you guys looking at, huh?
Yeah, I could be like you guys.
Pretending to care. You guys don't care.
All you're trying to do is not get in trouble.
That's what the fuck is wrong with your whole generation.
[woman] Okay, boomer.
Generation X!
[man] Slacker.
[Jack] Here you go.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Leah. Leah!
Leah, open the door.
Leah.
Leah, come on. Open the door.
I know you can hear me.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
I'll fix that.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
What the fuck's wrong with me? You locked me out.
I know I did. So, what are you doing standing here?
'Cause I live here.
Oh, Jack. I need you to not be in this house right now.
All right, fine, whatever. I'll sleep on the couch.
No. I have had it. I have had it with your outbursts.
I have had it with your… your inability to understand your level of anger
and the negative effect it's having on our family.
Okay, I'm sorry. I got a little sideways tonight. I just--
No. No. No.
You don't get to keep doing this over and over and over again, okay,
and just thinking that an apology makes it okay, because it doesn't, okay?
You fucking humiliated me tonight. And you humiliated your son.
And I am past arguing about it with you!
What… what are you saying?
I just need you to leave, Jack.
Because right now, I don't know if I even wanna raise my kids with you.
-Okay? -Oh, Jesus! Really?
-Yes! -You're gonna take it to that level?
Yes, I'm going to take it to that fucking level, Jack!
-Because of that bullshit down there! -Exactly!
[Jack] That I told you was gonna happen! I told you!
And I'm down there dancing like a fucking show pony!
Pack your bag!
-Oh, honey. I'm sorry. -Hey, buddy.
Oh. Come here. Did we wake you up?
Mommy, why is Daddy leaving?
Daddy's got a lot of work he's gotta do, buddy.
When are you gonna be done, Daddy?
Um, yeah, I… I don't know, buddy.
Hey. Let's get you back to bed, okay?
Okay.
Oh shit.
I said no onions.
[man] Oh, excuse me, sir.
You can't smoke out here.
Well, what are you doing?
Uh, I'm… I'm vaping.
What's the difference?
The difference is people can't smell what I'm doing from ten blocks away.
All right. Well, I can see what you're doing. It's called smoking.
So, till you put yours out, I'm not putting mine out. How about that?
I don't mean to pull rank here, but this is my hotel.
Motel.
-What? -It's a motel.
Open courtyard. A serial killer can walk right up to my door, man.
If this was a hotel, he'd have to go through a lobby first.
It's a motel. So, why don't you get off your high horse, huh?
Hey, quick question. Uh, what the fuck is your problem?
What's my problem? My problem is I live in a world
where a guy who's smoking is telling me I can't smoke, all right?
That, in a nutshell, is my problem.
Well, in a nutshell, it's not smoking.
What makes it smoking, buddy,
is the fucking smoke coming out of your mouth, all right?
So, get out of my fucking face before I throw you in that fucking pool?
I don't respond to hyperbole!
-Good. I don't know what that means. -If you want an ass-kicking, keep talking.
Oh! "Hyperbole"! I got big hotel words.
Ladies, ladies, whoa. What are we doing here?
It's a nice day. Relax. Take in the view.
Sweetheart, mind if I ask you a question?
Yeah, what's that?
Do you think vaping is smoking?
Oh, absolutely, yeah. And it's ruining this country.
Thank you. Thank you. There. I rest my case.
Yeah, and so are those fucking immigrants.
I mean, how many more can we let in? [laughs]
Well, that made some room.
[Britney] I'm excited for this baby shower.
Aren't you glad Leah suggested we do coed?
-We're gonna have fun, right? -Definitely.
Baby, look at me.
I know you're scared, okay? So am I.
But I can't live in fear anymore.
I need you to know what I need, or this isn't gonna work.
I want us to be official. And not just for the baby but for us.
I love you, Mike. And I want us to get married.
[echoing] And I know you may need some time to process this, and…
Okay.
Okay?
Yep.
Well, can you fucking hug me or something? Damn!
Where are you going?
[Mike] Nowhere. I'm just gonna go register to vote.
[Nate] Hi! You've reached my mom. She's not here.
-[Leah] Tell 'em to leave a message. -[Nate] Leave a message.
-[waitress] From pastrami with love. -Yeah.
[waitress] Fries extra crispy. Oreo cookie shake.
-And a root beer. -Thank you.
You sure you wanna do this?
There's nothing else to do.
-Oh God. I miss coke. -Where the fuck did you get that?
Don't worry about that, Jackie boy. I know a guy.
Don't worry about that, Jackie boy. I know a guy. [snorts] Now let's go set this neon town on fire!
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, huh?
Okay, all right. We're still in Pomona, so pace yourself.
You fucking pace yourself, okay? I got about 90 minutes
before my wife gets home and notices my sister watching the kids.
So, you know, this might be the coke talking, but I don't give a fuck.
-My man Mikey here is getting married. -[thud]
[snorts] What was that? It's just us in here, right?
Yeah, yeah. We're cool. Just relax, man. -It was a bump in the road. Just the road! -Whoa! Sh! Sh! Sh!
-It was a bump in the road. Just the road! -Whoa! Sh! Sh! Sh!

Don't look so surprised.
Britney and I are actually incredibly close.
It's not like that kind of thing where we have to talk every day to reinforce it.
Right. Uh, sure.
Um, listen, I'm really sorry that I criticized your parenting.
-That was a total overstep. -Hmm. So, uh, you know, can we just move on?
Oh, I did already. I assumed you had too.
I just did.
Well, come in, come in because Britney really needs us.

Oh, no, no, no, no. No. What are you doing? What are you doing?
It's okay. I'm due.
Mike, you've gambled, like, four times in your life, okay?
How the fuck are you due?
All right, Jack.
I'm a conservative man.
I drive a four-door sedan with seven airbags.
I got a vasectomy. Guess what?
She got pregnant anyway.
Then I lost my job, my company, my retirement,
all because I decided to exercise free speech
in the back of a goddamn rental car!
So, yeah, Jack. I think I'm fucking due!
Okay, okay. Sorry.
But look. Look around the casino, Mike. Everybody here thinks they're due.
Look at that poor lady. She looks like she's scuba diving.

Wait a second. Wait a second. Sensitivity training? What's that?
Did you guys know that Native Americans take offense to the term "spirit animal"?
Wait. Did you get in trouble for selling those Ed Cameron T-shirts?
Suspended indefinitely, actually.
-I think that's millennial for "fired." -[all laughing]
That's what happens to punk motherfuckers!
How ironic!
Yeah, how'd it feel to get fired for absolutely nothing?

All right, relax.
They fucking put my home address on Reddit.
And my girlfriend left me.
[Britney] Yeah, but you didn't see the look on his face.
I don't think he wants to be with me anymore.
Trust me. He does.
How do you know?
Because Connor has that look on his face all the time.
It means nothing. -It has to mean something. -This is what it means.
-It has to mean something. -This is what it means.
It means they need us. They know it. It bothers them.

And it worked. It totally charmed me.
I let him touch my boobs.
I guess I was hoping for something more, but Cara's right.
I think, when it comes to guys, there's just not a lot of layers.
So, anyway, what I'm trying to say is
it's one of the only things in life that lives up to the hype.
I mean, nothing you're gonna achieve in your career can even touch it,
so if you feel that way about Hannah, you should go and tell her.
'Cause the only thing that matters in life is if you love someone and they love you.
That's all that matters. That and your kids.
Jesus Christ! Look at the fucking ass on her.

-Forty-nine. -What?
How do you know that?

How you doing?
I think I had a nervous breakdown earlier,
but I'm cool now.
Aw, that's hella scary. Well, don't worry, Daddy.
Just don't call me "Daddy."
-What do you want me to call you? -Call me Mike.
That's no fun.
I'm gonna call you Hella Mike.
Mmm. Hella Mike.
Fuck this place, man. I don't look 49. Do I look 49?
Forty-seven.
Man, fuck you!
See that guy over there? That's a 49-year-old man.
Let me tell you something.
You have no idea how awesome I was at your age.
I was dating two chicks at the same time,
both of them named Amy, and they knew about each other.
And they loved it. Happy to share me.
I used to hang out with my boys whenever I wanted, man.
I could eat whatever I wanted, crush Rolling Rocks all day,
slept until I wasn't tired anymore.
One time, Julio Iglesias came up to me in an airport,
dead certain I was his son, Enrique.
The fucking kind of vibe I was putting out, bro!
And it was effortless. It was fucking effortless.

-That's so amazing! -Oh, thank you.
You're gonna be such a great dad.

I mean, I do love Ruth's Chris.
-I'm just so sick of your fucking excuses. -What? It's not an excuse, Cara.
I'm in actual fucking pain, which is something you can't relate to
because you block it out with your cold, reptilian mindset.
You think I'm cold?
Babe, when you open your legs,
I can actually hear the East German National Anthem.
Finally, a little fucking emotion!
Are you trying to tell me you don't wanna be with me anymore?
No. No, babe.
I'm just telling you that I don't wanna live my life this way anymore.
I would like to be less afraid of you.
You know, and maybe not have every minute of my life scheduled.
I would also like to eat carbohydrates every once in a while.
And speakin' of, would an occasional blow job fuckin' kill you?
No cap.
Did you fuckin' see that?
No cap! No cap! That means…
that means that's true!
Okay. Okay, Connor.
-No cap! No cap! -[celebratory music playing]

That's what I meant! That's what I meant!
Oh fuck.
[Jack] This is the best part of my day, every day. Still.
And things are better now.
We sent Nate to the local public school
and threw a ripper down at the VFW that raised a shitload of money for it.

but they still play tackle football, and you can pick your kids up whenever the fuck you get there.

We never did get our two hours with Doctor Lois.
Turns out she was embezzling all that money we raised for the school
to keep her creditors at bay.
But at the end of the day, she's a white woman, so she's not going to jail.
She'll probably get a book deal.
Meanwhile, that crazy Ed Cameron finally figured himself out.
He came out of the closet and ended up marrying the cute old guy from Judas Priest.
Mike sued the owners of Trifecta for age discrimination,
and we got some of our equity back.
Connor blew his share on a neck lift.
Nice!
[Jack] Life is good. And I've been in therapy, doin' the work.
Leah says she's seen a noticeable change.

Throwin' a ball around like that with a baby strapped to your chest?
You know what? I didn't even think of that.
Thank you for that information. I appreciate it.
Yeah, absolutely.

She'd say, "No, I'm going to have a son."
So, my wish was granted and I was very happy.
I'd leave for work early in the morning and return late in the evening.
From the time I got home until the next morning,
she was by my side.
She was our first child,
so I've spoiled her.
The amount of love I gave her, I wasn't able to give any other child.
I think she's received all my love, and there's nothing left for anyone else.
As her father, I deeply regret that I didn't protect her.
I feel I wasn't vigilant enough, and so this happened.
All other days when she'd go out,
I'd tell her how long she could play for,
and what time to be home.
But that day I didn't tell her, and that's my mistake.
That's what I regret most.
Every day I told her and that day I didn't.
News of a gang rape has surfaced once again.
And once again, this heinous act has shocked the public.
Last night, in the Bero district of Jharkhand,
a 13-year-old girl was gang-raped.
The incident happened while the girl was taking part
in wedding celebrations close to home.
The three accused have been arrested by the police,
and the child victim is at her home.
The rate at which reports of violence against women keep coming in,
it's time we ask ourselves,
is there something fundamentally wrong with our country?
It was the night of my nephew's wedding.
We all worked together on the wedding,
helping with anything that was needed.
So…
After dancing, around 10:00 p.m., we left.
We came home to sleep.
I woke up suddenly, around 1:00 a.m.
When I woke,
I felt very uneasy about something.
Just then, my youngest son woke up,
he needed to use the bathroom.
When I was taking him, I saw that our door was unlocked.
The latch wasn't fastened.
And that's when I realized she wasn't home yet.
I worried about where she could be.
Somewhere between 1:30 and 1:45 a.m.,
I saw her coming down the road.
When she got near the house, she stumbled and fell.
We were very scared.
We gave her some water.
After she calmed down, she started to talk.
And she told us everything.
I asked her, "Who raped you?"
She said first Kapil,
and then Langru, and then Ishwar.
In the morning we filed the case.
The police tracked their phones and caught them,
and took them to the station.
Did anyone go with you for support?
No, nobody.
-You went by yourself? -I went by myself.
We have a ward member for our village,
I called him that night for advice.
He told me,
"Go to the police station,
and I'll bring the mukhiya, district chief."
So did he help you when he got there?
Help?
No, he sided with the boys.
He said, since there were three of them, I should marry her to one of them.
And I said--
Marry one of them?
Yes, he wanted me to marry her to one of them.
And I… refused.
I can't even imagine the idea of marriage.
The rape was so violent, it caused internal injury.
Whenever I look at her, I start to cry.
She's traumatized and barely speaks.
I try to console her.
We care for her like we did when she was a small child.
After what they've done, we have to fight back.
They beat and raped a child.
RAJIV GANDHI HELP CENTER PANCHAYAT SECRETARIAT - ETTA, BERO, RANCHI
You came to the village and talked about compromise.
So I want to know from you,
they did wrong,
so you should be supporting us, but you're supporting them.
And I want to know why.
Who've you been talking to?
A lot of people are saying it.
Did you ask me?
No--
People can talk all they want,
but did you ask me what I have to say about it?
You never asked.
But why should we compromise?
I never told you to compromise.
What I said is, this is a village matter.
From my side, I'm saying you should think about it.
This isn't up for discussion.
They already killed a woman they accused of being a witch.
Which was a lie.
Whether you believe it or not.
They accused her of being a witch, and they killed her in the woods.
And now they do this.
And still people want us to support them.
How can that be?
Look, what's done is done.
Right?
If you go ahead with the case, we won't stop you.
When the villagers talked about marriage, we thought, that's a possibility.
This is what the people from your village proposed.
Did they not?
What you decide is up to you.
But think before you act.
You belong to a community, so figure out how to remain part of it.
For your own protection, really think about that.
-You spoke with the father of the girl? -Yes.
The girl's only 13 years old.
The mukhiya is taking the boys' side.
"Don't report the case, marry her to one of the boys instead."
In a criminal case, the mukhiya can't make any decisions.
He has no right to make these decisions.
Small disputes, he has the power to intervene,
but murder, rape,
to call someone a witch and murder her,
in these matters, the mukhiya cannot intervene.
He has to take it to the police.
How can they even suggest she marry a man who raped her?
It makes no sense.
There will always be those who think it should be settled within the village.
Otherwise the girl will never get married,
the family loses honor, the village loses honor…
If they get justice, this can be a game changer.
A father fighting for his daughter in a rape case… this is no small thing.
It never happens, it's very rare.
This is no ordinary family that has chosen to fight this.
But our fight isn't just with the village leadership.
This thinking is shared by many people in the village.
We have to kill this way of thinking.
Whatever violence is done against women, be it harassment or rape,
the perpetrator is always a man.
Up until ten years ago,
whatever attempts were made to change this were aimed at women.
Everyone thought we could empower women teach them to take a stand,
and that would end the discrimination and violence against them.
But that didn't happen.
What happened was a rise in the incidents of violence against them.
So we realized that working with women wasn't enough.
We need to work with men.
What are we going to learn today?
What will you teach us, tell me?
I found out recently that a girl in this village was gang-raped.
How many of you men stood up in anger?
And if none, why not?
If people are quiet, why are they quiet?
I travel to lots of villages.
People always say,
"This is a village matter, we'll settle it internally."
But on whose terms?
In my opinion, if the father has taken this to the courts,
then he's done the right thing.
Are girls born just waiting to be raped and then forced to marry?
Do they not have lives of their own?
Their own desires?
Or do they just want to be puppets that belong to men?
Shouldn't we be teaching the boys of this village,
that this is violence and it's wrong?
And if it happens again, we'll raise our voices against it,
even if it's my own brother.
We need to build support for people like you
who speak out against these things,
because when there's opposition, you need people standing with you.
Yeah, you need that.
I really like the position you've taken, that's why I'm with you.
Because you've taken this to the courts.
And that's really important in times like these.
-Shall we go? -Yes, sir.
-Okay, see you. -Okay.
There are men in the village,
who talk openly about what happened to my daughter, to mock me.
As her father, I'm blamed for not protecting her honor.
I mean, they raped my daughter,
but they shamed me.
Because…
I'm the head of our house.
Put yourself in my shoes, if I wallow in the shame…
If I just… swallow it,
and keep it inside,
and someone finds out about it later and asks me about it,
I won't be able to hold my head up.
I'd have to hang it down.
And if I stay quiet, I'll be filled with resentment,
suffocating on the inside.
And if I do nothing, I'll never be able to face those men.
I'll look at them, filled with rage,
unable to hurt them or do anything about it.
Please don't be late.
-That's okay. No problem. -That's why I'm saying this.
Okay?
I can't say.
I'll find out and let you know.
I'm just reminding you, sir…
You guys wanted this letter,
but I'm in court all day, and can't get it done.
Hey, brother?
Are you getting someone hanged?
No, not hanging anyone.
There are three accused.
The testimonies will begin after the charges are framed.
It's my job to fight for the girls who fall under the POCSO Act.
How many cases are you working?
Me?
I must be dealing with… 500 of them.
Must be about 400 or 500.
That's why I'm so busy.
I'll be back.
Turn the fan on, it's really hot.
Your case is in good hands.
He'll get you justice.
When did the prosecutor ask you to come?
He said he'd let me know.
Did you get his phone number?
No, but he took mine and said he'd call when he needs me.
Okay.
This map shows the area where the wedding took place.
So from here they took her to this other spot.
Right? So it all started here, right?
That's why the police investigated both sites and drew these maps.
This is the medical report that was submitted.
-With signatures. -Signed by all three doctors.
Legally, her testimony is already entered.
-The girl's? -Yes.
-But she'll have to testify in court. -She has to testify again.
Whatever she stated here needs to be repeated, remember that.
She needs to remember what she said.
Yes, we have to support this completely.
Langru Munda is actually my nephew.
He's family.
Our fathers were brothers.
When there's a wedding in the family, everyone goes.
If you can't go, then you send your kids,
so they can enjoy the celebrations.
That's why I left her there.
But… they didn't let her leave.
-Greetings. -Greetings.
-My name is Pushpa. You know Amit? -Yes.
I work in the same office as Amit.
I'd like to speak to your daughter.
-You're very strong. No issues in school? -No.
Is anyone bothering you?
No.
Teachers, principal, other children, nobody bothers you?
-No. -All good?
-No problem with your studies? -No.
The moment something happens, let us know.
If not me, then you know Amit who came earlier?
You can tell him too.
-Do the girls in the village talk to you? -No.
-You don't leave the house? -No.
Why not?
Listen… First you stop crying, okay? All right?
None of this is your fault.
It's okay, you've done nothing wrong.
And what you did,
going to the police and giving your statement is very brave.
The boys who did this deserve to be punished, right?
-Yes. -You've done nothing wrong, have you?
Look at me.
Don't cry, okay?
Yes.
Now tell me, when they dragged you away…
-Yes. -…who else was there?
-Nobody. -It was just the three of them?
Yes.
If it was just them, then why not go home?
I was, I was going home with my friends.
I was trying to leave, and they said I should stay.
I asked why, and they said, "Stay a little longer."
I said, "Everyone is leaving, why should I stay?"
But they insisted I stay.
They grabbed my hair, covered my mouth,
and dragged me away.
They covered your mouth, but you must have tried screaming?
Yes.
Are you absolutely sure nobody saw anything?
There could have been someone, think carefully.
There was nobody.
Okay.
The clothes she wore that day,
you took them to the station the next morning?
-Yes. -Where are they now?
Still there.
And all the medical checks were done?
Yes, medical checks were done.
Have the police called you since?
-No. -Nothing yet?
-No, nothing yet. -The boys are in custody?
Yes, all three.
Any other problems in the village or elsewhere?
Not really. Just that no one's talking to us.
I see.
-Okay, we'll meet again soon. -Okay.
Girls like you deserve a hug.
-Don't cry, okay? -Okay.
All right.
We need to find out if anyone saw anything, and what they think.
And if they aren't talking, how do they feel?
Hello to all of you sisters.
Can we speak to you briefly?
You know the incident in your village, in which a 13-year-old girl was raped.
The family says no one in the village is talking to them.
So I want to ask you,
was this the girl's fault in any way?
Yes or no?
Everyone was asleep at home, how can we know?
-All right. But-- -We can't say for sure.
The case has gone to the courts.
There'll be a lot of talk, and they'll decide who's right, who's wrong.
This could have been settled in the village.
They already had sex, might as well get them married.
-Would you marry her to all three? -To one.
-And the others? -Two are innocent, it's the one boy.
-The others did nothing? -No.
-How do you know? -I'm telling you I know.
I'm asking you how you know.
Ask your daughters,
"Tell me, child,
would you want to marry the man who raped you?"
Will any girl say yes?
Think from that perspective.
Don't think like a typical village woman.
Not everything can be resolved in your village.
This is a crime.
It's against the law to rape or murder.
But marriage is the only solution.
Her house has been shamed by that boy,
so how can having him marry her be a bad thing?
Then every boy in the village who likes a girl
will rape her so he can marry her.
Look, she can't marry another man now. She has to marry him.
For me, the village is very bad now.
Before it was really good, I used to talk to everyone.
I'd joke around with everyone, but now I don't.
"Don't be friends with her, she's very bad." That's what they say.
Does that make you think you're not a good girl?
When they say these things, I think,
maybe I'm a bit of a fool.
Otherwise, why would they target me?
Sometimes I think there's something wrong with me.
After they did what they did,
they wanted to kill her.
They told her they would kill her and dump her in a well.
I hope after what they did, they'll never be allowed to come home.
They should stay in jail for the rest of their lives and never come back.
That's what I hope.
We have small children,
and I'm afraid they'll return and do something.
It's all I think about.
I'm sad that the villagers
don't seem to care about what happened.
It's like nobody from the village wants to help us.
We'll have to do everything ourselves.
We are alone.
Do you think it's wrong that we involved the police?
No.
What's the situation like now?
I'm worried about Ranjit because…
I mean, he tells me he won't drop the case,
but there's a lot of pressure coming from the village.
You have to be alert.
Keep an eye on where he stands,
because sometimes people can change their minds.
They can turn hostile in court and change.
If they're under a lot of pressure, then they can also change their minds.
And get friendly with the mukhiya.
Try to find out what he's thinking.
Whenever I see the mukhiya,
I feel like he wants to avoid me.
How many times have you met him at his home?
-I've never been to his home. -That's my point.
These people who are "leader" types,
we have to make a point of meeting them one-on-one.
-Make sure he doesn't turn against us. -Right.
You have to be more on the ball with this case.
Yes, madam, I've arrived.
How are you feeling, Ranjit?
Are you all right?
Yes, so far so good.
Yes.
Look, is that them?
Yeah, that's them.
-That's the three? -Yeah, those three.
All the charges weren't laid yet, there's still more to come.
We have to get the next date.
-I can take them away for now? -Yes, take them away.
If I thought they were guilty, I wouldn't have taken the case.
Not one independent witness,
even though there are homes near where it supposedly happened.
If a person screams in the middle of the night, wouldn't someone hear?
After your family and everyone left, why did you stay alone with three boys?
You're also to blame.
She says she was just dancing with friends.
Well, isn't that wrong too?
Why were you there after midnight?
You can't forget you're a girl.
All women have to remember that. You, me, everyone.
This is Jharkhand, this isn't the West.
Here, I can't even trust my own son.
They say they're not guilty of any crime.
They think pleading not guilty means they'll be released.
-They're not taking it seriously at all. -No.
Now for the witnesses.
There's you, your wife, who else?
-The ward member. -Ward member.
You need to meet with him.
Will he testify in favor of the accused?
No, he won't.
Have you asked him to testify on your behalf?
He's not the kind of man who'd do the wrong thing.
-Maybe not, but still talk to him. -Yes.
Don't take that for granted.
In this situation, you don't want to presume anything.
-Okay? -Okay.
-Yes? -Okay.
I'm the village ward member,
people elected me to be the voice of the village.
All I know is what her parents told me.
Now they're dragging me to court like a criminal, saying I'm a witness.
What do I know?
Why should I bother?
Talking to you, testifying in court,
there's nothing in it for me.
The village wants to heal the divisions
and live in peace again, like we used to.
The villagers are all here.
You can interview them one by one.
No problem.
There are three accused, right?
-We brought all three. -They're the fathers?
-Yes, the fathers. -Okay.
We brought all three.
Sir, you're one of the fathers? I'd like to ask you a question.
What do you want to happen?
The villagers say he should be freed.
So what do you think I want?
He shouldn't be in jail.
He's just a school boy.
What the villagers want is what should happen.
Even though they did the crime, we seek forgiveness.
They won't do it again.
What can I say?
Have you thought about what the girl wants?
I can't speak to that.
The girl is still underage.
She has no idea how the world works.
What she wants, what she doesn't want…
She's not capable of knowing.
We'd like to know, what do you think should happen?
See, for me, what happened is really serious, and it was a child.
What I'm trying to understand is,
how do we change the way of thinking that led to this?
They are young and made a mistake.
Do we cut their throats and toss them away?
Definitely not. That's not what I think.
Then what? We need a solution that returns harmony to our village.
We have to live with Ranjit, and Ranjit has to live in this village.
No one person is more important than the community.
If the community turns its back on him, you think he'll survive on his own?
Why is this so sensitive? Because there were three.
Only one and we'd marry them.
That's the custom.
And another thing, madam,
if the girl wasn't there, would this have happened?
This is a major thing we should focus on.
Not everything boys do is wrong. Girls make mistakes too.
The way you walk, your clothes, your lipstick…
A girl always bears some blame.
A boy will only be naughty if a girl encourages him.
Ranjit should have protected his daughter's virginity.
No one will want to marry her now.
Do you think the steps you took,
when you told your mom and dad,
that you won't marry one of those boys, and you want to see them punished,
do you think that took courage?
I just think that you should do your duty,
and always do the right thing.
Never make the wrong choice.
I mean…
We weren't born to walk the wrong path.
To do good, to build a good future…
Isn't that why God created us in the first place?
Today we're talking about many things, but we don't know what the future holds.
It's not like it used to be, when your parents chose your partner,
now you can choose who you marry.
I keep thinking, will I fall in love or not? I think about that a lot.
And if I do, how do I tell him what happened to me?
I keep thinking about that.
Our case was filed today.
The next hearing date is on the 23rd, and we should be there.
The process takes a long time.
Really long.
When asked by the court,
they said they committed no crime, and plead "not guilty."
Now that the case is moving forward, they may threaten to kill us.
-Who would threaten us? -Some of their people.
When we get closer to judgment day, there'll be more of that.
With what happened to her, why would we suppress it?
Does our honor have no value?
If we don't stand up for ourselves, they'll always try to push us around.
This will go on and on…
Pain in the ass.
What do you think about your parents doing all this for you?
About your father and mother supporting you?
Come on… don't be shy.
If you're afraid now,
how are you ever going to speak in court?
Nobody's going to help you there.
The two of us are very worried,
me and my wife.
A man's capable of anything if he's angry enough…
so I need to be prepared.
In the evenings, when it gets dark, I become very alert.
I sleep less and watch over the house.
There are nights where if I sleep, she stays awake,
and if she sleeps, I stay awake.
It gets exhausting.
Hello, Rajiv sir?
I have to go to their home today for this case.
No, we don't normally do this,
but there's been no initiative shown by the father of the victim.
Two or three court dates have already passed,
and he didn't even know about them.
Let me go and see them today,
otherwise we won't be able to keep up with the case.
Tell the family they have to take the lead on this.
If the family doesn't take the initiative, then why are we sticking our necks out?
-Anybody home? -No.
Your mom and dad?
They've gone out.
Where did they go?
Father is playing cards.
He's playing cards over there.
He's playing cards? Go and get him.
Tell him we've come from Ranchi.
Go quick, run.
He's gone to Ranchi. He's not there.
He's not there?
He's in Ranchi.
When did he go to Ranchi?
He went before we came home from school.
Did he take his phone?
This number can't be reached right now.
Please try later.
Where's Ranjit?
-He's over there. -What's he doing?
You already know.
Playing cards?
Normally when they play cards, they get drunk.
So it may be a problem. He won't understand what we're saying.
We were here in the morning,
you didn't come, even though you were in the village.
I wasn't in the village, I was somewhere else.
But your kids told us you were playing cards.
Well, I was…
Yes…
November 3rd is your next date, and you have to be at court that day.
Okay.
You should be there on time, by 10:00 a.m.
You're not paying enough attention, how much can we push?
You understand that we're pushing you?
We ask you again and again to take an interest.
Don't behave this way, okay?
When you go on the 3rd, make sure you talk to the public prosecutor.
Okay.
While you're there, ask him what's happened so far,
and what happens next.
Okay.
If you don't take this seriously, neither will he.
Is he coming or not?
Where have you been?
-We're a bit late-- -A bit late? You're very late.
Monday is morning court, and court starts at 7:00 a.m.
If you keep this up, we're done.
Now it's all on you.
Witness testimony finishes at 12:00 and you're so relaxed about it all.
I'm a lawyer, and it's not my job to do your work.
Sometimes your phone's off, sometimes it's on.
I called and called, you never answered.
No, the road was really bumpy, it's impossible to hear it.
Now go find out when your new date is.
When that date comes, you have to be on time.
Morning court begins on time.
You understand, right?
-Okay? -Today…
If you'd been on time, your testimony would be done.
And answer your phone.
You should push back.
Because they're powerful, you don't say much.
They're not that powerful.
How can you say that? The case rests with them.
You're not able to say to them what's on your mind.
You don't speak firmly enough. You have to be firm.
Only then will they listen.
Don't be half-assed.
I just have to open my mouth,
and I say everything that needs to be said.
So who's stopping you?
Our rice farming didn't go well this year.
Usually we sustain ourselves for six months from the harvest,
this year didn't even get us a month.
If there's a court date,
I have to drop everything and go to court.
I have to bribe the court clerk.
If we don't pay something,
then they take no interest in what happens to our case.
I've had to borrow money.
All my money is gone.
What's the best thing about your father?
What do you like most about him?
He listens to us and respects our opinions.
And… he's kind to everyone
and loving to everyone.
Do you ever get angry with him?
Yeah, sometimes.
Over what?
He goes to the market and comes home late,
and he comes back drunk, that's why.
I didn't drink this much before.
But after what happened,
I became mentally burdened.
So I'd ask myself, "How do I do this? How can I do this?"
I know it's a bad habit,
but sometimes I feel powerless and can't resist.
What are you afraid of?
It's not a fear of any one thing,
but there are times when I'm scared at court.
What if I have to speak and the words don't come, or I falter halfway?
That's what I'm most afraid of.
Go, child, freshen up.
Go splash some water on your face.
Go.
There's so much pressure…
I have this small head, but I feel like I have this intense pressure inside it.
Sometimes I feel like I'm suffocating.
Morning and night I think, "How will I do this?"
"Can I do this?"
I'm starting to doubt
if I can keep this going.
You've had a real struggle with this legal battle.
How's the atmosphere in the village?
Not good.
-Not good. -No.
This incident has really shaken us.
But my daughter's begging me not to drop the case.
Well, I'm pleased
that we've taken on this fight together, as are my colleagues.
It's the first time in my life
that I've monitored a case this closely.
One father standing by his child,
especially a daughter, with such conviction,
other children and their fathers will find some courage,
and still more will learn from your example.
This is how people change slowly.
But without that struggle, we'd never see justice.
How has the rape affected your daughter?
Do you think she's having problems?
Something she can't talk about?
Or she talks, but only to her mother?
I know things about her that her mom doesn't know.
If there was something, she'd tell me first.
We realize
she needs an education to move past this.
If she accomplishes something
nobody in our village has done before,
she'll have proven herself.
If you become something,
the stain on you,
you can wipe that clean with a good education.
She feels the same.
There's no stain on her.
No, there isn't, but the mindset is there…
And if you're educated, you can defend yourself better.
Never suggest to her
-that there's a stain on her. -No.
There's never been a stain on your daughter.
Those who did this are the ones who should hang their heads in shame.
The stain is on them.
We'll behave normally.
We'll walk with pride, with our heads held high.
And our children will do the same.
-Yes, hello? -Hello, is this Mr. Suresh speaking?
Yes, speaking. Who are you?
I'm Jopha from the Srijan Foundation.
You know of the incident that happened in your village?
After the incident appeared in the media, the whole world knows about it.
You're named as a witness in the case.
Can we count on you to testify?
Look, I can't tell you what I'd say,
or if I'll testify or not.
How can I answer that?
We're trying to rebuild the mood in the village,
and we're thinking about a compromise for this.
It's not just my opinion, it's the whole village.
Every time there's a rape, there's a council meeting,
followed by a compromise.
My opinion is that a criminal is a criminal.
Will the honor that's been taken from the girl
be restored by a prison sentence?
How can you say that?
No, listen to me, don't be so rigid.
You can't just impose your law, you have to look at everything.
Yes…
Listen to me, listen to me, are you going to listen or just talk?
You listen to me, that girl--
No one has more sympathy for that girl than me.
You're just on a phone, and it happened in my village.
How long will you stand by her?
How long can you keep her safe?
What happens in five or seven years when they're released?
Who'll be here then?
Will the state send a bodyguard to protect her?
There's a lot to consider.
What was she doing out at midnight?
When there were no women there?
Why aren't you asking this?
Ask the girl what she went through when three men raped her.
If educated, respected people like us stand by rapists,
then where is our society headed?
Fine.
These people will get someone killed.
Who the hell are these people to speak to me?
If something happens, it's on her.
And this bloody Srijan Foundation.
Is she better than me?
If someone's killed, who gets the call? Me or her?
That woman is encouraging him, or he'd have agreed with us.
That woman from Srijan is encouraging him.
Why take so much interest in this?
There are plenty of rapists out there to fight with.
He's going to drown in this.
Not a single person will take his side.
Fight as hard as you want, you'll lose.
Is he crazy?
Ishwar's father threatened me.
The father of the youngest boy.
Suddenly he came up behind me,
and he said,
"Motherfucker…"
"Are you getting my son out of jail or not?"
"If you don't, I'll kill you and burn your house down."
Then there's the other rapist, Kapil.
Kapil's mother told me, "We won't kill you,
but we know men who will."
"Wait and see what happens."
"We won't rest until you're dead."
Do your children know what's going on? Are they aware of these threats?
When Kiran heard about the threats…
she didn't say anything,
she just started crying.
My youngest son says,
"If daddy dies, I'll die too."
"Along with him."
I'm helpless because my kids are so young.
Sometimes, I have to really think about it.
If they kill me, what happens to my children?
Ranjit, are you facing any problems because of us?
Only that when you come to my house,
they think all of you are influencing me.
"Whatever he believes, they push him further."
You're pushing me to have the boys punished.
That's what they think,
so the boys' families get angry.
It's not true,
but that's what they think.
I'm definitely worried.
The families are angry right now, and there's three of them.
The thing is, we keep going back to the village.
So we're also responsible for the tension there.
If we didn't go, things might quiet down.
He'd have filed the case anyway, but because of us, it's always in their face.
Do you ever think the villagers should be left alone?
I don't think we can leave them alone.
Stop going all together? We can't do that.
We can't just stop going.
Because that also sends the wrong message.
There's a lot to consider here.
I get scared when I think about it.
It's not like I don't.
My carelessness at the wedding led to this.
Now I know I can't be careless anymore,
because I can't afford another mistake.
My daughter always says,
"I'd rather die than give in."
If she's that brave, for such a young girl,
then I…
I'm proud of her courage.
If we've shown courage, then so has she.
When I think of her, my fear goes away.
I've lived my life.
Now I must live for my children.
Whatever happens, I have to fight to the end.
I need to speak to you about Ranjit.
He was told he'd be killed if he didn't drop the case.
The father of one of the boys threatened to burn his house down.
If you go to the police, they won't do anything.
So you can't go to them.
Ranjit needs to stand firm and take this on.
And we have to figure out what else can be done legally.
If we don't do something,
then the voices demanding he drop the case will only grow louder.
These days you never know
what someone's thinking, or what they might do.
In these situations, things can change in an hour.
What's the mukhiya like?
He sees himself as superior to others,
so he won't take kindly to
others giving him advice.
Let's see how it goes, but we have to try to influence him.
These powerful people aren't afraid of us,
but they're afraid of the law.
Whatever happens in my jurisdiction is brought to me first.
We proposed marriage between the two of them.
Was this your idea or others'?
The whole village talked about it, including her family.
The best way to save a man from being punished,
is to convince the girl's family to marry him,
and then the man escapes imprisonment.
And when you force marriage on a girl,
it's not a relationship, it's still rape.
But a man can be manipulated into it.
I've seen it happen.
I've seen innocent men arrested.
Then let a court of law determine if they're innocent.
We have no right to decide that.
You must be aware of POCSO, the new law that was passed?
If a minor, either a boy or a girl,
is sexually assaulted in any way,
or raped,
the one who did it is guilty of course.
But even if you learn about it later,
as a public official, a representative of the village,
if you don't support the victim's pursuit of justice,
then you're considered guilty as well.
Show me some nice fabric for pants and a shirt.
Black pants and a white shirt.
This is a superior quality…
It should look good.
Stand up straight.
-Hello. -Hello, Ranjit.
Yes.
You have to be at court tomorrow. You'll be there, right?
Okay, I'll be there.
Couldn't connect.
His phone's off.
This number can't be reached right now. Please try later.
Where have you been?
Let's go or we'll be late.
I was a little worried.
Worried whether you were coming or not…
What are you so worried about?
If I missed this date I'd go on the next.
It's my choice.
Why are you so worried, tell me?
There's some urgency…
What's the rush?
It's my job to get everyone there,
and if you miss a date, it could be a problem for me.
I'm not at your beck and call.
I have my own work too.
I'm not a loser like you.
In the whole village, I don't trust anyone as much as you.
I'd believe you even if you lied to me.
I'll only speak about what I know.
We're outside.
Okay, come quick.
Okay, the ward member isn't with me. I'll call him.
Yeah, I'll find him.
Okay.
His phone's off.
We're in a rush and he's wasting time.
They won't accept testimonies after 9:00 am.
What time is it now?
It's 8:45.
-Did he arrive? -What?
-Is he here? -Who? Where?
-He came this way. -Go find him.
-Would he be in your chambers? -How would he get into my chambers?
Did he run away?
They're calling for you.
Through here then straight.
Up there and around the corner.
Yeah, that way.
Here he is, sir.
Sir, I have a question about the ward member's testimony.
I couldn't hear him from the back.
You were in front, what did he say?
Was it the truth? Or did he side with them?
He said you called and told him what happened,
and you recounted all the details of that night,
and that those three men raped your daughter.
It's in your favor.
That's all I wanted to know.
Everything I said in court was true.
Whether I did the right thing or the wrong thing, I can't say.
But if someone does something wrong and truly regrets it,
then I feel they should be forgiven.
They're only human.
Even God forgives.
The stain on her can only be removed if the whole village wants it.
You think the law can erase it?
You want to hang them? Go ahead.
But the stain won't wash away.
The investigating officer is coming today.
He's testifying today.
I spoke to him, he's on his way.
Roughly what time, sir?
It'll happen when it happens.
His testimony is very important
because he conducted the whole investigation.
Everything that's been filed in the case, like the medical tests that were done,
the witness statements, he'll speak to all of this today.
So is it Samrendra Kumar Singh who's coming or--
Samrendra Kumar Singh is coming.
Got it?
-Okay, I know who he is. -Yes, go.
The officer who filed our case
was the station chief,
and he handed the case over to this man.
So…
He's not the brightest person.
He's a bit…
He's not a clear-headed man, he's not that smart,
so I have doubts that he'll be able to say what needs to be said.
He may be an officer, but he doesn't have it.
Sir, can we speak to you for two minutes?
Go ahead.
We can?
So this case that you carried out the investigation for,
what do you remember about it?
Okay.
What do you remember? Please tell us.
Can you tell us what you remember?
Well, the proceedings haven't started yet.
They'll begin soon.
What will you say?
Can you tell us, since we're not allowed in?
Please tell us what you remember.
Okay.
Okay.
Ask someone else.
Wait until I'm out, I'll come pay you a visit.
When I get out, I'll take that camera and teach them a lesson.
Film as much as you can now.
What happened?
He had no clue how to investigate a case like this.
What time did it happen? He said, "During the day."
Did you question any witnesses? "No."
"I didn't do that."
Did you examine the area?
That spot? Maybe there's blood…
or signs of a struggle?
"No."
He did none of that.
So the investigation has failed to provide the basic facts of the case.
He wasn't able to say a single thing.
He had no clue what to say.
And he's an inspector. Ridiculous.
What an asshole.
The judge said,
"You wear two stars on your shirt,
yet you can't utter a single word properly!"
Until this is resolved, I won't have peace.
I hope all our efforts won't be in vain because of this.
Those boys could very well benefit from this.
They could be released due to weak evidence.
If they're in fact guilty, this is very wrong.
Because justice won't be served.
So now the girl's testimony will be the biggest factor
in determining the judgment.
"Kapil Munda grabbed my arm and dragged me to the river bank."
"I started shouting and screaming, but nobody heard me."
Speak louder.
I'm nervous.
"Kapil Munda took off his pants
and took off my…"
"He pulled up my skirt."
"He pulled up my skirt and took off my panties."
"He started…"
"He started raping me forcefully."
"After Kapil Munda raped me,
Langru Munda also
took his turn and raped me."
Isn't it?
You have to say everything directly… look straight at them.
You have to say all this correctly.
Once more.
"I told my mother and father everything."
"After telling them…"
"We went to the police…"
"…went to the police to give my…"
-"…to give my statement." -"…statement--"
"By submitting this,
my…"
Speak louder.
She's not loud enough?
No, people will say they didn't hear something.
If she talks through her nose, they won't hear her.
How will they know what she's saying?
Keep going.
Don't stress her even more.
Go again.
Why aren't you speaking?
If you don't memorize it, then you'll stumble.
Everything depends on you.
Are you getting the sweets?
There's someone here… talking to the ladies.
So far I've taken care of it,
but we need to go.
Get your things together.
What's happening?
A man from the village is going around,
asking why you people come every day.
He's talking to people.
He's gathering all the women.
He's walking around and swearing.
He's swearing?
"These jerks come every day…" and so on.
Go speak to him.
Yeah, but leave the camera.
We need to calm them down.
Where's Ranjit?
Not home.
-Where is he? -Greetings, sir.
Greetings, how are you?
We're fine.
Sit down.
-Is he home? -What?
-Is he here? -No.
Madam, you sit too.
So… how are you?
We're fine.
I saw you at court once.
Oh, yes.
You come again and again, how long will this go on for?
When will you be done?
See, in India very few men
stand by their daughters.
And we've met this man, Ranjit, who is standing by his daughter.
So whatever he's doing,
we're filming some of it.
That's why we come to your village.
I'll tell you… this is the first village,
there's never been a rape case here until now.
Who are these people? What will they do with this?
That's what you need to ask.
They may not be doing anything wrong,
but it still disgraces our village, right?
What harm is there in filming?
Look, if they keep coming,
we have a right to know what they're doing.
Do you know why they come?
What business is that of anyone's?
Where are they coming from?
Now everybody's watching us, the filming, the court case, the police…
Don't say anything about the case or the investigation.
I won't hear of it.
We could have solved this amongst ourselves.
I'm telling you to stop all of this.
I am telling you… you tell these people here…
Tell them to stop now, before there's a problem.
It's not good for you or them.
Everyone in the village is angry.
Look, the men have been drinking and this could get bad.
Sister, you film people, you need to get out now.
Take all the things and go.
So a large crowd gathered,
and they said, "This time we'll let you go,
but next time we could kill you."
So I wanted to tell you that this had happened
because it could impact your work.
I was afraid something like this would happen.
This is a critical time
and we need to tread very carefully.
We have to make sure that no one gets hurt.
The situation around here gets aggressive really fast.
The villages in Jharkhand are very volatile.
They'll take someone's legs and just cut them off.
They won't think twice, they'll take a brick and smash you.
Even the police won't go to that village.
You spoke with Ranjit yesterday,
what does he think about all this?
Ranjit and his wife will never back down.
And as the families realize this,
their anger is growing.
They might just be getting worked up about the filming,
so we can stop that.
But we can't stop going ourselves.
Sign this please.
Sign here.
-Speak calmly and composed. Okay? -Yes.
Don't be afraid, okay?
-Okay. -Just be calm.
So we can hear you properly.
-Including the judge, okay? -Yes.
Okay.
Okay, time to go.
You come in front.
When did the incident take place? On what date?
9th April, 2017.
At what time?
12:00 midnight.
Where were you before that?
There was a wedding reception at Kartik Munda's place.
Okay.
Around midnight, while I was dancing,
Kapil Munda suddenly grabbed me by the arm,
and started dragging me to the river.
When I tried to resist, he covered my mouth.
He dragged me to the dheu tree.
Kapil Munda was followed by Ishwar and Langru Munda.
Kapil Munda threw me to the ground.
Ishwar Munda and Langru Munda,
held me down by my arms and body.
And after that,
Kapil Munda took off his pants and lifted my skirt.
He removed my panties and started raping me forcefully.
After Kapil Munda was done raping me,
Langru Munda raped me forcefully.
After Langru Munda raped me,
Ishwar Munda also raped me.
After the rape,
the three of them beat me as well.
They said if I told anyone, they would kill me.
After raping me, they left me there and ran away.
You did well.
You did better than I thought you would.
Good.
I feel relieved.
I was scared.
You know a final exam?
It was something like that.
Since you're going home after three days,
what are you looking forward to the most?
I'll chat with everyone at home,
then I'll do some chores, then I'll go out.
Where will you go?
To eat mangos.
The testimony went very well.
I was afraid, because she's a child, she might not be able to do it.
She wept, but she kept going.
And it made me feel so…
It felt good,
like we climbed the first step on the ladder of success.
If because of our case,
these incidents stop happening in our villages,
then I'll consider it a sacrifice made by my daughter.
There's nothing more noble than sacrifice.
Namaskar. Today's breaking news from Ranchi Civil Courts.
Today, after a 14-month trial,
Judge Diwakar Pandey stunned the court with a landmark decision,
the longest jail sentence ever given for the crime of rape in Jharkhand.
A shocked courtroom listened
as the three accused in the gang rape of a 13-year-old girl,
Kapil, Ishwar, and Langru Munda were each given 25 years.
When announcing his decision, the judge said,
"In a case where it relates to sexual assault
against a minor,
the court must act sternly."
In a country where a woman is raped every 20 minutes,
perhaps this case will have a ripple effect
in courtrooms across the nation. Namaskar.
Hi, Papa.
My dear,
you won.
Do you understand?
Kapil, Langru and Ishwar,
all three were found guilty.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Okay, so don't tell anybody.
Yes.
Okay.
On my way home,
I think I'll pick up sweets for the children.
How much for these?
These here.
I feel like a burden has been lifted off me.
I'm feeling relieved.
Whatever you do with an honest heart, always turns out good.
I want him to stand by me through thick and thin.
That's enough for me.
Those who walk with their steps in unison, never fail.
-Greetings, Amit. -Greetings.
Congratulations, you won the case.
We should congratulate you too, we succeeded because of your help.
It was a collective effort.
You all worked hard explaining everything we needed to do.
It was very difficult for me to understand,
but you all really helped me.
And it's because of that,
we got the outcome we did.
And it feels good.
Actually, it's all coming back to me.
It never felt like someone else's problem.
It always felt personal, and…
I feel we all worked so hard.
There were so many ups and downs,
but in the end we reached our goal.
I don't know what else to say.
I don't have the words.
You've not only sent a message to the people of your village,
but to other villages as well.
Your courage will give others courage.
You stood by your daughter like a rock.
You're an inspiration for all of us.
Your story is an example for other men to follow,
they'll learn to also fight
for the girls and women in their lives on the issues of violence and justice.
And this brings me tremendous joy.
Yes, sir.
Meanwhile, watch over and take care of your family.
You need to be alert, day and night.
Whenever you leave the house, be careful.
We'll try to stand by you in every way.
Okay, sir.
Okay then, thank you very much.
You too, sir.
"The court sentenced the three perpetrators to 25 years each,
for the gang rape of a 13-year-old child."
"On hearing the court's decision, the girl's father said,
'I was hopeful they would be severely punished.'"
"What happened to my daughter should never happen to anyone else."
"She should get justice."
What's the mood now in the village?
They're not saying anything because they're feeling ashamed.
I think some of them are happy,
but they don't come forward.
Those who mocked me
lower their heads in shame the moment they see me.
Somebody once told me,
"You can't kill a tiger by yourself."
I said to him,
"I'll show you how to kill a tiger by yourself."
I said I would kill the tiger,
and I did.
Everyone knows what they did was wrong.
But a shorter sentence would be better.
They could've reformed and not done it again.
But it went to court, they were sentenced,
who knows what happens now?
This is how the world works.
To serve 25 years in prison means half your life is over.
I think about my community,
so of course I feel bad.
I feel bad because they're all children from my village.
But the boys did wrong and there are consequences.
There's nothing left to say.
What's done is done.
I've done everything out of love.
My daughter knows that whatever she asks for,
her father will provide.
When it was my time to dream, I didn't get the chance.
Now whatever dreams I have are only for my kids.
I don't want them to be as powerless as I've been.
I want people to see that even through poverty,
