we've had in almost a year…
[Maverick] Hey.
What is it?
What?
We've been ordered to stand down. They're scrapping the program.
They say we fell short.
The contract threshold is Mach 10.
Mach 10 is supposed to be in two months. -Today's test point is Mach 9. -Well, that's not good enough.
-Today's test point is Mach 9. -Well, that's not good enough.
-Says who? -Admiral Cain.
[Hondo] The Drone Ranger.
He wants our budget for his unmanned program.
He's on his way to kill the test and shut us down personally.
Well, he isn't here yet.
They want Mach 10. Let's give 'em Mach 10.
Now, remember, the contract threshold is Mach 10.
Not 10.1. Not 10.2. Mach 10.
That should keep the program alive.
I don't like that look, Mav.
It's the only one I got.
Control, this is Darkstar. How do you read?
Darkstar, Control. Loud and clear. How me?
[Maverick] Loud and clear. Takeoff prechecks complete.
Ready for APU start.
-[Hondo] Ready, left engine start. -[engine starts, rumbles]
[Hondo] Ready, right engine start.
Thumbs for taxi.
We are ready for taxi.
[Maverick] Tower, this is Darkstar. We are taxiing with information Alpha.
[operator] Darkstar, you are clear to taxi.
Runway two-one. Winds two-one, zero-ten.
-Okay. Fuel temps are looking good. -[Hondo] Control concurs.
[Maverick] Battery's holding at 95%. Cabin pressure looks good.
[Hondo] Control concurs.
[Maverick] Tower, this is Darkstar. We're ready for takeoff.
Requesting an unrestricted climb to six-zero-zero and above.
[operator] Darkstar, the runway and skies are yours.
[engineer] Rear Admiral Chester Cain.
[Hondo] Maverick, Cain just pulled up to the gate.
It's not too late to stop, buddy.
You know what happens to you if you go through with this.
I know what happens to everyone else if I don't.
Darkstar is ready for takeoff.
Everyone, go for takeoff, starting with engine.
-Engine, go. -Thermals, go.
-Fuel, go. -Electric, go.
Control surfaces, go.
[Hondo] Darkstar, Control. You're cleared for takeoff.
All right, sweetheart. One last ride.
[Hondo] Darkstar, you are cleared above six-zero-zero. Increase to Mach 3.5.
[Maverick] Cleared above six-zero-zero. Increased to Mach 3.5.
-[tense music playing] -Admiral, uh, just in time, sir.
-[tense music playing] -Admiral, uh, just in time, sir. I'm early, so are you. You care to explain?
I'm early, so are you. You care to explain?
Transitioning to scramjet.
[Hondo] Uh, Mav, Admiral Cain is asking--
-Ordering. -Ordering that we bring her down.
Alpha, three, oh…
assing… ach… ive point four, and…
Heading posi… Six.
This is where we've had trouble with comms, sir.
It's the Earth's curvature. It's called "Earth Bulge."
Did anyone offer you a coffee?
Okay.
[engineer] He's at Mach 7, pushing 8.
-[Hondo] Flight data? -Receiving. Data is good.
Temperature's climbing. Response is still stable.
We're feeling good.
[engineer] Mach 8.8.
Eight-point-nine. Mach 9.
He's the fastest man alive.
Talk to me, Goose.
[engineer] Mach 9.1, 9.2.
Mach 9.3.
Nine-four.
Approaching high hypersonic.
Windshield hot caution.
-[device buzzing] -Surface temp rising.
Come on, sweetheart, just a little more. Just a little…
Come on!
Come on!
Put that in your Pentagon budget!
Sir.
Oh, don't do it. Don't do it.
Just…
a little push.
[softly] Holy shit.
You got some balls, stick jockey. I'll give you that.
Oh, shit.
Maverick.
Maverick!
[Maverick] Thank you.
Where am I?
Earth.
-[helicopter whirring] -[soft music concludes]
[Admiral Cain] Maverick.
Thirty-plus years of service.
Combat medals.
Citations.
Only man to shoot down three enemy planes in the last 40 years.
"Distinguished."
"Distinguished." "Distinguished."
Yet, you can't get a promotion, you won't retire.
And despite your best efforts, you refuse to die.
You should be at least a two-star admiral by now, if not a senator.
Yet here you are.
Captain.
Why is that?
It's one of life's mysteries, sir.
This isn't a joke, I asked you a question.
I'm where I belong, sir.
Well, the navy doesn't see it that way.
Not anymore.
These planes you've been testing, Captain.
One day, sooner than later, they won't need pilots at all.
Pilots that need to sleep, eat, take a piss.
Pilots that disobey orders.
All you did was buy some time for those men out there.
The future is coming.
And you're not in it.
Escort this man off the base.
Take him to his quarters. Wait with him while he packs his gear.
I want him on the road to North Island within the hour.
North Island, sir?
Call came in with impeccable timing,
right as I was driving here to ground your ass once and for all.
It… It galls me to say it, but…
for reasons known only to the Almighty and your guardian angel…
you've been called back to TOPGUN.
-Sir? -You are dismissed, Captain.
The end is inevitable, Maverick. Your kind is headed for extinction.
Maybe so, sir. [inhales]
But not today.
[Cyclone] Captain Pete Maverick Mitchell.
Your reputation precedes you.
Thank you, sir.
Wasn't a compliment.
I'm Admiral Beau Simpson. I'm the air boss.
I'm Admiral Beau Simpson. I'm the air boss. -I believe you know Admiral Bates. -Warlock, sir.
-I believe you know Admiral Bates. -Warlock, sir.
Must admit, I wasn't expecting an invitation back.
They're called orders, Maverick.
You two have something in common.
Cyclone here was first in his class back in '88.
Actually, sir, I finished second. Just want to manage expectations.
The target…
is an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant
built in violation of a multilateral NATO treaty.
The uranium produced there represents a direct threat
to our allies in the region.
The Pentagon has tasked us with assembling a strike team and taking it out
before it becomes fully operational.
The plant sits in an underground bunker at the end of this valley.
Said valley is GPS-jammed and defended by an extensive
Said valley is GPS-jammed and defended by an extensive surface-to-air missile array,
serving a limited number of fifth-generation fighters,
which in turn are backed up by a plentiful reserve of surplus aircraft.
Even a few old F-14s.
Seems like we're not the only ones holding on to old relics.
[Warlock] What's your read, Captain?
Well, sir, normally, this would be a cakewalk for the F-35 stealth, but the GPS-jamming negates that.
for the F-35 stealth, but the GPS-jamming negates that.
And a surface-to-air threat necessitates a low-level laser-guided strike
tailor-made for the F-18, I figure.
Two precision bombs, minimum.
Makes it four aircraft flying in pairs.
That is one hell of a steep climb out of there,
exposing you to all the surface-to-air missiles.
You survive that…
it's a dogfight all the way home.
All requirements for which you have real-world experience.
Not in the same mission, sir.
No.
No, someone's not coming back from this.
Can it be done or not?
How soon before the plant becomes operational?
Three weeks, maybe less.
Well, it's been a while since I've flown an F-18 and…
I'm not sure who I'd trust to fly the other three.
-But I'll find a way to make it work. -I think you misunderstand, Captain.
Sir? We don't want you to fly it. We want you to teach it.
Teach, sir?
We've recalled 12 TOPGUN graduates from their squadrons.
We want you to narrow that pool down to six.
They'll fly the mission.
Is there a problem, Captain?
You know there is, sir.
Yeah.
[Warlock] Bradley Bradshaw, a.k.a. Rooster.
I understand you used to fly with his old man.
What was his call sign?
Goose, sir.
Tragic what happened.
Captain Mitchell was cleared of any wrongdoing.
Goose's death was an accident.
[Cyclone] Is that how you see it, Captain?
Is that how Goose's son sees it?
With all due respect, sir, I'm not a teacher.
You were a TOPGUN instructor before.
That was almost 30 years ago. I lasted two months.
-It's not where I belong. -Then let me be perfectly blunt.
You were not my first choice. In fact, you weren't even on the list.
You are here at the request of Admiral Kazansky.
Now, Iceman happens to be a man I deeply admire,
and he seems to think that you have something left to offer the navy.
What that is, I can't imagine.
You don't have to take this job. But let me be clear.
This will be your last post, Captain.
You fly for TOPGUN, or you don't fly for the navy ever again.
[Coyote] Twenty bucks, you can't get three in a row.
[Penny] Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
Pete.
-Penny? -[chuckles]
-[Maverick] What are you doing here? -I should ask you the same thing.
-Well, that is a long story. -[Penny] I doubt that.
-Yeah. -Who'd you piss off this time?
-Another admiral. -Exactly.
-Are you mad at me? -[Penny] Oh, Pete.
I can never stay mad at you. That's the problem.
I got to say, North Island is the one place
I got to say, North Island is the one place I thought for sure I'd never run into you. [Maverick] Hmm.
-How long you been here? -Bought this place about three years ago.
-Three years? -[Penny] Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Not long after you got shipped off to the desert for pissing off that other admiral.
That was three years ago?
You must be in a lot of trouble. No way you'd come back here willingly.
Well… you'll sort it out.
No, I think, uh…
-I think this is it. -[Penny] Come on, Pete.
You've been saying that as long as I've known you.
You said it after they busted you for taking me on a joyride in that F-18.
-Hmm. -[Penny] Then the next thing I know, you're off to Bosnia.
Then Iraq, both times.
You get yourself in trouble…
Iceman makes a call, and you're back in the air.
-Penny, this is different. -[Penny] Pete, trust me.
As improbable as it seems right now,
somehow, you'll be back in a fighter plane with your tail on fire.
-Penny… -[Penny] Too late.
What?
You were about to ask me what time I get off.
Don't give me that look.
I'm not giving you any look, I swear.
It always ends the same with us, Pete.
Let's not start this time.
-Okay. -Okay.
You look good.
Much appreciated, pal.
What am I missing?
"Disrespect a lady, the navy, or put your cell phone on my bar…"
"…and you buy a round."
For everyone?
I'm afraid rules are rules. You're lucky it's early.
-[Coyote] Oh, come on! -What do we have here?
If it ain't Phoenix!
And here I thought we were special, Coyote.
Turns out the invite went to anyone.
Fellas, this here's Bagman.
-Hangman. -Whatever.
You're looking at the only naval aviator on active duty
-with a confirmed air-to-air kill. -Stop.
Mind you, the other guy was in a museum piece from the Korean War.
-Cold War. -Different wars, same century.
Not this one.
Who are your friends?
-Payback. -Fanboy.
-Hey, Coyote. -Hey.
-Who's he? -Who's who?
-When did you get in? -Oh, I've… I've been here the whole time.
-The man's a stealth pilot. -Literally.
Weapons systems officer, actually.
With no sense of humor.
What do they call you?
-Bob. -No, your call sign.
-Bob. -[Phoenix] Bob Floyd.
You're my new backseater? From Lemoore?
Looks like it, yeah.
Nine-ball, Bob.
Rack 'em.
Okay. [chuckles]
-[Hangman] Penny, my dear. -[Penny] Yeah.
I'll have four more on the old-timer.
[Phoenix] Bradshaw!
Is that you?
This is how I find out you're stateside?
-Yeah, I just thought I'd surprise you. -[Phoenix] Hmm.
I guess I surprised you back.
-It's good to see you. -Good to see you too.
-Here you go. -[Hangman] Thank you.
Much appreciated, Pops.
How about ringing me up before the evening rush?
Bradshaw. As I live and breathe.
Hangman, you look good.
Well, I am good, Rooster.
I'm very good. In fact, I am too good to be true.
So…
anybody know what this special detachment is all about?
No, mission's a mission. They don't confront me.
What I wanna know, who's gonna be team leader?
And which one of y'all has what it takes to follow me?
Hangman, the only place you'll lead anyone is an early grave.
Well, anyone who follows you is just gonna run out of fuel.
But that's just you, ain't it, Rooster?
You're snug on that perch, waiting for just the right moment…
that never comes.
I love this song! ♪ Slow ride ♪
Well, he hasn't changed.
Nope. Sure hasn't. ♪ Take it easy… ♪
[Hangman] Check it out.
More patches.
[Coyote] That's Harvard, Yale, Omaha. Shit, that's Fritz.
What the hell kind of mission is this?
That's not the question we should be asking.
Everyone here is the best there is.
Who the hell are they gonna get to teach us?
-It's been declined. -You're kidding.
[Phoenix] Hey, guys, come on.
[Maverick] How about…
That won't cover it.
Uh, I'll come by tomorrow and bring you the cash.
I'm afraid. Rules are rules, Pete.

[woman] Attention on deck!
[Warlock] Morning.
Welcome to your special training detachment. Be seated.
I'm Admiral Bates, NAWDC commander.
You're all TOPGUN graduates.
The elite.
The best of the best.
That was yesterday.
The enemy's new fifth-generation fighter has leveled the playing field.
Details are few, but you can be sure we no longer possess
Details are few, but you can be sure we no longer possess the technological advantage.
Success, now more than ever, comes down to the man
Success, now more than ever, comes down to the man or woman in the box.
Half of you will make the cut.
One of you will be named mission leader.
The other half will remain in reserve.
Your instructor is a TOPGUN graduate
with real-world experience in every mission aspect
you will be expected to master.
His exploits are legendary.
And he's considered to be one of the finest pilots
this program has ever produced.
What he has to teach you
may very well mean the difference between life and death.
I give you Captain Pete Mitchell.
Call sign "Maverick."
Good morning.
The F-18 NATOPS.
It contains everything they want you to know about your aircraft.
I'm assuming you know the book inside and out.
-Damn right. -Yeah!
-Damn straight. -You got it.
So does your enemy.
And we're off.
But what the enemy doesn't know is your limits.
I intend to find them…
test them, push beyond.
Today, we'll start with what you only think you know.
You show me what you're made of.
[Maverick] Rooster.
Bradley.
Lieutenant Bradshaw!
[Rooster] Yes, sir.
Let's not do it like this.
You gonna wash me out?
That'll be up to you, not me.
Am I dismissed?
Good morning, aviators. This is your captain speaking.
Welcome to basic fighter maneuvers.
As briefed, today's exercise is dogfighting.
Guns only, no missiles.
We do not go below the hard deck of 5,000 feet.
Working as a team, you have to shoot me down, or else.
-Or else what, sir? -Or else, I shoot back.
If I shoot either one of you down, you both lose.
-This guy needs an ego check. -We'll see to that.
What say we put some skin in the game? What do you have in mind?
Whoever gets shot down first has to do 200 push-ups.
[Maverick] Guys, that's a lot of push-ups.
Well, they don't call it an exercise for nothing, sir.
[Maverick] You got yourself a deal, gentlemen.
Fight's on, let's turn and burn.
[Rooster] Fanboy, you see him?
[Fanboy] Nothing on the radar up ahead. He must be somewhere behind us.
-[Fanboy] Damn it! -What the hell?
[Fanboy] Oh, shit!
[Maverick] Easy, Maverick. Let's try not to get fired on the first day.
[Fanboy] Tally, tally, tally! Maverick's coming in! -Break left! -[Payback] Breaking left.
-Break left! -[Payback] Breaking left.
[Maverick] Payback, where's your wingman?
-[Payback] Rooster, where are you? -[Rooster] I got your back.
I'm coming, hang in there, hang in there.
[Payback] Hurry up, man! Hurry up!
-[Rooster] Payback, break right. -[Payback] Breaking right.
[Maverick] Rooster just saved your life, fellas. But it's gonna cost him.
[Rooster] Not this time, old man.
[Maverick] Don't let him get to you, Maverick.
[Payback] Rooster, you're too low! Pull up! You're hitting the hard deck!
[Payback] Rooster, you're too low! Pull up! You're hitting the hard deck! -[automated voice] Altitude. Altitude. -[Rooster] Oh, shit.
-[Maverick] That's a kill. -Down! 109.
-Down! 110. -[breathes shakily]
-That should be us down there. -[Hondo] One-eleven.
-But it's not. -[Hondo] Down!
And now you know a little something about Rooster.
[Hangman] Whoo! Hey, hold that tarmac down till we get back, brother.
Get in here, good boys.
-[Maverick] That's a kill. -[Fanboy] Damn!
-[Maverick] Smoked. -[Harvard] Damn it.
It was all fun and games in that selfie, wasn't it? Down!
[Hangman] Say, Phoenix.
And how's about we tell everybody "Bob" stands for something?
[Coyote] Other than Robert. -I'm in. -[Phoenix] Don't take the bait, Bob.
Want to know why we call him Hangman?
Oh, wait, I got it. "Baby On Board."
-[plane engine rumbling] -Shit!
[Maverick] Greetings, aviators. Fight's on.
[Hangman] All right, Phoenix, let's take this guy out!
Watch your back, Phoenix.
-[Hangman] Break right! -[Phoenix] Breaking right.
[Bob] Where's he going?
[Phoenix] That's why we call him Hangman. He'll always hang you out to dry.
[Maverick] Leaving your wingman.
There's a strategy I haven't seen in a while.
[Hangman] He called you a man, Phoenix. You gonna take that?
[Phoenix] So long as he doesn't call you a man.
Talk to me, Bob, where's Maverick?
[Bob] Jesus, his nose is already coming around!
[Phoenix] Get him off me, Hangman!
[Hangman] For all you folks at home, this is how you bury a fossil.
[Maverick] All right, Hangman. Time to teach you a lesson.
-You're out, Phoenix. -[Phoenix] Son of a bitch!
[Maverick] That's it.
[Hangman] Let's go, Mav. Let's see what you got. [Maverick] Come get me.
[Hangman] Evil be gone, Hangman's coming.
[Maverick] Yeah, you're good. I'll give you that.
[Hangman] Shit. Phoenix, I can't see him. How close am I?
-Phoenix? -I'm dead, dickhead.
-See you in the afterlife, Bagman. -[scoffs]
-[Hangman] Where is he? Where is he? -[Maverick] That's a kill.
Seventy-nine, down. Eighty, down.
[Maverick] Let's go, who's next?
-I got you, Omaha. -[Omaha] Damn it!
-[Maverick] Lights out, Coyote. -Copy kill.
[Hondo] Down, 51. Down, 52.
[Hangman] So, Rooster, mind if I ask you a personal question?
[Rooster] Would it matter if I did?
[Hangman] So, what's the story with you and Maverick?
-It seems like he's got you rattled. -[Rooster] That's none of your business.
-Now where the hell is he? -[Maverick] Been here the whole time.
[Hangman] Holy shit.
[Maverick] You see me now?
Come on, let's get it over with.
[Rooster breathes heavily] Fight's on!
[Hangman] What is with these two?
[Maverick] All right, you put us here. How you gonna get yourself out?
[Rooster] You can bail out anytime.
[Maverick] How low you wanna go, Rooster?
[Rooster] I can go as low as you, sir! And that's saying something.
[Maverick] What's past is past. For both of us.
[Rooster] You'd like to believe that, wouldn't you?
[Hangman] Hard deck is 5,000 feet, fellas. You are running out of room.
[Maverick] Your strategy is about to run us into the ground.
-[Rooster] What's your move? -[automated voice] Altitude. Altitude.
Altitude.
-Altitude. Altitude. -[Rooster breathing heavily] [automated voice] Altitude. Altitude. Altitude.
[automated voice] Altitude. Altitude. Altitude.
-Pull up! Pull up! Pull up! Pull up! -[Maverick grunts]
[automated voice] Pull up! Pull up!
[Hangman] You got it. Don't think, just do.
Come on, Rooster, you got him! Drop down and take the shot!
[Rooster] It's too low.
[Maverick] Too late, you had your chance.
That's a kill, knock it off. [breathes heavily]
-[Rooster] Damn it! [breathes heavily] -[Hangman] Same old Rooster.
[Maverick] Go see Hondo about your push-ups.
All right, that's enough.
Rooster, that's enough, man.
[Phoenix] Breaking the hard deck, insubordination. -Are you trying to get kicked out? -Don't worry about it.
-Are you trying to get kicked out? -Don't worry about it.
Look, I'm going on this mission.
But if you get kicked out, you leave us flying with Hangman.
-Talk to me. What the hell was that? -He pulled my papers.
-What? Who? -[Rooster] Maverick.
He pulled my application to the Naval Academy.
Set me back four years.
Why would he do that?
[Cyclone] The hard deck is 5,000 feet above ground level.
A parameter is set not just for the safety of our pilots,
but for the safety of their aircraft.
Five thousand feet is not just a rule. It is a law, as immutable as gravity.
The hard deck will be much lower for the mission, sir.
And it will not change without my approval!
Especially not in the middle of an exercise.
And that cobra maneuver of yours? That could've got all three of you killed.
I never want to see that shit again.
What exactly do you suppose you were teaching, Captain?
That as good as they are, sir, they still have something to learn.
You are talking about the best fighter pilots on the planet, Captain.
And they've been told that their entire career,
while they've been dropping bombs from a high altitude
with little to no dogfighting.
The parameters of this mission call for something they have never encountered--
Okay, you have less than three weeks to teach them how to fight as a team…
-and how to strike the target. -And how to come home.
And how to come home, sir.
Every mission has its risks. These pilots accept that.
I don't, sir.
Every morning, from this day forward,
you will brief us on your instructional plans in writing.
And nothing will change without my express approval.
-Including the hard deck, sir? -Especially the hard deck, Captain.
-[Maverick] Sir. -What is this?
It's a request to lower the hard deck, sir.
To practice a low-level bombing run per the mission parameters.
You could learn a thing or two about timing, Captain.
[Hangman] Yo, Coyote.
Take a look at this.
[Coyote] The man, the legend, there he is.
No, no, no. Next to him.
He look familiar to you?
What have we here?
[Hangman] "Bradshaw."
As I live and breathe.
-[Maverick] Hey, Theo, you got big. -[Amelia] Hey, Mav.
Amelia?
-I know. I got big. -[chuckles] Yes.
Bar opens at 5:00.
-No, I just came by to pay off a debt. -[Amelia] Mom!
-Hey, how's your dad? -With his wife, in Hawaii.
Mom!
Mav says he owes you money.
-Oh, don't worry about it. -I insist.
Thank you, Captain. Consider your tab closed.
Captain? Still?
-A highly decorated captain. -Finish up.
We have to get the boat to the yard.
-[Amelia] I can't go. -What do you mean you can't go?
[Amelia] Test tomorrow, I have to study. They only told us today.
Well, I can't sail her alone.
Just use the engine.
[Penny] Why are we taking her to the yard?
-To fix the engine. -[Penny] To fix the engine. [chuckles]
I can help.
[Penny] Little rougher than I was expecting. [Maverick] You don't say.
Pull on the backstay. De-power the sail.
Okay.
What does that mean?
You're supposed to be in the navy!
I don't sail boats, Penny. I land on them.
It's sort of like raising the flaps on an airplane.
-[Maverick] So how do I do that? -You pull on that green line up there.
Green line.
[Penny] Yep, pull it hard.
Yep, crank that winch right there,
tighten the jib.
-Crank it. You okay? -Yeah.
Good.
Now… you ready?
-[Maverick] For what? -The afterburner.
Now you're in the navy.
[Penny] Thanks for helping out today.
I'm not exactly sure I helped.
Don't give me that look.
-What look? -[Penny] That one.
Good night, Pete.
Night, Penny.
-[Amelia] Mom, is that you? -[Penny] Yeah, it's me.
-I'll make you dinner. -[Amelia] Okay.
Time is your greatest enemy.
Phase one of the mission will be a low-level ingress
attacking in two-plane teams.
You'll fly along this narrow canyon to your target.
Radar-guided surface-to-air missiles defend the area.
These SAMs, they're lethal.
But they were designed to protect the skies above, not the canyon below.
That's because the enemy knows no one is insane enough to try and fly below them.
That's exactly what I'm gonna train you to do.
On the day, your altitude will be 100 feet maximum.
You exceed this altitude, radar will spot you…
-[device beeps] -[Maverick] …and you're dead.
Your airspeed will be 660 knots.
Minimum.
Time to target, two and a half minutes.
That's because fifth-generation fighters wait at an air base nearby.
In a head-to-head with these planes in your F-18s, you're dead.
That's why you need to get in, hit your target and be gone
before these planes even have a chance of catching you.
This makes time your greatest adversary.
[Maverick] You'll fly a route in your nav system that simulates the canyon.
The faster you navigate this canyon,
the harder it'll be to stay under the radar of these enemy SAMs.
-[Phoenix grunts] -[Maverick] The tighter the turns,
the more intensely the force of gravity -on your body multiplies… -[Hangman grunts]
[Maverick] …compressing your lungs,
forcing the blood from your brain. Impairing your judgment and reaction time.
So for today's lesson, we're gonna take it easy on you.
Max ceiling, 300 feet. Time to target, three minutes.
Good luck.
[Bob] Time to target is one minute 30.
We are two seconds behind. Increase to 480 knots.
[Phoenix] We got to move, Coyote.
[Phoenix] Shit!
Why are they dead?
We broke the 300-foot ceiling, and a SAM took us out.
No, why are they dead?
I slowed down and didn't give a warning, it was my fault.
Was there a reason you didn't communicate with your team?
-I was focusing on-- -One that their family will accept
-I was focusing on-- -One that their family will accept at the funeral.
None, sir.
Why didn't you anticipate the turn? You were briefed on the terrain.
Don't tell me, tell it to his family.
[Payback] Hangman, ease up. The canyon's getting tighter.
[Hangman] Negative, Payback. Increase your speed.
[Payback] You're going too fast, man. [Hangman] Well, no harm in being ahead of schedule.
[Payback] Damn it, slow down! I can't stay on the course!
[Fanboy] You're gonna hit the wall! Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!
-[device beeps] -What happened?
[Hangman] Well, I flew as fast as I could.
Kind of like my ass depended on it.
And you put your team in danger and your wingman's dead.
They couldn't keep up.
[Yale] Rooster, we're 20 seconds behind and dropping.
[Rooster] We're fine, speed is good.
[Yale] Increase to 500 knots.
[Rooster] Negative, Yale. Hold your speed. [Yale] Rooster, we're late!
[Rooster] We're alive. We'll make up time in the straightaway.
[Yale] We are not gonna make it.
[Rooster] Just trust me. Maintain your speed, we can make it.
-Why are you dead? -[suspenseful music concludes]
[Maverick] You're team leader up there. Why are you, why is your team, dead?
Sir, he's the only one who made it to the target.
A minute late.
He gave enemy aircraft time to shoot him down.
-He is dead. -You don't know that.
You're not flying fast enough. You don't have a second to waste.
We made it to the target.
And superior enemy aircraft intercepted you on your way out.
-Then it's a dogfight. -Against fifth-generation fighters.
-[Rooster] Yeah, we'd still have a chance. -[Maverick] In an F-18.
It's not the plane, sir, it's the pilot.
Exactly!
There's more than one way to fly this mission.
On this mission, a man flies like Maverick here,
or a man does not come back.
No offense intended.
Yet somehow you always manage.
Look, I don't mean to criticize. You're conservative, that's all.
-Lieutenant. -[Hangman] We're going into combat, son, on a level no living pilot's ever seen.
Not even him.
That's no time to be thinking about the past.
-What's that supposed to mean? -Rooster.
I can't be the only one that knows -that Maverick flew with his old man. -That's enough.
-that Maverick flew with his old man. -That's enough. Or that Maverick was flying, when his old man--
Or that Maverick was flying, when his old man--
-Lieutenant, that's enough! -[Phoenix] Hey! Hey!
-That's enough. -You son of a bitch!
[Payback] Hey, come on!
I'm cool. I'm cool. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[Maverick] That's enough.
[Hangman] He's not cut out for this mission.
-That's enough! -You know it.
You know I'm right.
You're all dismissed.
Maverick…
It's come back?
No one knows.
There's nothing else they can do. Even speaking is painful now.
Sarah, I'm so sorry.
Admiral.
How's my wingman?
Please, don't worry about me.
What can I do for you?
All right.
Well, Rooster's still angry with me about what I did.
I thought eventually he would understand why.
I hoped he'd forgive me.
The mission is less than three weeks away.
The kid's not ready.
He doesn't want what I have to give.
Ice, please, don't ask me to send someone else to die.
Please don't… [inhales deeply]
…don't ask me to send him.
Send me.
I don't know how.
I'm not a teacher, Ice.
I'm a fighter pilot.
A naval aviator.
It's not what I am.
It's who I am.
How do I teach that?
Even if I could teach it, it's not what Rooster wants.
It's not what the navy wants.
That's why they canned me the last time.
The only reason I'm here is you.
If I send him on this mission…
he might never come home.
And if I don't send him, he'll never forgive me.
Either way, I could lose him forever.
I know. I know.
The navy needs Maverick.
The kid needs Maverick.
That's why I fought for you.
That's why you're still here.
[Maverick] Thank you, Ice, for everything.
One last thing, who's the better pilot?
You or me?
This is a nice moment, let's not ruin it.
-♪ Honey, maybe so… ♪ -All right. ♪ But I ain't worried 'bout it right now ♪
♪ Swimmin' in the floods… ♪ -Touchdown! -♪ Dancing on the clouds below ♪
[Rooster] Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
-Hey! Rooster! -♪ I ain't worried 'bout it… ♪
-[Maverick] Sir? -What is this?
This is dogfight football. Offense and defense at the same time.
[Cyclone] Who's winning?
I think they stopped keeping score a while ago.
This detachment still has some training to complete, Captain.
-Every available minute matters. -Yes, sir.
So why are we out here playing games?
You said to create a team, sir.
There's your team. ♪ I ain't worried 'bout it… ♪
[all] Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob!
Should I go? Before Amelia gets back?
-She'll be at her friend's house tonight. -Good.
You and Amelia, you seem…
…a lot closer than when I last saw you.
-Yeah. Yeah, we are. -How do you manage?
Well…
you know, she always wanted more freedom than I thought she was ready for.
[Maverick] Hmm. Where'd she get that from, -I wonder? -[chuckles]
I guess I realized I also had to trust her.
Let her make some of her own mistakes sometimes.
-Not an easy choice. -[Penny] Hmm.
Is that what happened with Rooster?
I pulled his papers from the Naval Academy.
Took years off his career.
Why?
His mother never wanted him to fly, not after what happened to Goose.
She made me promise before she died, so…
Does Rooster know that?
He will always resent me for what I did.
Why should he resent her too?
-Not an easy choice. -[Maverick] Hmm.
I was trying to be the father he lost.
I just…
I wish I would've done it better.
But… the truth is…
I didn't think he was ready.
Is he ready now?
-[door closing] -[Amelia] Mom, I'm home!
I thought you were staying at Karen's tonight.
[Amelia] Karen's sick. And I've got homework to do.
-I should go. -You should go. [sighs]
-Have you had dinner yet? -[Amelia] Not yet, you wanna go out?
No, it's okay. I'll make you something.
I'll be down in a sec!
-Wait! Not that way. -What?
Look… Look, I have an example to set.
I can't be bringing guys home on a first date.
This is not our first date.
You know what I mean.
Okay.
Fine.
But this is the last time I go out your window.
-We'll see. -No. No, I mean it.
I'm never gonna leave you again.
Oh, shut up. [smooches]
Go on, get out of here.
Just don't break her heart again.
[Warlock] Good morning.
The uranium enrichment plant that is your target
will be operational earlier than expected.
Raw uranium will be delivered to the plant in ten days' time.
As a result, your mission has been moved up one week,
in order to avoid contaminating the target valley with radiation.
Sir, no one here has successfully flown a low-level course.
Nevertheless, you've been ordered to move on.
-Captain. -[intense music playing]
[Maverick] We have one week left to focus on phase two.
It's the most difficult stage of the mission.
It's a pop-up strike with a steep dive,
requiring nothing less than two consecutive miracles.
Two pairs of F-18s will fly in a welded-wing formation.
Teamwork. Precise coordination of these aircraft is essential
to both the mission's success and your survival.
As you know, the plant rests between two mountains.
On final approach, you'll invert directly into a steep dive.
This allows you to maintain the lowest possible altitude.
And the only possible attack angle.
Your target is an impact point less than three meters wide.
The two-seat aircraft will paint the target with a laser bullseye.
[Maverick] The first pair will breach the reactor
by dropping a laser-guided bomb on an exposed ventilation hatch.
[Maverick] This will create an opening for the second pair.
That's miracle number one.
The second team will deliver the kill shot…
and destroy the target.
That's miracle number two.
If either team misses the target…
-[Hangman] That's a miss. -[Maverick] …the mission is a failure.
-[Hangman] That's a miss. -[Maverick] …the mission is a failure. [Rooster] Damn it!
[Maverick] Egress is a steep high-G climb out to avoid hitting this mountain.
A steep climb at that speed, you're pulling at least eight G's.
Nine, minimum.
The stress limit of the F-18's airframe is seven point five.
[Maverick] That's the accepted limit.
To survive this mission, you'll pull beyond that,
even if it means bending your airframe.
[Maverick] You'll be pulling so hard, you'll weigh close to 2,000 pounds,
-your skull crushing your spine… -[Phoenix] Fuck.
[Maverick] …your lungs imploding like an elephant's sitting on your chest,
fighting with everything you have just to keep from blacking out.
And this is where you'll be at your most vulnerable.
This is Coffin Corner.
Assuming you avoid crashing into this mountain,
you'll climb straight up into enemy radar while losing all of your airspeed.
Within seconds, you'll be fired upon by enemy SAMs.
You've all faced sustained G's before, but this,
this is gonna take you and your aircraft to the breaking point.
Sir, is this even achievable?
The answer to that question will come down to the pilot in the box.
-[Phoenix] Talk to me, Bob. -[Bob] We are 12 seconds late on target.
-We gotta move! We gotta move! -[Phoenix] Shit. [Coyote] Copy, try to stay with me.
[Coyote gasps] Wait, who's that?
[Maverick] Blue Team, you've been spotted.
-[Coyote] Shit, it's Maverick. -[Phoenix] What the hell is he doing here?
[Maverick] I'm a bandit on course to intercept. Blue Team, what are you gonna do?
[Bob] He's 20 miles left. Ten o'clock. Seven hundred knots closure.
[Coyote] Your call. What do you want to do?
[Phoenix] Continue, we're close. Stay on target.
-[Bob] He's swinging around to the north! -[Coyote] Stand by for pop-up.
-[Phoenix] Be ready on that laser, Bob. -[Bob] Copy, I'm on it.
[Maverick] Blue Team, bandit is still closing.
[Coyote] Talk to me, Bob. Where's Maverick?
[Bob] He's five miles out, he's coming fast.
-[Phoenix] Target's in sight. -[Coyote] Where's my laser, Bob?
[Bob] Deadeye! Deadeye! It's no good. Sorry, I can't get a lock.
[Coyote] We're out of time, I'm dropping blind.
-[explosion] -[Coyote] Damn it, missed!
-[beeps] -[Maverick] That's tone. [Coyote] Maverick's got missile lock on us.
[Phoenix] Shit! We're dead.
[Maverick] Blue Team, that's a fail. Level out, Coyote.
Coyote? Do you copy?
Coyote, come in.
Coyote, level wings.
Oh, my God, he's in G-LOC.
Coyote? Coyote?
-[Phoenix] He's gonna burn in! -[Maverick] I'm going after him.
[Maverick] Come on. Give me tone, give me tone, give me tone!
-[beeps] -[Maverick] Snap out of it, Coyote. Come on! Come on!
Come on, Coyote. Come on, come on!
-God damn it! Coyote! -[Phoenix] Pull up! -[Maverick] Coyote! Coyote! -[Phoenix] Pull up!
-[Maverick] Coyote! Coyote! -[Phoenix] Pull up!
[Maverick] Coyote, you okay? You okay?
[Maverick] Good. Good. That's enough for today.
[Phoenix] That was close.
[Maverick] Too close.
-Bird strike! Bird strike! -[Phoenix] Bird strike!
-[Bob] Phoenix, left engine's on fire! -[Phoenix] Climbing.
Throttling back. Shutting off fuel to left engine. Extinguishing fire.
[Bob] Right engine is out!
[Bob] Right engine is out! [Phoenix] It's still spinning. Try to restart it.
[Maverick] Phoenix, it's on fire, don't start-- [Phoenix] Throttling up.
[Maverick] Oh, my God.
-[Bob] We're on fire! We're on fire! -[Phoenix] Damn it!
-[automated voice] Engine fire. Right. -[Phoenix] Extinguishing right engine.
[Maverick] Phoenix, Bob, punch out! Punch out!
[Bob] Warning lights everywhere! Hydraulic failure!
-[operator] Flight controls. -[Phoenix] I can't control it.
[Bob] We're going down, Phoenix! We're going in! We're going in!
[Maverick] You can't save it. Eject! Eject!
-[Phoenix] Eject! Eject! Eject! -[automated voice] Altitude. Altitude.
They'll keep Phoenix and Bob in the hospital overnight for observation.
They're gonna be okay.
That's good.
I've never lost a wingman.
You're lucky.
Fly long enough, it'll happen.
There will be others.
Easy for you to say, no wife.
No kids.
Nobody to mourn you when you burn in.
Go home.
Just get some sleep.
[Rooster] Why'd you pull my papers at the Academy?
Why did you stand in my way?
-You weren't ready. -Ready for what?
-Huh? Ready to fly like you? -[Maverick] No. Ready to forget the book.
Trust your instincts. Don't think, just do.
You think up there, you're dead. Believe me.
My dad believed in you.
I'm not gonna make the same mistake.
[Warlock] Maverick…
[officer] Ready, aim, fire.
-Ready, aim, fire. -[gunshots]
-[officer] Ready, aim, fire. -[gunshots]
[Cyclone] I can only imagine what you must be feeling right now.
Take some time, whatever you need.
I appreciate that, sir, but there is no time. The mission--
I'll be taking over the training from here.
Sir?
We both know you didn't want this job, Captain.
-Sir, they're not ready. -Well, it was your job to get them ready.
Sir, they have to believe that this mission can be flown.
And all you've managed to do is teach them that it can't.
-Sir-- -[Cyclone] You're grounded, Captain.
Permanently.
-Sir-- -That is all.
I heard.
I'm sorry.
What are you gonna do?
Ice is gone.
What choice do I have?
You'll have to find a way back on your own.
[Maverick] No, Penny.
I'm out.
This is over.
Pete, if you lost your wingman up there…
you'd keep fighting.
You wouldn't just give up.
Those are your pilots.
If anything happens to them…
you'll never forgive yourself.
I don't know what to do.
But you'll find a way.
I know you will.
[Cyclone] Captain Mitchell is no longer your instructor.
And as of today, there are new mission parameters.
-Time to target is now four minutes. -[beeps]
You'll be entering the valley level at reduced speed.
Not to exceed 420 knots.
Sir, won't we be giving their planes time to intercept?
Well, Lieutenant, you have a fighting chance against enemy aircraft.
What are the odds of surviving a head-on collision with a mountain?
You'll be attacking the target from a higher altitude,
level with the north wall.
Gonna be a little harder to keep your lase on target,
but you will avoid the High-g climb out.
We'll be sitting ducks for enemy missiles.
-Who the hell is that? -[suspenseful music playing]
[Maverick] Maverick to Range Control, entering Point Alpha.
Confirm green range.
[operator] Uh, Maverick, Range Control,
uh, green range is confirmed.
uh, green range is confirmed. I don't see an event scheduled for you, sir.
[Maverick] Well, I'm going anyway.
Nice.
[Maverick] Setting time to target, two minutes 15 seconds.
Two-fifteen? That's impossible.
[Maverick] Final attack point. Maverick's inbound.
[Maverick] Pumping in three, two, one.
[Maverick] Bombs away.
-[Rooster] Bullseye! Holy shit! -[Coyote groaning]
[Rooster] Yes.
Damn.
[Cyclone] You have put me in a difficult position, Captain.
On the one hand, you have demonstrated that this mission can be flown.
Perhaps the only way it can be survived.
On the other hand,
you did it by stealing a multimillion-dollar military aircraft
and flying it in such a manner that it may never be airworthy again.
Iceman is no longer here to protect you.
I have everything I need to have you court-martialed
and dishonorably discharged.
So what do I do?
Risk the lives of my pilots and perhaps the success of this mission?
Or…
risk my career…
by appointing you team leader?
Sir--
I think the admiral's asking a rhetorical question, Captain.
Talk to me, Goose.
[Warlock] Captain Mitchell!
You're where you belong.
Make us proud.
It has been an honor flying with you.
Each one of you represents the best of the best.
This is a very specific mission.
My choice is a reflection of that and nothing more.
Choose your two Foxtrot teams.
Payback and Fanboy.
Phoenix and Bob.
[Warlock] And your wingman.
Rooster.
The rest of you will stand by on the carrier
for any reserve role that's required.
Dismissed.
[Warlock] Your target is a clear and present threat.
A secret uranium enrichment site under rogue state control.
It's an underground bunker tucked between these two mountains.
Your route of ingress is heavily defended by surface-to-air missiles
backed up by fifth-generation fighters.
Once your F-18 strike team crosses the border,
Tomahawk missiles from the USS Leyte Gulf
will launch a synchronized strike on the enemy's airfield here.
This will knock out their runway.
But you'll have to contend with any planes already in the air.
The moment those Tomahawks hit, the enemy will know you're coming.
Your time to target will be two minutes and 30 seconds.
Any longer than that, and you will be exposed to any aircraft
Any longer than that, and you will be exposed to any aircraft the Tomahawks may have missed.
This is what you've all been training for.
Come home safely.
You give 'em hell!
Sir? Sir!
I…
I just want to say--
[operator] All aboard the aircraft, get 'em all.
We'll talk…
when we get back.
Hey, Bradley! Bradley!
Hey.
You got this.
[Hondo] Maverick.
Maverick?
Hey, you with me?
I don't like that look, Mav.
It's the only one I got.
Thank you.
If I don't see you again, Hondo, thank you.
It's been an honor, Captain.
[Maverick] Dagger One, up and ready on Catapult One.
[Hangman] Dagger Spare standing by.
Dagger Four, up and ready.
-Dagger Three, up and ready. -[Rooster] Dagger Two, up and ready.
[comms-crew tech] Support assets airborne. Strike package ready.
Standing by for launch decision.
Send them.
[comms-crew tech] Dagger Two away.
Dagger Three away.
Dagger Four away.
[Maverick] Comanche. Dagger One, standby check in.
Comanche one-one, set. Picture clean, recommend Dagger continue.
[Maverick] Copy. Daggers descending below radar.
[comms-crew tech] Daggers now below radar. Switching to E-2 picture.
[Maverick] Here we go. Enemy territory up ahead.
Feet dry in 60 seconds. Comanche, Dagger One. Picture.
Comanche. Picture clean. Decision is yours.
[Maverick] Copy.
Dagger attack.
[comms-crew tech 2] Tomahawks airborne.
No turning back now.
[Maverick] Daggers, assume attack formation.
Daggers set. Proceeding to target.
Two minutes and 30 seconds in three, two, one, mark.
-[Rooster] Two mark. -[Phoenix] Three mark.
[Payback] Four mark.
[Maverick exhales] Going in.
First SAM site overhead.
[Phoenix] Looks like we're clear on radar, Mav.
[Maverick] Let's not take it for granted.
[Rooster pants] More SAMs! Three o'clock high!
[Bob] We got two minutes to target. [Fanboy] Copy. We're two seconds behind, Rooster. We got to move.
[Fanboy] Copy. We're two seconds behind, Rooster. We got to move.
[comms-crew tech 2] Thirty seconds to Tomahawk impact on enemy airstrip.
-[beeps] -[comms-crew tech] Dagger, Comanche.
We're picking up two bandits. Single group, two contacts.
-Where the hell they come from? -Long-range patrol?
[Phoenix] Comanche, what's their heading?
[comms-crew tech] Bullseye 09, 050, tacked southwest.
[Rooster] They're headed away from us. They don't know we're here.
[Maverick] The second those Tomahawks hit the air base,
those bandits are gonna move to defend the target.
We have to get there before they do, increase speed.
[Phoenix] We got you, Mav. Don't wait for me.
[comms-crew tech] Sir, Daggers Two and Four are behind schedule.
Time to target, one minute 20.
[comms-crew tech 2] Tomahawk impact in three, two…
[comms-crew tech 2] Impact, enemy runway is destroyed.
They know we're coming now.
[comms-crew tech] Bandits are switching course to defend the target.
[Maverick] Rooster, where are you?
[Fanboy] Come on, Rooster. Bandits inbound.
We got to make up time now. Let's turn and burn.
Heads up, Phoenix.
[comms-crew tech] Sir, bandits are two minutes from target. Daggers are one minute from target.
Come on, Rooster. Move it or lose it.
[Fanboy] Guys, we're falling behind. We really gotta move.
If we don't increase our speed, right now,
those bandits are gonna be waiting for us when we reach the target.
[Rooster] Talk to me, Dad.
[Maverick] Come on, kid, you can do it. Don't think, just do.
[Payback] Jesus, Rooster, not that fast!
-[Maverick] That's it, kid, that's it. -[Rooster] All right, let's go.
[Fanboy] Damn, Rooster, take it easy.
[comms-crew tech] Sir, Dagger Two is reengaging.
All right, now hit your target and come home.
[Maverick] Thirty seconds to target. Bob, check your laser.
[Bob] Air-to-ground check complete. Laser code verified, 1688.
Laser is a go!
[Fanboy] Oh, shit! Shit!
-[Rooster] Payback, you with me? -[Payback] Right behind you.
[Maverick] Phoenix, stand by for pop-up strike.
[Phoenix] Dagger Three in position.
[Maverick] Popping in three, two, one.
[Maverick] Get me eyes on that target, Bob. [Bob] Dagger Three.
-Stand by, Mav. -[Maverick] Come on, Bob, come on.
-Stand by, Mav. -[Maverick] Come on, Bob, come on. [Bob] Stand by.
-I've got it. Captured! -[Maverick] Target acquired. Bombs away.
[Bob] We've got impact! Check, direct hit! Direct hit!
That's miracle number one.
[Maverick] Dagger Two, status.
[Rooster] Almost there, Mav. Almost there.
Fanboy, where's my laser?
[Fanboy] Rooster, there's something wrong with this laser!
Shit! Deadeye! Deadeye! Deadeye!
[Maverick] Come on, guys, we're running out of time. Get it online!
-[Fanboy] I'm trying! I'm trying! -[Maverick] Come on, Fanboy!
[Fanboy] Nearly there! Nearly there!
[Payback] Come on, Fanboy, get it online. [Rooster] There's no time. I'm dropping blind.
-[Fanboy] Rooster, I got this! I got this! -[Rooster] No time. Pull up.
-[Payback] Rooster, wait! -[Rooster] Bombs away! Bombs away!
-[Phoenix] Bullseye! Bullseye! Bullseye! -[crowd cheers]
Miracle number two.
Now they're in Coffin Corner.
[Maverick] We're not out of this yet.
-Here it comes. -[radar buzzing]
[Maverick] Radar warning! Smoke in the air. Phoenix, break right.
[Phoenix] Emergency jettison. Dagger Three defending.
-[Bob] Here comes another one! -[Maverick] Dagger One defending.
[Maverick] Rooster, status.
[Rooster] Oh, my God.
Smoke in the air! Smoke in the air!
[Fanboy] Break right, Payback! Break right!
-[Payback] Breaking right. -[Fanboy] Oh, my God! Here they come!
[Payback] SAM on your six, Rooster!
[Rooster] Deploying countermeasures.
-[explosion] -[Rooster] Negative contact.
[Maverick] Dagger One defending.
-[Phoenix] Talk to me, Bob. -[Bob] Break right, Phoenix! Break right!
Mav, nine o'clock! Nine o'clock!
[Payback] Rooster, two more on your six.
[Rooster] Dagger Two, defending.
-[Maverick] Payback, SAM on your nose. -[Payback] Dagger Four defending.
-[Bob] Rooster, tally, seven o'clock! -[Phoenix] Talk to me, Bob!
-[Bob] On our six! -[Rooster] Dagger Two defending.
-[Maverick] Phoenix, break right! -[Phoenix] I see it! I see it!
[Rooster grunts] Dagger Two defending.
Shit, I'm out of flares!
[Maverick] Rooster, evade, evade!
[Rooster] I can't shake 'em! They're on me! They're on me!
-[Rooster] Mav! -[explosion]
[Rooster] Mav! No!
[Phoenix] Dagger One is hit! I repeat, Dagger One is hit!
Maverick is down.
[Rooster] Dagger One, status! Status!
Anyone see him? Does anyone see him?
-Dagger One, come in! -[Payback] I didn't see a parachute.
We have to circle back.
[comms-crew tech] Comanche. Bandits inbound. Single group, hot.
Recommend Dagger flow south.
One minute to intercept.
-Get 'em back to the carrier now. -All Daggers flow to ECP.
-Get 'em back to the carrier now. -All Daggers flow to ECP. -You have bandits headed for you. -[Rooster] What about Maverick?
-You have bandits headed for you. -[Rooster] What about Maverick?
Tell him there's nothing he can do for Maverick, not in a goddamn F-18.
Dagger Spare request permission to launch and fly air cover.
Negative, Spare.
-Launch search and rescue. -Negative. Not with bandits in the air.
-But, sir, Maverick is still out there. -We are not losing anyone else today.
Get 'em home now.
-[keyboard keys clacking] -Dagger, you are not to engage.
Repeat, do not engage.
[comms-crew tech] Dagger Two, return to carrier. Acknowledge.
Acknowledge.
[Phoenix] Rooster, those bandits are closing. We can't go back.
[Bob] Rooster, he's gone.
-Maverick's gone. -[Rooster pants]
No, no.
[comms-crew tech 2] Dagger Two is hit.
Dagger Two is hit.
[comms-crew tech] Dagger Two, come in.
Dagger Two, do you copy?
Dagger Two, come in.
You all right?
-Yeah, I'm good, you all right? -[Maverick] Jesus.
Okay.
-What the hell? -What are you doing here?
-What the hell? -What are you doing here? What am I doing here?
You think I took that missile so you could be down here with me?
You should be back on the carrier by now!
I saved your life!
I saved your life, that's the whole point.
-What the hell were you even thinking? -You told me not to think!
Well… [pants]
…it's good to see you.
[sniffs, pants] It's good to see you too.
-So, what's the plan? [pants] -[pants]
You're not serious.
[Rooster] You've got to be shitting me.
An F-14?
I shot down three MiGs in one of those.
We don't even know if that bag of ass can fly.
-Let's find out. -Mav!
Okay.
-[Rooster] There's guys up there, Mav. -Yeah.
-[Rooster] There's more over there. -[Maverick] Okay.
-[Rooster] Let's start running. -[Maverick] Yeah, run, run.
Once… Once I give you the signal for air,
you're gonna flip this switch until the needle gets to 120.
When the engine starts,
you got to pull out the pins and disconnect everything.
-You understand? -Yeah.
Yes!
Once I'm up, stow the ladder.
Okay, wow.
It's been a minute, huh, Mav?
-[device beeping] -[plane engine buzzing]
Oh, my God, this thing is so old.
All right.
-Canopy? -Clear.
Both runways are cratered.
How we gonna get this museum piece in the air?
Why are the wings coming out, Mav?
Mav, this is a taxiway, not a runway.
This is a very short taxiway, Mav.
You just hang on.
Holy shit!
Come on. Needle's alive. Come on.
-Mav? -[Maverick] That's it, come on! Come on!
All right.
-Mav! -[Maverick] Here we go.
[Rooster] Holy shit.
Sir, we're receiving a signal from Rooster's ESAT.
But there seems to be a malfunction.
-Have you lost him? -No, sir. He's supersonic.
He's airborne.
In what?
Sir. Overwatch reports an F-14 Tomcat is airborne and on course for our position.
Can't be. It… It can't be!
Maverick.
Okay, Rooster, get us in touch with the boat.
I'm working on it.
Radio's out, no radar. Everything's dead back here.
-What do I do? Talk me through it. -[Maverick] Okay, first the radio.
Throw the, uh…
the UHF-2 circuit breaker. Try that.
There's 300 breakers back here. Anything more specific?
I don't know. That was your dad's department.
I'll figure it out.
Mav, tally two, five o'clock, low.
What do we do?
Okay, listen. Just be cool.
If they knew who we were, we'd be dead already.
Well, here they come.
-What's your plan? -Just put your mask on.
Remember, we're on the same team.
Just wave and smile.
Just wave and smile.
[Rooster] What's that signal? What's he saying?
[Maverick] Yeah, no idea, I have no idea what he's saying.
[Rooster] What about that one? Any idea? [Maverick] No, never seen that one either.
Oh, shit. His wingman is moving into weapons envelope.
All right, listen up.
When I tell you, you grab those rings above your head.
That's the ejection handle.
[Rooster] Mav, can we outrun these guys?
[Maverick] Not their missiles and guns.
[Rooster] Then it's a dogfight.
[Maverick] An F-14 against fifth-gen fighters?
[Rooster] It's not the plane, it's the pilot.
You'd go after 'em if I wasn't here.
[Maverick] But you are here.
[Rooster] Come on, Mav.
Don't think.
Just do.
[Maverick] Tell me when you see smoke in the air.
[Rooster] Smoke in the air! Smoke in the air! [Maverick] Hang on.
[Rooster] Yeah, Mav! Splash one! Splash one!
-[Rooster] Here comes another one. -[Maverick grunts]
[Maverick] Rooster, flares! Now, now, now!
[Maverick] Splitting the throttles.
-Coming around. -[Rooster grunts]
[Maverick] Give me tone. Give me tone. -[Rooster] You got him, Mav! You got him! -[Maverick] Taking the shot.
-[Rooster] You got him, Mav! You got him! -[Maverick] Taking the shot.
What the…
[Rooster] Holy shit! What the fuck was that?
[Maverick] Hang on. We gotta get low.
The terrain will confuse his targeting system.
[Rooster] Here he comes!
[Maverick] Talk to me, Rooster. Where is he?
[Rooster] He's still on us!
-We took a hit! We took a hit! -[Maverick] Oh, damn it!
[Rooster] Come on, Mav, do some of that pilot shit.
-[Rooster] Holy shit. -[Maverick grunts]
[Maverick] I got tone. Taking the shot.
Damn it! [grunts]
Out of missiles. Switching to guns.
Come on, Mav, come on.
-[Rooster] You got him, Mav! -[Maverick] It's not over yet.
-One last chance. -[Rooster] You can do this.
[Maverick] Come on, Maverick.
[Rooster] Yes! Splash two!
-[Rooster] Mav, I got the radio on. -[Maverick] Outstanding.
-Get us in touch with the boat. -[Rooster] Copy that.
[Maverick] Oh, my God.
[Rooster grunts] Where the hell is this guy?
He's on our nose.
Damn it, we're out of ammo.
Smoke in the air! Rooster, flares!
[Rooster] That was close.
We're out of flares, Mav.
Shit, he's already on us.
[grunts] This is not good.
-[Rooster] We took another hit! -[Maverick] No! No! No! No!
[Rooster groans] We can't take much more of this.
[Maverick] We can't outrun this guy, we got to eject.
-[Rooster] What? -[Maverick] We need altitude.
Pull the ejection handles the second I tell you.
-[Rooster] Mav, wait! -[Maverick] Rooster, there's no other way.
Eject! Eject! Eject!
Rooster, pull the handle! Eject!
[Rooster] It's not working!
[Maverick] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Goose.
[Hangman] Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is your savior speaking.
-Please fasten your seat belts… -[Maverick sighs]
[Hangman] …return your tray tables to their locked and upright positions…
-[Rooster laughs] -[Hangman] …and prepare for landing.
[Rooster] Hey, Hangman, you look good.
[Hangman] I am good, Rooster. I'm very good.
I'll see you back on deck.
[Maverick] Maverick is downwind, no front landing gear.
[Maverick] Maverick is downwind, no front landing gear. No tail hook. Pull the cable and raise the barricade.
-[man] Foul deck! Foul deck! -Raise the barricade!
[Hondo] Go!
[Rooster] Please don't tell me we lost an engine.
[Maverick] All right, I won't tell you that. [Rooster] Okay.
-[Maverick] You good? -[Rooster] Yeah, I'm good.
-Chalked yourself another kill. -That makes two.
Mav has five, makes him an ace.
Captain Mitchell! Captain Mitchell!
Sir!
Thank you for saving my life.
It's what my dad would've done.
Hey, Mav.
Jimmy.
Is…
Is Penny around?
Uh, she took Amelia on a sailing trip.
Did she say when she'd be back?
[Jimmy] You know, she didn't.
-Let it go! -[crew shouting]
Hold on! Hold on!
-[child screaming] -[shrieking]
[Gemma] Dinosaurs are in our world.
And with every confrontation, we learn more about this frightening new reality.
And with every confrontation, we learn more about this frightening new reality. -[tires screeching] -[dinosaur roars]
How did we get here?
-[guests gasp] -[groom] Oh, my God.
[Gemma] It's been three decades since the deadly events at Jurassic Park,
and we've yet to find a way for these animals to live safely among us.
After the devastating eruption of Isla Nublar's long-dormant volcano,
those who survived were transported to the mainland.
Many of the larger predators were captured,
but the remaining creatures scattered here, in Big Rock National Park.
While most remained in the wild, those who made their way to civilization
struggled to adapt to unfamiliar conditions.
Local authorities have warned the animals are unpredictable,
-and when hungry, extremely violent. -[people screaming]
As the dinosaurs spread across borders, a global black market has risen.
-[trafficker] They're not ours. -Go on, you sad, pathetic loser!
[Gemma] To combat the growing threat of illegal poachers,
the US Congress awarded sole collection rights
to the global giant Biosyn Genetics.
At Biosyn, we're dedicated to the idea
that dinosaurs can teach us more about ourselves.
[Gemma] CEO Lewis Dodgson has created a sanctuary in Italy's Dolomite Mountains,
where he hopes to study the dinosaurs' ancient immune systems
for unique pharmaceutical properties.
While Biosyn believes we can handle genetic power responsibly,
the public remains skeptical.
Some note that these government contracts have led
to massive spikes in Biosyn's profits.
And rumors persist of a human clone who mysteriously disappeared,
leading to a worldwide search.
Some believe she's genetically identical to Charlotte Lockwood,
deceased daughter of Jurassic Park co-founder, Benjamin Lockwood.
Now that we brought these animals back from extinction,
can we face the consequences?
Are we responsible for them,
or should they be left to fend for themselves?
As we adapt to an ever-changing world,
we must find the answers to these questions, for their safety as well as for our own.
[Zia] We are inside the illegal breeding facility.
The juveniles are kept in cages to keep costs down.
It's medieval.
Claire.
[Claire] Why do you think he's separated from the rest?
[Zia whispers] I don't think he's gonna make it.
No. What are you doing? We could report this.
The DFW takes days to investigate.
-We can save this one now. -[wails]
[Claire] It's okay. It's okay, buddy.
Okay. Here we go. [grunts]
Nope. No!
-[Zia] Lift. -[Claire] Come on!
-Support the head. -Yeah. -Okay. Yeah. -[alarm blaring]
-[guard 1] Hurry up! -[guard 2] Check the right side.
-[guard 1] Go, go, go. -[growls]
Okay, come on. Come on, let's go.
-Hold on! -To what?
-[bellows] -[Zia] Shit.
Claire, we're gonna get shot!
-No! Claire! No, no, Claire! -Oh, God.
Oh, shit.
Everybody good?
-No! -No!
Okay. Okay, so I think we get this one to the DFW,
Okay. Okay, so I think we get this one to the DFW, and then we hit them again.
Yeah. Yeah, you saw that breeding ground, right?
We're done.
-[sighs] -I got a call last week. It's a real job, something I can do to effectively change things.
It's a real job, something I can do to effectively change things.
-I gotta take it. -They need us.
Are you saving these dinosaurs because they need us,
or are you saving them to absolve yourself?
-[sighs] -[Zia] Claire. I mean, this is crazy.
Claire,
you're doing the right thing.
But this… this isn't the way to go about it anymore.
[Franklin] Honestly, you need someone who's good at being shot at.
Aren't… aren't you and Owen still, like, a weird thing?
-It's not that weird. -He didn't mean "weird."
-Mm-mmm. -No.
Uh, he meant, like, surprising.
Let's bring 'em home! -[whip cracks] -Hyah!
No.
Okay, come here.
Okay. [grunts]
-Hey, hey. -[growls]
We're gonna get you someplace safe.
-Hey. -[growls softly]
There you go.
There you go.
Yeah.
-[dinosaur bellows] -[worker 1] Holy crap.
[worker 2] What in the world, man?
Hey.
Where you been?
No where. What are you burning?
Oh, nothing. Just some old blankets.
You sure you didn't go past the bridge?
That's the look you give me when you think I'm lying.
-Well, are you? -No.
Maisie, you're literally looking everywhere but here.
I said I didn't go past the bridge.
Maisie,
can we start over?
I know, Claire. There are people out there who'll do anything to find me.
I'm not angry.
-That means you don't have to be angry. -I'm not angry.
-I can take care of myself. -Hey.
It's okay for us to depend on each other. That's what people do.
How would I know what people do?
The only people I've spoken to in the past four years are you both.
Besides, I'm not even a real person anyway.
-What? -I was made from someone else.
I'm not me.
You are the only you who ever was.
-What? -N-No.
-Was that, like, really corny? -It was so corny.
-Can we keep that between us? -Can't promise that.
-Hey, kid. -Hello.
Sorry I'm late.
-Aw. -You smell like horses.
-Mmm. -Oh, you like that, do ya?
-I do. Yeah. -Oh.
Okay. Um…
I'm gonna make dinner.
-Everything okay? -[sighs]
-[door closes] -She went into town again.
Ah, this kid. Did you talk to her?
I tried.
-[sighs] -I'll talk to her.
All right. Cut away from yourself.
-Whoo! Stone-cold. -Right?
-[Owen] I would not mess with her. -[chuckles] No way.
Listen, kiddo. We should probably talk about you going into town.
I don't think you understand how bad it is being trapped here.
You're not trapped here. We just don't trust people.
No, you just don't trust me.
And then you expect me to trust you.
-Why can't I have any freedom? -Because you can't.
That went great.
What is happening?
-She's 14. -Yeah.
You remember what that was like.
[Claire] I do.
We can't keep her here forever.
If we don't figure this out, she's gonna go a lot farther than the bridge.
If they find her, we're never gonna see her again.
We gotta protect her. That's our job. That's what we're gonna do.
Protect her how?
By locking her inside?
[Claire] She's got questions.
You know? Questions we can't answer.
She wants to know who she is.
Who Charlotte Lockwood was.
[Rainn] Tracked Grady to his house.
You were right. Raptor's got a juvenile.
But listen, there's something else.
I found that girl you've been after.
Here you go.
Thanks for coming.
Wasn't sure who to call.
Fish and Wildlife didn't even want to see it if it wasn't a dinosaur.
Yeah, well, they get all the attention.
You guys want to vary the sampling plots a hundred yards each?
These your students?
Yeah. We've been looking into the impact of industrial farming on the environment.
So, this is right up our alley.
They hit 60 fields in the county.
You seen anything like this before?
No. Not like this.
They've been leaving degraded fields all across the Midwest.
First these big companies try to kill off all the insects, now this.
Is that your land?
[farmer] That's the Bennetts' corn. The locusts didn't eat that.
You plant the same seed as the Bennetts?
No.
We're independent.
They use Biosyn seed.
Yeah, I bet they do.
You say you caught a live one?
-[student] Hey, Madeline? -[Madeline] Yeah?
[student 2] Okay. Let her down slowly.
-[student 3] Got it? -[student 2] Yeah.
[student 3] Easy.
[student 2] Let's start padding that other side.
[Alan] Why do we dig?
Because paleontology is science, and science is about the truth.
And there is truth in these rocks.
Grant!
You're gonna want to see this.
[female student] Guys, can you help me?
[male student] I'll pack it out. I'll make sure nobody else crosses it.
Ellie Sattler.
Alan Grant.
You look the same.
And this place, it's so…
so, uh… you.
I'm sorry, I… If I'd known you were coming, I would've…
Can I get you something? A beer or…
Um, well, maybe not at 10:00 a.m., but iced tea or--
Tea. Yeah.
Tea. I can do that.
[Ellie] Saw a lot of tourists on the way in.
Well, the funding's dried up, so somebody's gotta pay for all this.
Right. Thank you.
I read your articles about soil science and regenerative farming.
That's great.
Thanks.
Gave me grounds for some hope for a change.
-How are your kids? -Mmm.
Amazing. Grown. It's shocking.
They're both in college. Can you believe that?
And Mark?
It's over.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
It's okay.
I'm back to me.
And my work. You know, it's…
[Alan] That's great.
It's good. It is. I'm alone at last.
[Alan] Exciting times.
Yeah, I'm living the Alan Grant life. It's just…
Yeah, I'm living the Alan Grant life. It's just… -Can be lonely. -…so freeing.
-Can be lonely. -…so freeing.
Ellie. [sighs]
You didn't come out all this way just to catch up now, did you?
That's a locust.
Mandibles, wings, thorax, but…
God, the size of it is massive.
It has genes that have been extinct since the Cretaceous.
And swarms of them are decimating crops from Iowa to Texas.
Terrifying, right?
Started as a few hundred.
There could be millions by the end of the summer.
If they keep going, there'll be no grain to feed chickens, cattle.
The entire food chain would collapse.
Well, it's clearly designed, but why would anyone do that?
None of the crops they're eating are Biosyn seed.
Biosyn.
You're saying Biosyn made this?
I mean, it would not shock me that they wanna control the world's food supply.
Not before a few million starve.
Yeah, what is that saying? How we're three meals away from anarchy?
If we don't stop them, you can pick your last three meals.
So, why are you bringing it to me?
I need concrete evidence Biosyn's responsible for all this.
I need to go to their sanctuary and get DNA from another locust there.
But I need a witness.
Alan.
You command respect. People believe you.
[chuckles] Ellie.
You know why I'm here. It's quiet. I'm done with all that.
Are you? Okay.
[scoffs] Well, I'm sorry, Alan.
Nobody gets that luxury anymore, not even you.
And you know what?
You're the one I trust.
This Biosyn sanctuary is, what, 100 miles from anywhere?
How do you even get in there?
I got an invite from their in-house philosopher.
Seems there's a lot of money in being a chaotician these days.
And he just happened to invite you out of the blue?
He said there were things I'd wanna see.
Uh-huh.
You coming or what?
[guard] It's clear!
[guide] Every animal captured on the mainland comes through here
before shipping out to Biosyn's sanctuary in the Dolomites.
We give them medical attention and make sure they leave healthy.
So much security.
Those are just the ones you see.
A lot of shady types out there want these guys.
-Hey. -Your plane's just fueling up.
Biosyn's a tough invite. You guys must know somebody.
-Do you mind if I… -Of course.
-[growls] -[Ellie] Hello.
You see me? You follow me.
[guide] We rescued these guys from an illegal breeding farm in Nevada a few weeks ago.
Shut the whole place down. Anonymous tip.
[chuckles] Good girl. Yes. Yes.
Alan. You never get used to it.
-[guide] Take care. -[Ellie] Okay, thanks. Bye.
-[snorts] -Hey.
You look just like Blue.
-[baby raptor shrieks] -This?
-You wanna try it? -[sniffs]
Okay.
[Owen] Maisie, don't move.
Hey, girl.
Staying out of trouble?
She had a baby. That's impossible.
-Back up. -[Maisie] She won't hurt us, right?
Oh, you're damn right she will.
Just breathe.
-If you don't, she'll think you're scared. -I am scared.
[Owen] Nah. She doesn't need to know that.
Her nest has got to be nearby. Maisie, get inside.
-I'm coming with you. -What did I just say?
-We gotta move. -[boss] Not yet. We need the girl.
[Claire] Hey, what's up?
Wow.
Maisie?
Maisie?
Where you going?
You can't keep me here. You're not my mother.
She's leaving the house.
[poacher 1] Get in the truck! Come on! Let's go! [poacher 2] Got it!
-Tie it down! -[poacher 2] Hold on.
-Come on. Let's go! -[shrieks]
-Get in! -Come on!
Let's get out of here.
Who are you?
[Owen] Claire!
They found her.
[Claire] What? Who are they?
[Owen] Poachers. I've seen them around.
Leader's a real shit-heel.
He must have recognized me, followed me here.
-Where is she? -Go get the truck.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
-Owen! -Hey. No.
They took her kid too.
I am gonna get her back.
-[growling] -I promise you that.
Come on. I know who to call.
[woman] No, please, please, no!
[sighs] This year, man. What's next?
Historically? Uh, darkness, blood, rain of fire. I think frogs.
We're not gonna be around for much longer anyway.
These locusts in Nebraska are about to wrap it up.
They're eating the corn, wheat.
Basically all of our food and our food's food.
So, we can say goodbye to this.
Hello?
[Claire] Franklin. It's me. You at work?
Okay, you're kind of a subject of interest around here,
so I can't really be talking to you.
Come on. I'm in trouble. I really need your help. Please!
Yeah, and I could lose my job, and you know, I'm not qualified
Yeah, and I could lose my job, and you know, I'm not qualified -to do anything else. -We're outside.
-to do anything else. -We're outside.
[Owen] Let me talk to him.
-That him? -That's him.
Name's Rainn Delacourt. Real piece of work.
What'd he take?
Something we care about very much.
Oh, shit. I told you somebody would come looking for her.
-You can't just take a person, Claire. -We had no choice.
-You can't just take a person, Claire. -We had no choice. Not in the eyes of the law.
This guy is not the law. Tell us how to find him.
Where'd you guys call me from?
We have a man on the inside of Delacourt's operation.
There's an exchange in Malta sometime tomorrow. Cash for cargo.
Was she with him?
There's no mention, but we have people on the ground already.
One of them you know.
A lot of us got recruited by the CIA after the park went down.
Barry's French intelligence now.
I need to talk to him.
You can't just call him. He's deep cover.
Look, once we make the bust in Malta,
our guys will see if Delacourt knows where she is.
Our guys. Not you.
Promise me you won't go in there with your vest and mess everything up.
Why would I do that?
Look, you guys are both crazy,
but you seem like you're good parents, or whatever you're trying to be.
She's lucky to have you.
Don't get killed, okay?
Think we're almost there.
Yeah.
[Ramsay] Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant.
-Ramsay Cole, Communications. -Oh, hey.
Uh, I have to warn you, everyone's so excited to have you.
You guys are absolute legends around here.
Mmm. You must be confusing us with somebody else.
You know, it's great that you guys are still so close with Dr. Malcolm.
I mean, sometimes you meet your heroes and they disappoint you,
but he's exactly the way you'd want him to be.
I mean, such motility of thought. It's incredible.
How much time have you spent with him?
Uh, well, I know that was sarcastic, but honestly, not enough.
-Oh, please. After you. -Oh. And watch your head.
[Ramsay] So, Biosyn bought this land for the amber deposits back in the '90s.
But we've managed to turn it into a safe haven for about 20 displaced species.
First generation came from Sorna. Most of the Nublar dinosaurs are here, too.
Took Fish and Wildlife three years to catch the T. rex.
The T. rex is here?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Arrived just before you guys. [laughs]
[automated voice] Aerial deterrent system, active.
Restricted air space. Protects the airborne life.
Keeps the pterosaurs below 500 feet.
Airborne?
Is that Dreadnoughtus? [gasps] What?
[gasps] What?
[Ramsay] Beautiful, right?
The name means "fear nothing." Well, I guess you know that. [laughs]
-What do they graze on? -[Ramsay] Hawthorn and fern.
All indigenous. Nothing stocked except for the deer population.
It's a great mezzanine species for the apex predator.
The apex predator?
Giganotosaurus.
[Ramsay] At least for now.
Uh, you don't let people in there, right?
Uh, no. Our-Our research… [chuckles]
Our research outposts are connected completely underground.
If we have to, we can just herd the animals remotely
using a neuro-implant that sends electrical signals directly to the brain.
Like shocks?
Uh… n-no, like-like signals.
Doesn't it strike you as a little bit, uh…
-Cruel? -Cruel.
Do you know how much voltage was in the electric fences at Jurassic Park?
Yeah.
[PA announcer] Please join Dr. Ian Malcolm at noon in the lecture hall
for the Ethics of Genetic Power.
God, everyone's so young.
Oh, well, it is part of our ethos to attract the best and brightest.
Doctors.
Respected, renowned Dr. Sattler. Dr. Grant. Hi.
I'm… Well, this is big. I'm-I'm Lewis.
-Dodgson. Yeah. -Hi.
-You're Lewis Dodgson? -I am. How do you do?
We didn't expect to actually see you here. Oh, well, I wouldn't be anywhere else. Would you?
Oh, well, I wouldn't be anywhere else. Would you?
[chuckles] No.
I mean, the people you see here are changing the world.
Would you mind if we, um…
-Ah, just to… It would mean a lot. -Oh.
-[Ellie] Do you wanna, um… -[shutter clicking]
-Oh, great. Thank you so much. -Oh. Ah.
-That-That's good. That's good. Thanks. -[photographer] Okay.
So, you are going to see some remarkable things today.
We are unlocking the true power of the genome.
We're this close. Believe me.
You'll make a fortune with that.
No, it's not about money.
No, we've already identified dozens of applications for paleo-DNA.
We're talking about cancer, Alzheimer's, autoimmune.
We will be saving lives. -But… shh. -Ah.
-But… shh. -Ah.
Um, anyway, I wish I could take you around myself, but, uh, it's, uh…
So, you're in more-than-capable hands with Ramsay.
He's basically a… a young me.
-Only smarter and, uh, taller. -[laughs]
Do you have food?
-Like, one of my bars? -Pardon? Um…
No, never mind. I… I'll find something.
So, uh, I want to do more of this, um, later on, if we, um…
Oh! We booked you a private pod… -Right. -…for the trip out, so.
It's beautiful. You'll love it. Through the caverns and everything.
Now, you better hurry. Malcolm's on. [Lewis] He's a bit of a contrarian, but I like him.
[Lewis] He's a bit of a contrarian, but I like him.
He keeps us on our toes. Anyway.
Thank you for being here. It's…
Okay. Um, follow me, please.
What?
[Ian] Human beings have no more right to safety or liberty
than any other creature on this planet.
We not only lack dominion over nature,
we're subordinate to it.
And now, here we are
with the opportunity to rewrite life at our fingertips.
And just like nuclear power,
nobody knew what to expect with genetic engineering,
but they pressed the button and hoped for the best,
just like you are doing now.
Yep. You.
You control the future of our survival on planet Earth.
According to you, the solution is genetic power.
But that same power could devastate the food supply,
create new diseases, alter the climate even further.
Unforeseen consequences occur.
And every time, every single time…
we all act surprised?
Because deep down,
I don't think that any of us actually believe that these dangers are real.
In order to instigate revolutionary change,
we must transform human consciousness.
[attendee] Yeah!
-Mayam? -[woman] Dr. Malcolm?
-[fans chattering] -Very good. There, there you go.
Hey, I don't want to be rude to my friends. Thank you.
Catch me on my way out. Thanks, everybody.
Look at you,
and look at me, and look at you.
Wha… This is so trippy.
You look like you're doing well.
Well, I got five kids, you know, whom I adore more than life itself, so…
Uh, expenses add up.
You? Alan, are you… are you… You have any family or…
-No. -So, uh, I need to talk to you.
Yeah, I need to talk to you, too. Privately.
Do you two talk a lot?
-Uh, he slid into my DMs. -He did what?
-It's urgent, Ian. -What did you do?
Seven minutes to midnight stuff.
Uh, the Doomsday Clock might be about out of time,
but, as they say, it's always darkest just before eternal nothingness.
What?
[Ellie] Locusts altered with Cretaceous-era DNA.
-[Ian] Yeah, that's not my field. -Yeah, but if these things continue to multiply, we're talking about cascading system-wide effects, Ian.
to multiply, we're talking about cascading system-wide effects, Ian.
Gosh, that's a drag.
-What is the matter with you? -"Drag"?
Why, is there something special you wanted me to do?
-How about give a damn? -You know too much not to care. Hey, I-I gave my opinion robustly for years.
Hey, I-I gave my opinion robustly for years.
As expected, the sum of our human endeavors has led to our annihilation,
and the only play now is to take the time we have left and, uh…
you know, just like we always do, squander it.
Honestly, Ian, that's bullshit.
Can I offer you guys some joe? Uh, Tyler, please, two cappuccinos.
Uh, Tyler, please, two cappuccinos.
I don't want a cappuccino.
Uh, would you like a cortado or, like, macchiato…
Trust me, it's real tough, that jet lag. This is gonna perk you right up.
The locusts are part of a larger project called Hexapod Allies.
-You're right about their intent. -[sighs]
I started hearing rumors six weeks ago.
I read your piece on decadence and put two and two together.
I was not raising my voice. You're beginning to. It's crescendoing, isn't it?
[whispers] They're proliferating wildly.
They're lasting three, four times longer than they should.
And all my models are pointing toward a global ecological collapse, Ian.
Downstairs, sublevel six.
[Ian] That's where they keep the locusts.
Look for a lab marked L4.
But wait, how are we gonna get down there?
Hey, this looks so silky. May I touch this blouse,
-by any chance? -Sure.
You know what it is? Don't tell me. Don't tell me. This is…
-You won't know it. -…sustainable bamboo.
-It is sustainable bamboo. -That's why I said--
-How'd you know that? Yeah. -I just know it.
-It's amazing. -[Tyler] I've got cumin.
-Very amazing. -I've got cinnamon.
I've got all spice, which is not very popular.
-I've got five-spice, um… -Doctor.
…if you're into that kind of feel.
-Um, and let's talk milks. -Yeah.
[Tyler] Okay, soy milk, yes?
-[Tyler] No. -What just happened?
We're in.
[automated voice] Sublevel six. Restricted.
[Henry] Lewis, you're not listening to me.
The locusts' prehistoric DNA has made them stronger than they should be.
They're multiplying like crazy and they're not dying.
-What part of this don't you understand? -Oh, I do understand.
This is gonna be a global famine.
Hey, hey, we can't anticipate everything.
We need to eradicate the ones we released.
-What? -All of them.
-No. No. -Like--
-Henry, we don't want to cause a panic. -Like yesterday.
We want control.
There's no such thing.
When we're afraid,
what do we do?
What have we done before?
We follow through.
That's what we do.
Right?
Right.
We found the girl.
She's en route.
-Cost me a fortune. -What?
-Wait, you found her? -Yeah, found them both.
Her and the little raptor.
Blue reproduced all on her own, just like you said.
You're so smart, Henry.
That's why this works.
You understand the value of these creatures.
You always have. I do, too.
We don't stop because of a… What, little side project went south?
Hey, if they trace the locusts back to us,
they come for the dinosaurs.
All your work, gone.
Billions of dollars in assets, gone.
Diamonds with no one to mine them.
You really think she's the solution?
Okay.
Everything involving the girl goes through me, right?
Is she alright?
She better be.
She's the most valuable intellectual property on the planet.
I said I'd call you.
[Lewis] They land yet?
[Soyona] Second plane is incoming.
-Who said anything about a second plane? -We flew them separately.
I'm not taking any chances.
And we'll need payment before delivery.
I didn't like what happened last time.
Okay. Okay, just… call me when it's done.
You said I was going someplace safe.
You are.
[Carolyn] Walk to the car.
No.
It's not a choice.
[smuggler] Fifty grand to fly one little raptor. Not bad.
What's with the girl?
-Not your problem. -[zipper closes]
Pleasure doing business.
[guard] We're ready. Let's go.
[Barry] Owen.
-Hi, Claire. -Um.
I thought you would've chosen a quieter line of work.
I tried. My cousin and I opened a cafe. I lasted three weeks.
The way the world is headed, it's hard to look away.
[Barry] Delacourt was hired by Soyona Santos,
a broker in the underground dinosaur trade.
We don't have intel on his cargo,
but once they make the exchange, we'll see what they know about your girl.
You can listen in, but promise me you will not make contact.
No.
[Barry] There is a big underground market for dinosaurs now.
Europe, Middle East, northern Africa, it all comes through here.
Don't look at anyone, don't talk to anyone.
Just try to blend in.
[man] You're still flying for Santos, huh?
You must need money.
What's it to you?
I've got cargo.
A thousand kilos of dinosaur to Palermo.
I give you 2,000.
Two thousands? How much is there?
[Kayla] Are you lost?
You're American.
And that make us friends?
-Listen, I just got here and-- -Oh, no.
That was not an invitation. Here.
Souvenir.
Go back to the hotel, you know, throw some bath salts in a bath.
This place, not your vibe.
[Claire] Wait.
-Look. -Claire.
Claire.
I know this must feel exotic,
but if you mess with the wrong person down here, you disappear.
You feel me?
Good luck, okay?
Wait.
-Wait. -What is this?
-I need your help. -I don't know you.
-I'm looking for someone. -Don't do that.
She is all alone. Please.
-That your daughter? -Yes.
Sorry, I can't get involved.
-[Owen] Think I got him. -Target on the move.
[Barry] That's our undercover agent with him.
Claire, he's headed underground.
-[Owen] You see him? -Yeah, I've got him.
Alright, let's go.
[agent 1] Team four, need you to sweep spreading south.
[agent 2] All units, take up bull's-eye position.
[sniper] This is Bravo One.
Primary target in sight. No sign of the girl.
[agent 1] Alpha team, stand clear.
My people say the raptor arrived in good condition.
You boys didn't cock this up.
Color me amazed.
I do have another job for you. Short hop, money's double.
What's the cargo?
Atrociraptors.
Thoroughbreds.
Trained to kill.
-Kill who? -Whoever they're told.
Laser marks the target, they attach to the scent, don't stop till it's dead.
[Soyona] Inescapable.
Those idiots making hybrids had it all wrong.
You can't engineer loyalty. You have to nurture it.
Fifty thousand to fly them to Riyadh.
In or out?
[whispers] She's not here.
Where are we going?
[driver] Almost there.
-[agent 3] That's the drop, let's go! -[agent 4] Need eyes on…
[agent 5] Weapons down! Eyes on them!
-Hands in the air! -Contact made!
[agent 5] Delacourt, on the floor now!
Get on the ground!
[agent 5] Delacourt! Stay with him!
-Shit. -[men shouting]
-[gunfire] -[Claire screams] [man] Get that truck out of here!
[agent] There goes Santos!
[agent 3] Damn, we lost Delacourt.
This is Bravo One. Truck is approaching the underpass.
[agent 1] Go.
The girl, where is she? Where did they take her?
-Get it off! -Where is she?
I don't know! We handed her off to Santos.
I don't know where they took her after that.
Claire, it's Santos, the woman in white.
I'll find her.
-[agent] Hey, hey! Hey! -Hold it!
-Let them out. -What?
You heard me.
-[agents screaming] -[growling]
[Owen] Claire, do you have her?
-We had some trouble. -What kind?
[Soyona] The parents, Grady and Dearing. They're here.
-Can you take care of it? -Not for free.
[scoffs] Well, do it.
-[tracker buzzing] -Okay, okay. Listen.
Oh! No, no, no!
You don't use it on people.
Where's my daughter?
She wasn't yours to begin with.
-[electricity crackling] -Tell me.
Biosyn.
[Soyona] They're taking her to Biosyn.
You missed her.
She's gone.
Take my hand. Come on.
Hold on tight.
What?
Do you remember how we used to get the raptors in the truck?
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-You're up. -No.
-[growling] -At the last minute, dive roll.
-I don't dive roll. -You'll be fine.
I never got the timing right.
-Now? -Any minute. Any minute now.
-Now? -No.
Now! -[roaring] -[grunting]
-Yeah. -Yeah, yeah!
Freeze!
I'm flying us out of here. Tell me where you wanna be dropped.
You ever flown to Biosyn?
[Claire] Owen! They took her to Biosyn.
There's an airfield -on the north side of the island. -Go.
-on the north side of the island. -Go.
You're under arrest. Stay where you are.
-Right! -[grunts]
Heads up!
We made a lot of enemies, so we gotta go.
-He'll be here. -Uh-huh.
Out of time, out of time.
There he is.
-Pull over. -That's not how planes work.
Open the back.
Come on!
Hold on tight!
Oh, sh--
Still got it.
Kayla Watts.
You're welcome.
You don't look like you fly for Biosyn.
I'm gonna take that the way you meant it and not the way it sounded.
I fly for whoever got a bag, but we'll call this one a favor.
Those don't work. They broke.
I'll take you all to Biosyn, but I can't promise it won't be dangerous.
You're willing to risk your life for people you never met?
You wanna ask questions, or you want a ride?
We'll take the ride.
[Ramsay] So this is our habitat development lab.
A lot of exciting discoveries as of late.
We've brought back numerous species in their purest form,
and I mean complete, untouched genomes, like Moros intrepidus.
-What? -Yeah.
[gasps] Wow.
What about splicing DNA?
You know, creating new species.
Oh, no, Dr. Sattler, we don't do that here.
We like to think we're more evolved.
Okay. Looks like we still have some time left before your ride.
Uh, would you guys like to tour the facilities yourselves?
Oh, uh, I mean, we could.
-Yeah, why not? -[Ramsay] Great.
I'll meet you guys at the hyperloop, station three in about 30 minutes.
Elevators are down this hall, not those.
Those lead you down to the sublevels.
You need special clearance to get down there.
-Oh, okay. -Thirty minutes.
Here. Take this.
Okay?
Yep.
I'm really sorry that it had to happen this way.
Yep, that's what kidnappers say.
Claire should never have hidden you away.
You're way too important, Maisie.
[Maisie] You took her too?
Yeah.
We needed her to help us understand you.
[Maisie] Hey, Beta.
You okay?
Did you say "Beta"? Is that her name?
I gave it to her.
[Henry] Beta is pretty special.
You know, when we made Blue,
we used monitor lizard DNA to fill in the gaps in her genome.
Monitor lizards can reproduce without a mate.
So Beta and Blue are genetically identical,
and that's what they have in common with you and--
Charlotte.
What do you know about Charlotte?
She died.
A long time ago.
It broke my grandpa's heart.
So he made me.
No, Maisie. Actually, he didn't.
Charlotte made you.
I'm so excited for everyone to see what we've been doing here.
There's new technology being made, new science, like, every day almost.
And it's great to be… it's great to be in the center of… center of that.
[Henry] Charlotte lived on Site B with all of us till the storm.
She loved dinosaurs.
-[Henry] Charlotte, be careful. -Yeah, I will.
[Henry] She grew up around scientists.
And eventually…
…she became one herself.
A butterfly flew into my office this morning.
They say tiny things have huge impacts, and I agree wholeheartedly.
She was brilliant.
For all my work with creatures, wings flapping…
In ways that I'll never be.
In the metaphysics of identity, can a replica truly be the original?
And if it's possible, what makes it so?
I've lost my pen.
Is that me?
Yeah. [chuckles]
Just like Blue, Charlotte was able to have a child all by herself.
She created you with her own DNA.
So I do have a mother.
Your grandfather didn't want anyone to know the truth.
He was protecting her, and you.
And we're the same?
You were.
When you were a baby, Charlotte started to show symptoms of a genetic disorder.
That's how she died.
She didn't know she had it until after you were born.
-Do I have it too? -No.
She changed your DNA.
[Henry] She altered every cell in your body to eradicate this disease.
No one on earth has ever known how to do that.
She fixed me.
[Henry] Charlotte's discovery is a part of you now.
Your DNA could change the world.
And I have to know how she did it, but I just can't replicate her work.
If I could just study you and Beta, whose DNA was never changed, I could…
fix a terrible mistake that I've made.
What kind of mistake?
[automated voice] Sublevel six. Restricted.
Thanks for coming.
-[Alan] Which lab did Malcolm say? -L4.
[Ellie] This is it.
[Ellie] Okay. Get in, get the sample and get out.
And move slow.
They can swarm at the slightest disturbance.
[Ellie] Orthoptera.
Two weeks.
Fully mature. This one.
[exhales deeply] Ready? Easy.
Okay. Go.
What?
Go get it.
Is that necessary?
Wh-What did you think was gonna happen?
I have to take a sample. We need concrete evidence. This is it.
Alan, you said there was no time. Can you get it?
Of course I can get it.
Okay. Easy.
[Ellie] Watch its legs.
[Ellie] Here we go.
They're cell signaling between them. This is not good, Ellie.
I almost got it.
How does she remain an asset, Henry, if you're incriminating both of us
by showing her classified things on the computer?
[Henry] Charlotte Lockwood believed the methods used at Jurassic Park could cure disease.
She was right.
Having filled the gaps in Maisie's genome with altered DNA,
she used a pathogen to deliver the repaired sequence to every cell.
If I can repurpose what she did, I could change the locust DNA,
eradicating them in a single generation.
Maisie and the baby raptor will provide the missing data.
Hey, do you wanna get out of here?
-[Beta shrieks] -What the--
-[alarm blaring] -Got it.
-[Ellie] Oh, my God! -[screaming continues]
They're everywhere! Help me!
Oh, God! No!
[screaming] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Maisie.
[automated voice] Asset containment breach. Please remain at your stations.
Asset containment breach. Please remain at your stations.
[Ellie] Oh, my God.
-Oh, God. I can't see! -[Alan] Where's the key?
Oh, God!
You okay?
Yeah. You?
Yeah.
You're Dr. Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant.
You were at Jurassic Park.
Wh… What are you doing here?
What? What…
What are you doing here?
I'm Maisie Lockwood.
Uh, hey, we don't, uh…
We're not… We don't work for Biosyn.
I can tell.
-We gotta get out of here. -Yeah, we should go.
Okay. In and out. We find your girl and go.
Tower, this is N141. Request to land for freight delivery. Over.
[Denise] N141, negative.
We've been advised you're carrying unauthorized passengers. Over.
[Kayla] Copy that, Tower. Be advised shipment is perishable.
We need immediate clearance. It's an emergency. Over.
There isn't… No.
Uh, negative. Return to point of origin.
Uh, you seem to be breaking up. Are you hearing me on your side?
[distorted] May need to check systems.
Nice try, Kayla. They will down your bird.
Who is this? Is this Denise?
You do not want me to start spilling secrets, Denise. You remember Dubrovnik.
She's…
Different Denise, in accounts.
Talked to Santos. It's the girl's parents.
Let's shut off the ADS.
Are you sure?
Uh-huh.
What's that? Uh…
That's the, uh-- That's the Aerial Deterrent System.
-[Kayla] Keeps the airborne life away. -Why is it blinking?
Because Deadass Denise in the tower just turned it off.
[Kayla] We gotta get out of this airspace right now. -[dinosaur shrieking] -[gasps]
-That's another plane, right? -Not exactly.
-[Claire] Is that a… -Quetzalcoatlus.
Late Cretaceous, should have stayed there.
Okay. Okay.
It's cool. We're good. It's gone.
[Kayla] This plane is going down!
If you're gonna eject, you need to do it now!
-I only got one chair, and she's in it. -You don't have parachutes?
I wasn't expecting company!
Claire! We gotta get you off this plane.
What?
The parachute is gonna open automatically.
If it doesn't, you pull this lever. Do you understand me?
Claire! If it doesn't open automatically,
you're gonna pull this lever behind you. Okay?
Ten thousand feet!
Hey, you're the one who's gotta go to get to her.
You're her mom. You're her only shot.
I'll see you again.
I love you.
What's the plan?
Whatever happens. That's the plan.
-Three. -This way.
-[Ellie] Alan, we need the code. -Let's try this thing.
Yeah.
-[Ellie gasps] Get down. -[door opens]
-[sighs] -[Alan chuckles]
-Thank God, it's you! -I know.
-This place is such a maze. -It's good you're here.
We were so confused. I thought we were straight up lost.
Then you said station three. And I was like, here--
Do you have the sample?
-What? -What are you talking about?
The DNA sample. Do you have it?
Biosyn's responsible for the locust epidemic.
Dodgson's covering it up. You were right. I'm here to help you.
I'm here to help you.
Do you have it?
Yeah.
Good.
This pod will take you straight to the airfield.
We have a plane ready to fly.
-Ian told you about Hexapod Allies? -No.
I told him.
What?
-Okay. You guys gotta go. -[Alan] Wait.
Maisie.
Maisie Lockwood.
Go.
Okay.
[Kayla] That was my baby.
Okay, okay.
[Owen] Where'd you learn to fly?
Uh, Air Force. Legacy on my mama's side.
Yeah. I'm Navy.
Okay, so how'd you end up doing this?
I was a legit contract pilot for a grip,
but it didn't exactly pay enough to be out here sending money home.
So I hit up a few contacts for the more lucrative shady shit.
Honestly, I might be done with this line of work.
Is that why you're helping us?
I was there when they handed your girl off to Biosyn.
I could have said something, but I didn't.
And when I saw her picture…
It isn't enough to do nothing.
Thank you.
[Kayla] No.
Nope.
[Owen] What an asshole.
You good?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm not shook at all. You?
Nah. Nah, no.
[Kayla] Ejection seat beacon. We'll find her.
-[beeping] -Okay, okay.
You really love her, huh?
Yeah.
I get it.
I like redheads too.
What? God.
-Who is that? -[Rainn] It's Grant and Sattler.
-Is this live? -Twelve minutes ago.
We were tracking the escaped asset. My guys missed it.
[Rainn] They stole a DNA sample.
How'd they get in there?
They used an access key. Yankee White clearance.
One of our cameras saw Ian Malcolm put something in Sattler's pocket.
[sighs] Alright. I want to see him.
And get Ramsay up here too, will you?
-Where are they now? -[Rainn] On the way to the airfield.
They caught the hyperloop right on schedule.
How are you?
-[Alan] You alright? -[chuckles]
Not really, no.
Hey.
I, uh, knew your mom.
You did?
Yeah, a few years after Hammond died,
she came to my university to lecture,
and we became good friends.
What was she like?
[Ellie] Brilliant.
Light-years ahead of everybody else. [chuckles]
And she had a conscience.
While they were out building theme parks,
well, she was determined to prove that genetic power could save lives.
And I was her experiment.
No.
She wanted a child more than anything.
[Ellie] But she wanted you to have what she couldn't.
A full life.
I didn't know her long,
but I know she loved you very much.
[Maisie] What's happening?
[Alan] This must be the old amber mines.
They must've made access doors when they built these tunnels.
Hey, I heard the alarm. Everything alright?
Yeah. No, no. Nothing we can't, uh, handle. Listen--
-You rang? -Oh, good.
Dr. Malcolm, you are…
fired. What?
It was such a cushy gig.
You can, uh, give your access key to security if you still have it.
One of the hyperloop pods just shut down in the amber mines.
[Lewis] What?
Wow. This day.
Uh, which… Which pod are we…
Are there, um…
dinosaurs in the mines?
There are dinosaurs everywhere.
I mean, yeah, technically birds are dinosaurs, g-genetically speaking at least.
Okay. Lewis, Grant and Sattler are in this pod.
We need to send a security team -out there ASAP. -Okay. Absolutely, Ramsay. Thank you.
Let's all just stay in our lanes though. We can take care of it.
Thank you, Doctor.
That's it, huh? Nothing else to see here?
Uh, I'm not sure I admire your tone right now.
-You need to leave. -[Ian] Yeah, I do.
But first, I owe all these folks an apology.
I think that by lending my cachet to this joint,
I might've made it seem as if Biosyn wasn't rotten to the core.
That's enough, Ian.
See, here's how they get you.
They give you so many promotions in a short period of time
that it bludgeons your capacity for critical thinking.
Oh, my God.
Then there are doors that you don't open, things that you ignore.
But mainly, he's exploiting your enchantment with these.
Is there an actual concern here, or are you just--
You're racing toward the extinction of our species, and you don't care.
You know exactly what you're doing, but you won't stop.
You can't.
You know, I thought you might be different but you're just like everyone else.
You see what you wanna see.
You imagine unchecked avarice, so that's what you find.
You envision, what, an evil, unbound Prometheus,
-so that's what I am to you? -Prometheus got gored.
So will you, you rapacious rat bastard.
Ramsay, will you help Dr. Malcolm gather his things?
His room, and then to the airfield. That's it.
Dodgson.
Allosaurus?
Giganotosaurus.
Largest known terrestrial carnivore.
[Kayla] He put two apex predators in one valley.
Pretty soon there's only gonna be one.
[Ellie gasps] Did you feel that?
That's an air current.
Must be an opening up ahead.
[Alan] How old is this mine, do you think?
[Ellie] Just breathe.
Nobody panic. Just watch out for bats.
-Who said anything about bats? -[Maisie] I hate bats.
Well, there's probably no bats. No falling rocks.
Just a possibility of toxic gas, dehydration, hypothermia.
Just possibilities, nothing for certain.
I should've left you where you were. Why did I bring you into this?
-You were happy in your element. -What? What? -[Alan] Ellie. -What?
I wasn't happy.
You weren't?
-[Maisie] Do you guys have kids? -What?
Uh… no. I-I do. Two.
But not with him?
Uh… no.
No, just old friends.
Uh, just old friends.
Really?
[Ramsay] Won't be long before security knows you're gone.
Oh, map. That looks like an old map. You don't have a new map?
There's an access gate at the northeast corner of the mine.
-If your friends make it out-- -If?
-When they make it out. -Yes, sir.
That's where they'll be.
[Ian] These roads are protected, right?
Uh, yeah, I'd drive fast.
You did good.
Uh, yeah. Well, actually, it's a complete disaster, but thanks.
Not yet.
[Ellie] Watch yourself.
-Ellie? -Yeah.
What was that?
Be careful.
-[Maisie] Oh, my God. -Are you okay?
Forget the hat!
-[grunts] -Come on!
[Ellie] Go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Button…
[Alan] It's a car.
-Oh, my God. Ian! -Ian, over here!
[Ellie] Quick, Ian!
-[Alan] Open the gate! -Please help us!
-Do you know the code? -I didn't know there was gonna be a code.
-I didn't know there was gonna be a code. -[roars]
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
The brake! Pull the brake!
There are 10,000 possibilities.
Push your legs against it!
-[Ian] 1984. -[Alan] Come on, Ian!
-[Ellie] Kick up against it! -Hurry!
Miles Davis's birthday, 0526. -[growling] -[all screaming]
-[Alan] Ian! -Please. Please.
-Do something! -[Ellie] We're not gonna make it.
Let's-Let's all try to stay positive.
-Please! -I know. I know. I know!
[Ellie] Oh, my God!
[Ian] What do you know? It actually worked.
-[Ellie] Ian, this is Maisie. -[Ian] Hi, Maisie.
[Ellie] We got the DNA.
-[Alan] We need to get out of this valley. -Yeah.
-[Alan] Come on. Come on. -[Ellie] Let's go. Let's go.
Come on. Come on.
Go on. Get!
Yuck.
-[Claire sobs] -Hey.
I thought you were dead.
What do they even eat?
We better get inside.
Go ahead.
[automated voice] Containment chamber compromised.
It's locked.
Gonna need something heavy, something sharp, or both.
That can't be right.
-Is that… -Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
He's burning the evidence.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my-- -That's bananas.
[gasps] Oh, my God.
I-I… I know that this may seem precarious, but…
No, we're teetering.
Shouldn't we all lean to the left or something?
That's a very constructive… Thank you, Maisie.
Yeah.
Slow. Slow.
Slow.
-Okay. -[gasps]
-We're fine. See this? -Mm-hmm.
-This is fine. -Mm-hmm.
-[Ellie] Alan? Alan! -[Alan groans]
How is everybody?
[gasps] It's my parents.
Help!
-Help! -[pounding] Listen.
[Maisie] Help!
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
[Claire] You're okay.
You're okay.
You came to get me. You actually… You came to get me.
-Of course, we did, sweetheart. -[panting]
-Hey. -Of course.
I remember you.
Remember you too.
They helped me escape.
Yeah?
You okay?
-Thank you. -Yeah.
We gotta go.
Gonna have to break a window to get inside that thing.
Hope nobody is afraid of heights. -[heavy footsteps approaching] -[Ellie gasps]
-Don't move. -Don't move.
What is that?
Giganotosaurus.
Biggest carnivore the world has ever seen.
[whispers] Maisie, Maisie. Look at me.
-Go, go, go. -Come on!
No! No, no, no.
-Hustle! -I'm gonna die!
-Climb! Climb, kid! -[sobs]
No, you're not. No, you're not. You're okay.
Go, go, go, go, go.
Come on.
-Hey! -[growls]
Oh, yeah. Come here.
Help me open it.
I got ya.
[Kayla] Go, go, go.
[Ellie] Go, go, go, go, go!
Run!
See? Not so bad.
Come on.
Call an evacuation. We need to bring the animals inside.
The regulations are clear -that in the event of a level two-- -Shh!
Jeffrey.
God…
Damn it!
Just…
-Just call it. -[alarm blaring]
Attention, attention. This is an immediate evacuation order.
Remote herding system is now active.
All living assets en route to emergency containment.
I can't get hold of anybody since everything is, uh, on fire.
-Dr. Sattler, get some water. -Oh, thanks.
Dr. Grant? Here you are.
I'm, uh, I'm Owen Grady. Big fan. I read your book.
Well, book on tape.
Owen Grady. Owen Grady. Yeah, I know who you are.
You trained raptors.
[chuckles] Yeah. I tried. Yeah.
How you doing? -The one here. -Ooh.
You were, you were at Jurassic World.
Jurassic World? Not a fan. Mm-mmm.
Okay. So, we good to find a way out of here?
-Yep. -[Kayla] Let's get it.
There's a helicopter out in the main complex.
We turn the ADS back on, we go home.
-[Ellie] Wait. What's an ADS? -Aerial Deterrent System.
You know? For the pterodactyls and shit.
Keeps them away from the helicopters.
Well, how do we turn it back on?
Okay. It looks like all the systems run through to the control room,
which is on the third floor.
These outposts are all connected underground.
Alright. Easy, Rambo.
[Ian] So you worked in the raptor pen, huh?
[Owen] Yeah.
Wow. And what… what happens?
Do you just tell them what to do and they, uh, they comply? Or…
Well, it's a human-animal bond based on mutual respect.
I had a dog once.
Humped my leg so much I… I got a callus on my shinbone.
That's a true story, huh.
Oh, God. Hey. Good.
Here's what I'm thinking. We get started again.
You and me. I can get money.
Yeah. Money's cheap these days.
Wh-What's the matter? Don't look so worried. There's--
There's opportunity in-in everything. E-Even this. You-You'll learn that.
I've been thinking, um, maybe you take more of a lead now. Okay?
You're ready, I think.
Here, take…
What the hell is the matter with you?
It was you.
You told Malcolm about the program. You, you…
You set this whole thing up. You set me up.
I gave you every opportunity I did not have. I…
We have an understanding, Ramsay. And you do not break that.
I would not break this.
I'm not you.
This is very bad.
This is the same system we used at the park.
Great. So we can, uh, turn on the… the thing and then we all get out of here?
-Let's see. ADS… -[keyboard clacks]
What's this? What-What's "Error 99"?
[Ramsay] Not enough power.
In a breakdown, all available power is seized
by the primary system to keep running.
We need all that power to reactivate the ADS.
So the system's safety feature is what's gonna kill us?
[scoffs] Of course.
-How do we get more power? -Ah, well, we can't.
But we can redistribute what we have.
-Um, we just need to… -Shut down the primary system.
-Yes. Exactly. -Where is it?
-Uh, next floor up. -I'm coming with you.
[Maisie] We escaped down here.
-Where is that? Water treatment center? -Hydroelectric system. Sub eight.
-Give me eight minutes. I could find her. -Wait. Who's this now?
Beta. Blue's baby.
Velociraptor.
-What? -A baby raptor?
And you gave her a name. How about that?
I made a promise, we would bring her home.
You made a promise to a dinosaur.
You're coming with us, right?
[chuckles] Maisie, I…
Please.
-I'll be on channel five. -Okay.
-We're on three. -[sighs]
-Come back. -I always come back.
I'll have that chopper hot in ten. Wait for my signal.
[automated voice] Evacuation phase four complete. All living assets now in containment.
Come on.
[Claire] Still get nightmares?
All the time.
You?
I have a lot of regrets.
Oh, yeah?
Well,
we hold on to regret, we stay in the past.
What matters, I guess, is…
is what we do now.
-Right? -Yeah.
[Claire whispers] Okay.
[Claire] Nobody said there'd be bugs.
[Maisie] B4. She's in here.
[Alan] Watch the sides. They always come from the sides.
You know, at first we thought they disembowel their prey, but no.
They're smart enough to go straight for the throat.
The veins, the arteries.
Sometimes both at the same time.
[Maisie] Okay.
[Ellie] Okay.
[Ian] We've got you. It's right down that aisle. -It's right down that aisle where you are. -[Ellie breathes shakily]
Why are they skulking in, and…
You can sprint right for it.
Okay. Here it is.
Okay, so it-it'll be a yellow button on a grid of six.
[Ian] There's a green button. Do you see a green button?
It's not that green button. It's four…
-Four from the bottom. Above this-- -Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Fourth one up?
Third one down or fourth one up. Same thing.
Ian, be specific.
[Owen] She was here.
Lights off.
I don't know how I could possibly be more specific
other than to say that the one you want is marked with
-"E1." E1. -E1.
-[sighs, chuckles] -E1.
-[powering down] -Yeah.
[Lewis] No. No, no, no, no.
[Owen] Damn it. She's fast.
Hey!
Eyes on me.
[Owen] I've got to hit her on the side of her neck.
Maisie, you're gonna hold her focus.
Grant,
we're triangulating.
Go.
[Owen] Sorry, girl.
I promised your mom I'd get you home.
[automated voice] Primary system rebooting.
Wait. Oh, no, no, no.
-No, no, no. -It's rebooting.
No, it shouldn't be doing that.
Here, take this.
-You're gonna stay on it. -[Ellie] Ian, shut it down!
We-We're gonna make it work. We're gonna figure this out. It's very complex.
We don't have time for complex!
[automated voice] Primary system compromised.
[Ian] Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[automated voice] Aerial Deterrent System active.
Victory. Victory.
Damn, that felt good.
Oh! Come on!
What's your story?
Wait!
[Lewis on PA] At Biosyn, we're dedicated to the idea
that dinosaurs can teach us more about ourselves.
[Claire] Alright, Kayla. We're good to go.
Okay, cutie.
[Alan] You alright?
-Someday. -Okay.
-Hey. -[gun cocks]
I remember you.
Please. You have to listen to me.
You created an ecological disaster.
And I can fix it.
Charlotte Lockwood changed every cell in Maisie's body.
It saved her life.
If I can understand how Charlotte rewrote Maisie's DNA,
I can spread change from one locust to the entire swarm.
Before it's too late.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's what she would've wanted.
Thank you.
[Ian] No, no, no.
[Ian] No, no, no, no, no.
Him?
Not him. Not him. It's always him.
Every si…
Is that a dinosaur on your shoulder?
Yeah. Why?
[Kayla] I have air. Meet me at the center.
No, no. Wait, wait, wait. Hey, hey. Do… Do not land in here.
I don't have a choice, dude. The valley isn't safe.
No, they're not in the valley anymore!
This isn't about us.
[Ellie] Come on!
Oh, my God! Get him up! Come on, come on, come one!
[Ian] Come on.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[Ellie] Come on!
Ellie, no!
Come on, Maisie! Go!
Ramsay, get in.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Everybody hold on to somebody.
No, at every level.
Complete systemic corruption in the executive ranks.
"Systemic corruption." You get that? Write that down.
[Kayla] Yeah, it's crazy.
Oh, and then, and then we crashed into this ice lake, right?
I mean, they literally owe me a plane.
I need to get this sample vetted at the lab
before I take it to my contact at The Times.
You could, uh, come with me.
Unless you need to get back to your dig.
-Ellie? -Yeah?
I am coming with you.
I know. One more minute, then we'll send you home with your folks.
[Gemma] Today marks the first day of testimony from Biosyn whistleblower Ramsay Cole.
The Senate will also hear from Doctors Grant, Sattler and Malcolm,
who have been vocal in this debate since the incident at Jurassic Park.
[Ellie] You look…
-Uncomfortable. -…trustworthy.
Yeah, not getting used to it.
Let's finish this.
Yeah.
[Gemma] Dr. Henry Wu has found an emergency solution to the ecological crisis.
His use of a pathogen to alter the locusts' DNA
has revolutionized modern genetics.
He attributed the discovery to another scientist, Charlotte Lockwood,
who died nearly 13 years ago.
By UN decree, Biosyn valley has been designated a global sanctuary.
The animals will live there free, safe from the outside world.
-Money? -Money.
Life on Earth has existed for hundreds of millions of years.
And dinosaurs were only a part of that.
And we're an even smaller part of that.
They really put us in perspective.
[Charlotte] The idea that life on Earth existed 65 million years ago…
it's humbling.
We act like we're alone here, but we're not.
We're part of a fragile system made up of all living things.
If we're going to survive, we'll have to trust each other.
Signore, welcome to Venice.
-Thank you. -Prego.
It feels good to be back.
[Cyrus] How we doing, team?
The champagne's on ice, so let's wrap this up.
[Cyrus] Ah, no, grazie.
[chuckles] Oh, you must. You know, they're quite exquisite.
No, thank you.
-[Cyrus] How does it feel in the hall? -Nineteen million!
-[whispering] Rich. -[Cyrus] My favorite feeling.
[auctioneer] Nineteen million in London.
Going once.
Going twice.
-[gavel bangs] -[auctioneer] Sold!
[auctioneer] Thank you. Thank you.
Please, let's now turn our attention to the next item.
Item number 235 is a painting by Kehinde Wiley
titled The Prelude.
Do I have seven million?
[softly] In position, London?
[Luke] Checking in from the Thames.
Just taking position near the drop site now.
[Magnus] Are you part of Uber Boats now?
[Luke] Stay focused, mate.
[auctioneer] Going once.
All right, then. Let's show them what true artistry looks like.
Sold for 11 million to Mr. Mollsen in Venice.
Ah great. Tech boy's got a new toy.
[auctioneer on TV] The Kehinde Wiley sets another record
joining the Hirst and the Franz Marc.
Ross!
[in Italian] Police. Cultural Heritage Unit.
[on earpiece] Stefano, are you there?
Yes, we're here.
[in English] Local police are in position.
If Cyrus tries to swipe anything, he's in for a surprise.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to introduce you to N8. -[upbeat hip-hop music playing] -[crowd applauds and cheers]
[auctioneer] As you know, the digital artist has remained anonymous throughout his career.
But today he's here to auction off a single-edition NFT…
There he is, among the bidders.
[Ross] He's not even wearing a mask.
He's like, "Here I am."
What's it gonna be, Cyrus?
The Wiley's too hard to transport, the Warhols are a little tired.
At least we know he won't lift the NFT.
Nothing to lift.
And now, it's my honor to present Self Importrait by N8.
[auctioneer] Comprised of 482 cameras,
this mask will create the NFT.
Inspired by Vincent van Gogh,
the digital art piece will be generated from a live 30-second feed.
Once complete, the NFT will have captured the moment of its sale,
which will include the buyer.
Do we have an opening bid?
Twelve million.
-What? -[crowd murmuring]
Quick. Look up paddle 1305.
Uh, registered to John Bratby.
Shit. He knows we're here.
How'd you know?
John Bratby, British, mid-century, painted scenes of domestic life.
-And that gives us away, uh, how? -[sighs]
I'm living in his old studio.
[auctioneer] Twelve million.
Twelve million is the standing bid.
Thirteen million in London.
-Fifteen. We have 15 here in Venice. -[crowd gasps]
-16.5. -[auctioneer] 16.5.
Seventeen million.
Seventeen and a half.
[auctioneer] Welcome to the bidding, Mr. Sage.
-Eighteen million! -[stunned chatter]
Nineteen.
Twenty million.
Twenty million dollars in Venice.
[auctioneer] Going once.
Going twice.
Ready?
[Mi-Sun] Ready.
Sold.
-Lift. -[device beeps]
He's making a move. We need to go in. Go!
[in Italian] Go, go!
[on earpiece] Stefano, let's go!
[recording on PA in English] Leave immediately by the nearest exit.
-[chimes] -[Magnus] Thank you, Stewart.
N8, I'm so sorry for the confusion, sir. I can escort you out.
Hold on. I just spent $20 million. I want my NFT.
Perhaps we can make the transfer at our offices.
Or how about my yacht?
[N8] Yeah, okay.
Follow me.
[in Italian] Interpol. Cultural Heritage Unit. Your auction is being robbed.
-What? -You need to lock everything down. Now!
[in English] Gotcha.
[N8] Where's the yacht?
This is the boat that takes us to the yacht.
Ross, what if Cyrus is making a play for the NFT?
[Ross] I thought he bought it?
[scoffs] For 20 million? No way he has that. It's a con.
But the only way to steal an NFT--
Is to steal the access code, and the only way to do that… is to steal the artist.
[in Italian] Stefano, I need a boat at the pier.
[Stefano] Yes, right away.
Just keep them in sight.
[Mi-Sun in English] Time to play.
Stop! [speaks Italian]
[in English] Looks like we've got a tail.
-[N8] What? -[Camila] Fans of yours?
[in Italian] Let's go!
[N8 in English] Are you sure this is safe?
[in Italian] Go faster!
No! No! No! No! No! Right! Right!
Go! Go! Go!
[Cyrus in English] Nicely done, team.
Put out a yellow notice for N8.
♪ Chain swanging, cling-clang And it cost a lot ♪
♪ I'm always at the guala Yeah, and you are not ♪
♪ Badass B, keep on going Till you hit the spot ♪
♪ Whoa, I'm a big bag hunter With the bow ♪ ♪ She got a big bad, drop it low ♪
♪ Mama called me And she happy with the growth… ♪
[Cyrus] Thank you.
[N8] Oh, nice.
You can take your mask off.
You can trust us.
[Cyrus] Come on. Let's get you paid.
[Cyrus] Nice doing business with you, N8.
[N8] Twenty mil?
-[Camila] Congratulations! -[Mi-Sun] Congrats!
-[N8 cheers] -[Cyrus] All right, my man! Let's make a toast!
[laughs, echoes] Yeah!
[Abby] Did you extract N8's footage?
It was on a loop, so all we have is the last 30 seconds.
Here's one angle.
Stop. Go back a few seconds.
The other bidder, make him larger.
The cane. Go back.
Now play it forward.
Stop. Go back.
Again.
[sighs] That limp is an act.
Find me bidder 1099.
Acclaimed American artist N8 is missing this morning
following an auction in Venice last night.
And it's being reported the artist's own cameras captured his abduction.
Interpol has put out a yellow notice asking anyone with information
Interpol has put out a yellow notice asking anyone with information on his whereabouts to contact their local police.
Look, it's you.
[N8] People think I'm missing?
Didn't you tell the auction house we were gonna be here?
Oh shit.
Shit.
Holy shit. You guys kidnapped me.
-Come on! -Do you feel kidnapped?
No.
-[Camila] Mm. -[N8] Who are you, Mr. Bratby?
Well, N8, my team and I
are real lovers of art.
-We love paintings. -Video art installations.
Sculptures.
Photography over here.
Street art, maybe.
But we've never lifted an NFT.
So you're thieves?
We rescue works of art from undeserving owners.
And while I took Interpol on a tour…
The rest of our team was in London, rescuing a Van Gogh.
But you bought my NFT, right? I mean, I saw--
A legit transaction.
We presold the Van Gogh on the black market for $20 million.
Enough to cover your NFT.
Then why did you fake my kidnapping?
Borrowing.
A human.
Leonardo da Vinci sold The Mona Lisa for $25,000,
and nobody gave a shit about it for 400 years until someone stole it.
That smile is now worth $860 million because there's a crazy story behind it.
Just like the one of us borrowing you.
And thanks to Interpol and all the free publicity, well,
the whole world now thinks that you've been kidnapped,
which only drove the price of the NFT through the roof.
-How much did we sell it for? -We just closed, uh…
Eighty-nine million.
What?!
Eighty-nine million.
What?
Eighty-nine million dollars.
I… I beat Van Gogh?
If my calculations are correct,
we made $42 million and you made 27 million.
Let's make a toast.
-All right. -To the world's first heist of an NFT!
-Hey! -[group] Cheers!
-[group cheers] -Cheers! Hey! Whoo!
Round of drinks on Luke, guys! Everyone! Round of drinks!
-No! -[Magnus] Yes!
Where's Denton?
[Abby] Forgery, fraud, fraud, money laundering, impersonation, fraud.
Hmm. Grand theft auto?
Yes.
It was a 1967 Ferrari Spider.
-What color? -Silver.
Walnut dash, cream leather interior.
And you crashed it into a canal?
Okay, I did.
You know, easy come, easy go.
So… you two go back to Chicago, huh?
I've never met this man before in my life.
Oliver might know who he is, though.
Who's Oliver?
Oliver! Oliver!
Oliver? [echoing]
Oliver!
Oliver would have never crashed the Ferrari.
He's too responsible.
Can I talk to Oliver?
No.
Okay, then. Let's talk about RICO.
Thanks to your mess-up with the cane,
we've got you placing a bid you didn't have the funds to cover, which is fraud.
And because it was over $10 million, you're eligible for extradition to the US,
where you're facing 20 years to life.
Twenty years is life.
And your friends are looking at kidnapping,
wire fraud, identity fraud, and transportation of stolen property.
Did I leave anything out?
A little joy, maybe.
[Ross] Boss. Got something.
This just came for you.
We're going back to London.
And we're taking him with us.
Yay.
Is Denton still in holding?
-You mean Oliver? -[scoffs] For real?
This Oliver, he is a real pain in the ass.
Gladwell. Come with me, please.
-I'm in the middle of something. -Right. Wasn't a request.
[Abby] Everything okay?
[Huxley] If it were, we'd be out of a job.
Listen, I, uh… I need to borrow your friend Cyrus.
He's not my friend. And what do you mean, "borrow"?
Well, in the same way that he would borrow a Picasso.
-I'm gonna offer him a deal. -[Abby] What?
-No. -[Huxley] Yeah.
No, no! You do not get to do this.
You think the art division is a third-rate department. It is.
But you do not get to wipe out a year of my work.
That's literally what I'm doing, so take a seat and let it sink in.
What do you know about Lars Jorgensen?
-He owns a hell of a lot of stolen art. -He's done a lot worse than that.
He started as a banker who was legit,
then began putting his money in terror groups, bankrolling attacks, then shorting irrelevant stocks and making a fortune.
bankrolling attacks, then shorting irrelevant stocks and making a fortune.
He doesn't care how many people die, just how much ends up in his bank account.
Remember the New Zealand plane that went down? 183 dead.
Airline stock plummeted just like those poor souls.
And guess who made a fortune off shorting that stock?
So why haven't you arrested him?
It's what I've been trying to do for years, but nothing can stick.
Everyone's scared of him.
Except that now, I have someone on the inside.
This guy.
Arthur Tigue.
Now, Jorgensen's been paying Tigue to work on something new.
I caught him, I turned him, and I got him to talk.
According to this weasel,
Jorgensen's been chatting with the hacker group Leviathan.
Leviathan?
[Huxley] They're planning some kind of massive strike on water.
Utilities, dams, it's all on the grid now.
They could flood a city.
Dry up a whole country if they wanted.
Millions could die.
And Jorgensen would make billions off it.
He's been shorting stocks and utilities. We don't know when or where he's gonna strike.
But what we do know is that Leviathan want their payment in gold.
Half a billion dollars in gold, to be precise.
And Jorgensen is gonna move it from his vault in London to Zurich in 17 days.
-You can't intercept it because it's… -Totally legal…
To move your own gold.
No.
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
-[Huxley] You don't know what I'll ask. -I do.
-You don't. -You want Cyrus to nick the gold.
Well, I wouldn't have used the word "nick," but--
You want to rely on Cyrus Whitaker for an operation of this scale?
Trust him with half a billion dollars worth of gold?
Yeah, why not?
He's a thief, a con man, a professional liar.
You cannot possibly trust him.
I work in a building with intelligence agents,
and I don't trust any of them. 'Cause we're all liars. All of us.
-What's another one? -It is not the same thing.
Our job is to do things we don't like and make calls we don't want,
so the rest of the world can just carry on.
What if he says no?
It's your job to make sure that doesn't happen.
Took you long enough.
Can I get you a drink?
What is it? Tequila during the day, vodka by night, right?
-I'll get it. -[chuckles]
All the good stuff is in the back.
Yeah. But we wouldn't want you to take all year to find it. Let me help you.
You look good.
You know, it is pretty funny that the thing that got you busted was an NFT.
A little tacky.
Sometimes, you gotta roll with the times. And stop, we didn't steal anything.
That NFT was a completely legitimate transaction.
Right. Of course.
-[takes a deep breath] Am I in trouble? -For stealing a Van Gogh?
We caught your buyer.
He gave up Denton, Luke, and Magnus.
That was real cute, by the way, nicking the painting that was in the NFT.
Thought you'd appreciate the artistry involved.
You stole art, Cyrus. You didn't make it.
Are you still pissed about Paris?
-I'm not going to discuss that with you. -No?
-No. -I was kind of hoping we could.
-It was a mistake, okay? An accident. -An accident? For a full week?
It was five days, not a week!
A business week.
And if I'd have known who you were, what you did,
it would never have happened.
So, what about you?
I mean, I thought I was going to dinner with the curator of the Gagosian.
-I was undercover. -So was I.
-Not the same. -Agree to disagree.
We fell for the cover. That's it.
That's all it was.
Okay, so what is this?
-Are you here to arrest me, Abby? -Agent Gladwell.
Agent? [scoffs]
And no.
I have been ordered to offer you a deal.
-That's gotta sting, huh? -[sighs] Is that why you're so pissed?
What kind of deal?
We need you to steal something.
I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you. Do me a favor. Say it again.
-But slower. Say it slower this time. -Gold. A lot of gold.
Half a billion dollars' worth.
What's the catch?
The owner of the gold is a man named Lars Jorgensen.
You know him?
By reputation, yeah.
There's some people you steal from, and there's some people that you don't steal from.
Lars Jorgensen kills both.
It's a hard pass for me.
We have you on the Van Gogh, Cyrus.
Denton will die in jail.
If you do this, it's full immunity for you and your crew.
All felonies wiped clean, past and present.
Camila hasn't seen her family in eight years.
Mi-Sun has a grandmother who doesn't have long to live.
Luke gets to see his poodle again.
Magnus gets to go to the Cajun Stage at Jazz Fest.
Denton gets to go home, and you…
You get to do
whatever it is you do
without looking over your shoulder all the time.
-Where are you at in all this? -What do you mean?
What's your role in the operation?
This is my role. I make you the offer, that's it.
No, no. If we're signing up for this, then so are you.
Look, I know how these things work. If Interpol's involved,
that means as soon as things hit the fan that we're left hung out to dry.
But if you're with us, then they can't do that.
With you?
On the team.
-Interpol would never allow it. -So then ask them.
No you, no deal.
You got 24 hours to respond, Agent Gladwell.
[Camila] No.
She's Interpol.
-Are you crazy? -Absolutely not. No disrespect, yeah?
-But no. -It's a setup.
It's a half a billion in gold.
-That we don't get to keep. -Yeah, but we get to see it.
What do you want me to say?
If we don't do this, we go to jail. She has us on the Van Gogh.
Plus, and not that this should sway anyone, but it's about saving lives.
-Saving lives. Lovely. -Don't lead with that.
-[Magnus] Boo! -Oh no, no. No, no.
I don't appreciate the emotional blackmail, Cyrus.
[tuts] This is not emotional blackmail. This is blackmail blackmail.
I just want to say that I am liking the vibes here.
I think they're good. I think it's fun. I'm on board.
Yeah. Of course you are. Because you're crazy.
[Magnus] We gotta stay positive.
-Come on, you don't have to throw a no-- -Take a moment. Don't escalate it.
-Get out of here! -[Magnus] You get outta here!
Tiny!
-Hey! It's Oliver! -[group laughs]
Oliver!
I love Oliver!
Agent Gladwell, I just wanted to introduce you to Oliver.
Wow, I have heard a lot about you.
-[Magnus] Oliver's my favorite. -[Mi-Sun] Steve?
[Magnus] Scary.
All right, Agent Gladwell has the floor. Let's give our attention.
-[sighs] Why should we? -Because she caught us.
She knows what she's doing. Go ahead.
Thank you.
Okay.
So, 17 days from now, Lars Jorgensen is moving
half a billion dollars in gold bars from his bank in London to Zurich.
Nice.
[Abby] The bars will be packed in a single four-foot square crate,
total weight, ten tons,
then delivered by truck from the bank to Heathrow under heavy guard
and loaded onto a Sky Suisse passenger plane to Zurich.
So, somewhere between the Bank of London
and the runway in Zurich, the gold needs to disappear.
Gold needs to disappear. Great.
That gave me chills.
Well, it's an exciting story. It's…
-It's impossible. -It's not impossible.
Oh, this is.
Stay positive. We can do this. Try it with me.
[in Spanish] What I can do is beat your ass. Want your ass beat?
I can understand what you're saying.
[in English] Come on. Stop. Camila, I'm with you.
I don't know if it's possible.
I don't like it any more than any of you, but we know the rules to our game.
-When you're beat, what do you do? -Accept defeat gracefully?
AKA you go to jail or…
[group] Look for the nearest exit.
That's right! This is it. So we do it, we do it well, and we get out.
Let's treat it like any other lift.
Examine it from top to bottom, find a weakness.
If there's a way to do it, we find it.
None of us want to go to jail.
And we damn sure don't want to piss off Lars Jorgensen.
Morning, Arthur.
So you didn't make it home from the pub last night, then, eh?
-[Arthur grunts] Okay! Okay! -[line ringing]
[Arthur] Stop!
[Cormac] Hey, Jorgensen,
you remember Arthur Tigue.
He used to work for us.
Yes. Mr. Tigue.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there in person.
I just arrived at my villa.
Please, sir! I'm sorry!
Stop begging. It'll just make him more inclined to violence.
You were arrested last month on smuggling charges.
And yet, here you are, a free man.
It's odd.
Very odd.
Interpol only knows half the story!
What about the other half?
You should have kept your mouth shut.
Now we are going to shut it for you.
-[Arthur] No! -Cormac, feed the dog.
-[Arthur] No! Cormac, please! -[barking and snarling]
What are you doing?
I hope you know your team have been working all night
and half the day trying to figure this out.
The teachers hated you, didn't they?
What? No. I was top of the class. They loved me.
No. They had to pretend to like students like you
because, technically, you followed all the rules and got good grades.
What's wrong with that?
It's boring.
Anybody can do what they're told. Anybody can memorize facts.
Anybody can shine an apple on their ass.
And what were you like? Class clown? Wiseass?
I was the opposite.
I was silent.
I was watching the kids look at the blackboard,
answering the questions where they thought they should answer.
I never looked at the blackboard.
I was looking at the questions that weren't being asked.
To cool for school, huh?
I saw the path that they were being marched down,
and I also saw a different path, a better one for me.
So I took it.
By breaking the rules?
The rules were already broken for someone like me.
And if I can remember correctly, you broke a few rules that week in Paris.
Five days! And yes, I did.
I broke the rules for the first time in my life
and look what good it did me.
-Why do you care about 'em? -About what?
The rules. Why do you care so much about the rules?
Okay.
Okay, when I was a kid,
my mom was headmistress at my school.
It was kind of a shithole, but it had this picture,
a Hockney print that had been given to the school in the '70s,
and my mum refused to sell it.
Because she wanted us to know that we deserved beautiful things.
That our school was just as important as some swanky art gallery.
That we should all dream big.
And then someone stole it.
Middle of the night.
And I thought,
"When I grow up
I'm going to find out who did that
and bring them down."
And did you?
No.
But I did the next best thing.
Interpol.
-Dream big. -[chuckles]
I admire that.
Oh no.
-No, no, no. I'm not doing this. -Doing what? What are you talking about?
Getting sucked in to a conversation with you.
-Conversation. Is that dangerous? -How did you put it with your team?
"Find the weakness, do the job, and get out"?
-Is that what you think I did? -I know it is.
I would never lift from anyone that doesn't deserve to lose it.
And if I do my job well,
well, the thing I took, they'll never know was missing.
So you're saying we need to take the gold
in a way that Jorgensen never knows it's missing.
We're not taking the gold.
That's the problem on the blackboard. We're looking at a different problem.
We are taking the plane?
Nice!
-The whole plane? -It's kind of hard to take half a plane.
With 250 people on board?
We're not hijacking a plane, Cyrus. It's not the '70s.
We're not hijacking anything, Camila.
Don't ever use that word.
-We're borrowing it. -Love it. Love it.
But how?
To take a plane, you gotta fake a plane.
-All you need is a private jet. -Oh, just like that?
Yeah. If you can get the planes close enough together,
you can swap the radar signature.
-I like it. -Pulling up the flight logs now.
See if we know anyone on the sheets.
Drake's Boeing is at Farnborough. He must have a gig in London.
Too big.
The King's Hawker is at Northolt.
Too small.
-Oh. -You're gonna like this.
You want me to give you my jet?
No, I want to rent it.
But there are apps for that, man.
Or I can get my guy N8 to make an NFT specifically for you.
I don't know. My jet is priceless.
It's a one-off concept model. NASA R&D.
Hell, technically, it's not even legal with the mods.
Especially with the glass roof.
I'm not supposed to fly in American airspace.
[quietly] I do, though.
It's worth it too, to watch the stars while, you know, you get your groove on.
-Here's the thing-- -Yeah?
You told an officer at Interpol you've been illegally flying in US airspace.
-But, he-- -[Abby] So how about this?
We take the plane, and there's nothing you can do about it.
[Mollsen] Everything is remote-controlled.
Doors, lights. Amazing, right?
That is a word that you could use.
Leave it. No, don't sit down.
-Why not? -Because I don't know what that stain is.
Bang-bang!
Oh, stripper pole.
Oh, oh! And the best part of this baby is the whole of the underneath
is a huge LED screen, which we can program
to say whatever
we want.
Gucci life.
Ball so hard. Ball so hard. Ball so hard.
-You don't have to do that. -Ball so hard.
We get it.
-Ball so-- -We understand.
Come on.
So this is the best Interpol could do?
You work for the government now, Cyrus.
Doesn't it make you feel all warm and fuzzy?
No. [chuckles] Not one bit.
So, let's break it down.
We gotta make that jet invisible to radar,
find a way to get it close to an A380 to swap signals,
then crack a safe at 30,000 feet.
Piece of cake.
[Magnus] Cyrus.
-Yeah? -All right, you gotta see this.
The sound waves mimic the turbulence of the plane!
Look, Lebron James!
♪ You wanted to ♪ -[song ends] -With this laser, I could crack this vault
anywhere on earth in ten minutes flat, but it's gotta be on earth.
Up in the plane, the turbulence is going to shake the laser.
If I'm a millimeter off in any direction, this… this vault turns into an impenetrable steel box.
this… this vault turns into an impenetrable steel box.
So you need a stabilizer.
Stewart platform?
Stewart platform. That's it.
Stewart platform! Genius! Someone give me a hug!
-A lot of caffeine. -Mm.
[automated voice] Descend! Descend!
Descend!
[Camila] I keep getting caught in the A380's wake.
Stop it. I've seen you handle much worse.
You remember Corsica, don't you?
-Okay. -[laughs]
Camila needs help staying out of the A380's wake.
Can you work N8's cameras into your stealth mods
to give her full visibility around the plane?
I mean, at those speeds, it just hasn't been done before.
First time for everything.
-I mean, if anybody can do it, you can. -Yeah.
[Cyrus] Right?
I got it.
My guy.
Mi-Sun, I'm gonna need a hand.
Hey, uh, too much? Or--
Are you going for, like, Gandalf the Grey? Or Moses?
-No. -[Cyrus] Then, yeah, that's too much.
-Am I crazy? -Yes.
-You think I should call it off? -No, of course not.
I don't know.
You're uncertain? I don't think I've seen that before.
I just don't like that it's her who asked.
-You know the history there, right? -No.
Met a year ago in Paris at the Biennale,
but neither of us were honest about our circumstances, so…
I see.
But it was nothing. It was a week. A business week, not even a full week.
Right. I understand.
Why you say it like that? What does that mean?
Well, it's just, you know, the way you look at her.
The way I look at her? How do I look at her?
-What are you doing? -This is what…
You saying I make that face? -I've never made a face like that. -This?
[Cyrus] Nobody makes that face. All right, how about you stop?
Let's stop. You're being stupid.
-Grow up, you're being childish. -[Denton] Look at me.
-I'm looking at you! -Now look at her.
-You want me to look? -Yeah.
Look like a damn creep. Proud of yourself?
-Yes. -It doesn't matter, right?
I mean, what we're talking about, this thing like that, it'll never happen.
-Why not? -What do you mean, why not?
-Yeah? -The same reason none of us are married.
Why we don't have kids, why you don't have a personal life.
The game we're in is not compatible with love.
-That's a little lonely, no? -[Cyrus] Lonely?
How about when we partied for New Year's Eve, Taj Mahal?
I'm saying there's respect and there's admiration and friendships,
but is there closeness? Is there intimacy?
I just told you. That's not what it is.
-Right, it's nothing. -It's not--
I know. I heard you. You said that. Nothing.
-Think about it. -Thanks, boss.
So Luke is working on making the private jet invisible to GPS,
but to do the same for the A380, we need a PSID.
What's that?
Portable Signal Interference Device.
It blocks all GPS transmissions from the A380 to air traffic control.
But I'm already working on getting the parts. They'll be here tomorrow.
Okay, so what's the problem?
The chance of us turning on the PSID and the transponder at the exact same moment
in two different planes, both moving over 700 miles per hour,
is next to impossible.
So if air traffic control suddenly see two planes with the same signal
or if the A380 suddenly disappears…
[scoffs] It's over.
If you can't hack the tech, you gotta hack the people.
-We need someone in air traffic control. -In Brussels.
-We need someone in air traffic control. -In Brussels. Why Brussels?
The minute the plane crosses the English Channel,
that's who'll be tracking it till Zurich.
Do we know someone in Brussels?
I know someone. [sighs]
He's a piece of shit, but I know someone.
[grunts] Well, I don't know what this is, but it's not a cappuccino, Claude.
Screw you, Harry.
Hey! I'm trying to help you. I'm being honest.
People won't stand for that.
Starbucks'll come along, and you'll be done.
I'm not going to pay for it.
I'll drink it.
I'm just not going to pay for it.
Sort your life out, yeah?
Free coffee?
You know this guy, how?
Harry is an informant.
We had to relocate him to Belgium, because so many people wanted him dead.
Thought you were here to ask me a favor.
We are. We need help with air traffic control in Brussels.
Someone who can communicate with the pilots,
overlook any potential glitches.
Glitches.
Sounds nefarious. Is this official?
Yes and no.
[sighs] Then I could lose my job. I could go to jail.
They could pin a terrorism charge on me, so thanks, but no thanks.
Interpol will protect you.
[sighs] I really, really want to say yes, but…
You'll be saving lives.
We'll pay you a million dollars.
Happy to be in business with you.
-Cyrus. We don't have that kind of money. -I do.
-You'd do that? -Yeah, it's about saving lives, isn't it?
Listen to the man! Listen to him.
You wouldn't happen to know anyone who can load cargo off an A380, would you?
I might know a few people, yeah.
It's Huxley. He wants to see us.
Hey.
Commander Dennis Huxley, London Metropolitan Police Service,
seconded to Interpol Anti-Terrorism.
Is that your full name?
Why don't we take a seat? This'll be quick.
Really?
[Cyrus] Okay, big dog.
So, Arthur Tigue washed up on the Irish coast in six grocery bags.
-What? -Who's Arthur Tigue?
You didn't tell him?
Arthur Tigue was an employee of Jorgensen.
And he was found dead?
Yeah, and it's why we think the bank's brought the transfer to ten days from now.
Ten days?
That's not enough time. I'm sorry, Abby, I'm out.
Cyrus, it's--
You're out? I didn't realize this was an opt-in situation.
-It was when I opted in. -Uh-huh.
And unlike Arthur Tigue, I'm smart enough to walk away.
You're smart or you're scared?
'Cause you're worried that you're going to get killed? Don't worry.
You're from the art world, and you're small-time.
Made you a brilliant choice. No one's expecting anything from Cyrus Whitaker.
And if you don't do this, I will take away your immunity,
and I'll bring the power of international law down on you and your misfits.
Comprende, homeboy?
-Better get your boy. -[Abby] Guys!
Guys, innocent people's lives are on the line.
I will talk to my team,
but understand that if we do this, we're doing it for you.
It's not for him.
See you back in London.
Don't say it.
"Homeboy?"
[man on TV] …saying his cabinet will meet tomorrow morning,
in order to declare a state of alarm.
-Luke? -[Luke] Yeah?
Turn that up.
Once again, chaos in Madrid tonight
with reports that cyberterrorists have targeted the city's main water grid.
Reports of widespread flooding in the streets and subways,
and pipes bursting in homes across the city.
The death toll currently stands at 13, but that number is expected to rise.
Is this him? Jorgensen?
Looks like it.
Oh my God.
[Camila] Why would anyone do something like this?
[Cyrus] He'll sacrifice anyone to make a profit.
And these are just the starters. The main course is in ten days.
Ten days?
You're kidding, right?
No, I'm not kidding.
I'm pulling it. This is no longer our job.
-What? Cyrus, you said-- -I said I would.
The deal was me.
I told you when you joined the crew I'd never let you walk into certain danger.
I'm telling you all to walk away.
And what's your plan without us?
I'll figure it out. It's not your problem, not anymore.
-You're serious? -I am.
[chuckles] You just expect us to walk away and let you have all the fun? No.
-That look like fun? -[Magnus] Not that.
We're dealing with a guy willing to kill whatever gets in his way.
I'm sorry, it's too much of a risk.
You know how much I like risk.
It's not just about us.
I'm in.
Me too.
-Denton-- -Cyrus, I'm in.
Yeah, me too.
I can't leave you with… this.
Count me in too.
[coughs] Yeah, me too, I… I guess.
You can't do this without us.
[Camila chuckles] Let's work.
They really love you.
I mean, what's not to love?
-What did it take you? Like a week? -Oh my God.
You are really, really easy to hate.
Agree to disagree.
-[softly] Five days. -[chuckles]
I'm impressed.
My portfolio thanks you.
[leader on phone] You wanted proof. Leviathan always delivers.
[Jorgensen] You can end your little demonstration now.
Just have our gold ready.
I will.
[Mi-Sun] I built the PSID so we can make the A380 disappear from radar,
but there's one small issue.
It looks like a bomb.
-Yeah. -[Cyrus] Is that not a bomb?
-Definitely looks like a bomb. -Yeah.
Does it separate into parts?
In theory.
So, could you hide those parts and then give each of us pieces?
Then we reassemble it on the plane.
Hmm. Possible.
-[Mi-Sun] For you, Abby. -Thank you.
-[Mi-Sun] For Luke. -Thank you.
[Mi-Sun] And that's for you, Magnus.
Game on.
Okay, guys, listen up.
We need to intercept the gold before it gets to Jorgensen
so he can't pay the hackers.
[Luke] A little more to the left. Just checking the LED screen now.
-We get the pilot we wanted? -[Mi-Sun] Yes.
With experience landing in Afghanistan.
That's good. He can handle the short, snowy runway in the Alps.
Camila, that's when you deploy the drone to Zurich, and you follow us to Cortina.
Magnus, need you to keep an eye on the clock.
You got ten minutes once you start on that safe.
-11:55! -So close!
When we land, Harry's guys'll be on the ground
to offload the gold onto a train by the landing strip.
At the next station,
Interpol will be waiting to receive our half billion in gold.
I like this one.
-9:38! -9:38! 9:38! -9:38! -Whoo-hoo!
-Yes! -[alert beeps]
Yes! Whoo!
-Yo! -No.
[groans] Oh my God!
If it was in a movie, it would go like, "Hey, let's steal a plane!"
You'd put your hand in, and people would be like… "Ah!"
Stop doing that!
-Honestly, it's just awkward. -It felt like the moment.
[Luke] Read the room.
-["777" ends] -So how stealth is it, exactly?
To a radar,
it will be like a small bird.
Practically undetectable.
I don't think I want Mollsen to have that capability.
-So you think you can fly it? -I guess we'll find out tomorrow.
[Cyrus] Rest up. Tomorrow's the biggest lift of our lives.
This is the outfit you chose?
This is what I'm wearing for this incredibly serious operation?
Jorgensen is gonna have guys on the plane.
Sometimes the best way to blend in is to stand out.
Nobody's gonna suspect the rich douche and his trophy wife
sitting in first class, sipping champagne.
Oh, is calling me a trophy wife your idea of flattery?
No.
Calling you my wife was.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard Sky Suisse flight 1412
with service to Zurich International Airport continuing to Melbourne.
-All carry-on items should now be stowed… -You nervous?
Right now? Very much so.
-You? -No. [sighs]
I love every second of this.
Is everybody in position?
I'm all set.
Good to go.
Luke, what about you?
Luke?
Did anybody see Luke get on the plane?
Luke, where are you, buddy?
I'm sorry. I, uh…
I couldn't do it.
It's just not worth the risk.
[softly] We lost Luke.
All good. I'll see you on the other side.
Sorry, boss.
-No worries. -[phone beeps]
Mi-Sun, how bad is this gonna hurt us?
Luke had the signal booster,
so the PSID will still work, but only if it's close to the cockpit.
How close?
Mm, thirty feet?
Someone has to go to the coach bathroom, where the pieces are,
and take 'em to the first-class bathroom?
[Mi-Sun] Yeah.
I'll do it.
Are you sure you want to take this on?
Yeah.
All right, Mi-Sun, Abby's gonna handle the PSID.
You just gotta tell her how it works.
[exhales, in Spanish] Okay.
[in English] Guys, we've got eyes on us.
Two in first class.
Three in economy.
[Cyrus] Copy that. Keep your eyes open in case they make a move.
[flight attendant] Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached cruising altitude.
You are free to move about the cabin.
[Magnus] Game on.
Just in time. We should be over the English Channel now.
Victor Sierra 14-12, Brussels, continue at 34,000,
and expect slight turbulence going over the top of the mountains.
There's a low-pressure system forming.
Copy that, control.
Here you are.
Abby, you're up.
Ten minutes till we rendezvous with Camila.
-You sure you're up for this? -Yeah.
I'm going in.
[captain] This is the captain speaking. We're approaching a low-pressure system.
Could give us a little turbulence up ahead.
For your safety, I've turned on the fasten seatbelt sign.
[under breath] Shit!
No, no! No, no, no!
Here we go.
-[Cyrus] Abby, it's me. -[door unlocks]
Baby, I need your help in here.
What did you do?
-Tell me you know how to help me fix this! -Shit! I don't know. I think so.
[Mi-Sun] Abby, what's going on?
We're running out of time. Camila's almost on our tail.
[gruffly] Hurry up, eh? Come on.
[panting] Oh yeah, baby!
Oh yeah!
[automated voice] Traffic! Traffic! Traffic! Traffic!
[automated voice] Traffic!
[Abby moans] Keep going!
-All right, how long until the switch? -A minute, 30 seconds.
-[speaking Spanish] -[automated voice] Descend! Descend!
[in Spanish] Come on.
[automated voice in English] Descend! Descend!
-Descend! -[moans]
[automated voice] Descend! Descend!
[automated voice] Descend! Descend!
[automated voice] Descend! Descend!
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no…
-[console chimes] -[suspenseful music fades]
Oh shit. Come on. Come on.
Almost there. Almost there, baby. Don't stop!
[woman] Pardon, Harry, are you seeing this?
What?
The… the board is showing two Victor Sierra 14-12s.
Oh, it's probably just a glitch. Happens every now and then.
I have never seen this before.
Are you going to notify Jean-Pierre?
Sandra, I'm gonna have to start reporting this
relentless undermining behavior to HR.
-What? -You think I'm unable to do my job.
Is it 'cause of the chair?
What? No!
'Cause your constant challenging of my decision-making,
it… it makes me feel attacked and… and, frankly, unsafe. [sighs]
I'm… I'm so sorry.
There. See?
You really should look at your unexamined prejudices, Sandra, yeah?
-[sighs] Okay. -Course. Off you pop.
-Okay. -Wait, wait, wait.
Now it's real.
[quietly] Excuse me.
-All yours, big guy. -Mm.
[sighs] Harry, I just wanted to say I'm so sorry about before.
-Were you getting a coffee? -No. But I could!
Cappuccino, please. From the good place.
-Where is the good place? -Kind of busy, Sandra.
Oh, okay.
Victor Sierra, 14-12. Control.
[pilot] This is Victor Sierra, 14-12.
We have an AWOS warning coming out of Zurich.
High winds, extreme weather, low visibility and falling.
Flooding on the runway.
Zurich tower is diverting all inbound traffic to the nearest airport.
Copy that, control. Yeah. We just felt a few bumps.
Which airport would that be?
Please proceed to Charlie Delta Foxtrot.
Short runway, but it shouldn't be too challenging for a pilot of your skill.
Copy that, control.
-Proceeding as directed. -[sighs] Victor Sierra 14-12.
Set course to Cortina.
Control to Victor Sierra 14-12.
VS 14-12, go ahead.
You are clear for deployment.
[Camila] Roger that.
Okay, boss.
The drone is heading to Zurich.
See you in Cortina.
[Harry] Victor Sierra 14-12, confirming your approach to Zurich is on course.
-[PA chimes] -This is the captain speaking.
Unfortunately, the weather in Zurich has taken a severe turn.
We've been instructed to land in Cortina, the nearest airport.
Denton, Magnus, it's vault time.
Our friends are getting restless, but we gotta stick to the clock.
Miss!
[grunts] I was wondering if you could…
[sniffles] Well, I'm having trouble with the flight entertainment.
Of course, sir. It's a bit tricky, isn't it?
I was wondering if it's this button.
-[attendant] Yes. This button, right here. -[Denton] Course. This button here?
[attendant] There you go. Then you just pick and choose--
[Denton] There you go! Is that okay?
This is wonderful. I think I'll watch me a movie or something.
[attendant] Wonderful!
[Cyrus] All right, Mi-Sun, you're up.
-Okay. -Lock down outside communications.
Cutting off the Wi-Fi now.
Excuse me, there's no vaping on the flight.
Look at that. You caught me. I wouldn't dream of it.
I'll take these.
[Cyrus] Thank you.
[flight attendant] We apologize for the interruption with the Wi-Fi.
We are working to correct the problem.
Mi-Sun, how's the door sensor?
You're good to go. Just be careful of that pressure variance.
[Magnus] Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mom.
[Magnus] Showtime.
-Showtime? -[keypad beeps]
It's supposed to be cool. Showtime! Show-- [groans]
[quietly] Shit.
I'm sorry, sir, but you'll have to take your seat.
Sláinte.
[attendant] Sir!
We're landing in Zurich.
All right, page the captain.
Tell him we got a medical emergency. Oi?
They won't open the door.
They will when they know you're the one with the emergency.
Trying to get in the cockpit.
-We gotta buy Magnus some time. -[grunts]
-Cyrus! -[both grunt]
Come on!
Shit!
Yes!
Come on. We gotta go check on Magnus.
Gear down.
[pilot] Flight attendants, get everyone to their seats.
About to check on the gold, were we?
-They got the vault open, but that's it. -Did you check it?
Cyrus, I was so close. I'm sorry.
You did good, buddy.
See, Cormac. We did you proud!
Oh, you think that, do you? You think Jorgensen's gonna be proud of this?!
[Cormac] Yes, sir?
Cormac, I've just had a phone call from my men at Zurich airport.
And you know what they told me?
A drone landed in Zurich.
-It's under control, sir. -[door opens]
Team of thieves tried to jack the payload, but we took 'em down.
-The gold's all here. -Where is "here"?
It's a small airstrip in the Alps.
These amateurs provided a second plane.
Who are they?
Just some small-time crooks trying to make a name for themselves.
Then I can help them.
Bring the thieves and the gold to me here.
You have an hour.
-[Cormac] Come! -[Cyrus] All right.
-[Camila] No, no, no… -[Cormac] Let's go.
What happened?
You're working for me now. We're flying to Tuscany.
-It's just a little detour. That's all. -Shut up. You're coming with me.
-It's not a smart move. -Interpol knows where we are.
-They'll follow us. -Not if they can't see us.
We were tracking the Airbus the whole way, and we didn't see this jet.
So neither will your friends.
Get the gold on board.
Wait. Wait, no. The jet can't take that much weight.
[Cyrus] That's why we got the trains.
It's at the end of the runway. Look, if you don't believe us,
send one of your guys so they can see.
Well, I'll take my chances with the jet, but we'll lighten the load.
Dispose of him.
-No. Wait. Wait. Hey! Hey! Hey! -[Cormac] You two, let's go.
Let's go!
[Stefano] Sir! Sir?
-We just got word from Brussels. -Uh-huh?
There was an attempt to breach the plane's cockpit.
[sighs] Okay, go on.
Passengers intervened,
then they forced a couple passengers onto a private jet.
-Well, where's the jet now? -We are having trouble tracking it, sir.
Then what are you doing standing here? Go find it!
You strapped in tight?
Yes.
Good.
What the hell was that?
-Answer him. -It's the gold!
It's throwing us off balance. I told you.
[quietly] She's not done.
She's shaking off the stealth mods, isn't she?
She sure is.
[goon] Keep it moving!
Yeah. I'm just not really a gun guy, so I get a little nervous.
I mean, you can have your Second Amendment rights. Do you--
-[goon] Stop talking! -Okay.
-Stop talking. Just keep walking. -Okay. That is a cool gun.
I'm guessing the barrel is carbon nanofiber harvested from a vape pen with liquid propellant.
harvested from a vape pen with liquid propellant. That is awesome.
-Turn around! -Okay! Okay. Okay.
I don't do guns!
[Magnus] I'm sorry about the nose, but we're cool, right?
I'll go my way, you go yours.
Okay. I'm good.
That's…
Okay.
You should probably call a doctor!
We have located the jet, sir. It's headed toward Italy.
[Huxley] Doesn't Jorgensen have property here?
Yes, there's a villa under a shell company in Tuscany.
Should we send in the Carabinieri?
[Huxley] We don't have hard evidence on him yet.
Get me a line to NATO. I'll tell them we have an unidentified jet
that's a terrorist threat, and we need to shoot them down.
But Agent Gladwell could be on it.
[Huxley] We can't risk Jorgensen getting that gold.
Get me NATO.
Copy. NFR 180, proceed to waypoint to confirm visual.
Oh, Leviathan. Welcome. Nice to meet some of you in person.
Where is the gold?
Leviathan didn't send me here for small talk.
[leader] My colleague in Zurich says your plane did not land.
That was our plan to distract the authorities.
The gold will arrive here.
Well, I hope so. We don't want to have to empty all your bank accounts.
What do you mean?
The Caymans, Monaco, Panama, Switzerland, Singapore, and the Maldives.
We know where your money is.
And we can make it all disappear in seconds.
That's why we only deal in gold.
Unhackable,
untraceable.
It will be here within an hour.
[Harry] Oh shit.
Get me NATO.
[NATO pilot on radio] This is NATO First Response.
I say again, this is NATO First Response.
You are in direct violation of civilian aviation regulations.
Identify, or we will engage with force.
-Civilian aircraft… -Don't answer.
[pilot] I say again, you are in direct violation of civilian aviation regulations.
Establish radio contact immediately,
or you will be fired upon with live ordnance.
November Foxtrot Romeo 180, please be advised,
you're tracking a private aircraft.
There are civilians on board. Repeat, there are civilians on board.
[NATO air control] NFR to Commander Huxley.
We have unconfirmed reports of civilians on board.
Say again.
Unconfirmed from Brussels ATC, civilians on the aircraft.
Repeated attempts to contact have been met with radio silence. Please advise.
Look, we don't know if they're on that plane.
If that plane makes it, then people are gonna die.
We can't let Leviathan get that gold. Do you hear me?
Whatever they're planning is bigger and deadlier than Madrid,
and we can't risk it.
[NATO air control] What's your order, Commander?
Shoot it down.
[NATO air control] Copy. NFR 180, continue to attempt contact.
If unresponsive, commence 60-second warning on aircraft.
[under breath] Oh shit. Shit, shit, shit.
-They're gonna shoot us down. -They're bluffing!
[NATO pilot] Systems armed.
[NATO pilot] Weapons hot.
Unidentified aircraft, be advised.
You have 60 seconds to establish radio contact on 132.175.
Abby! "Ball so hard!"
[NATO pilot] Twenty seconds!
-[both groan] -[NATO pilot] Ten seconds!
Oh my God!
[NATO pilot] Control, we have contact. Civilian hostages on board.
That's what I've been saying!
[NATO pilot] Please advise.
NFR 180, stand down. Repeat, stand down.
Commander Huxley, we have confirmation of civilians on board.
We're tracking the flight now,
and we'll notify the local authorities upon its descent and landing.
Copy.
[NATO pilot] Stand down and break off.
Repeat, standing down and breaking off.
Yes! Yes!
Make sure she lands the damn plane!
Right the plane!
-[groans] -Sorry about that.
-Take it down! Now! -[crying] Okay! I'm sorry.
Get the remote!
-Hit it now! -[remote beeps]
Bang-bang.
We gotta get to the cockpit!
-[alarms beeping] -Grab him! I can't fly.
My wrist!
Okay, switch. Switch. Switch.
Camila, tell us what to do!
Pull up! Pull up! Pull up! Pull up! Pull up!
[exhales] Okay. You okay?
I'm loving every second of this. [chuckles]
What was that? What just happened?
-[Camila] No! -[Cyrus] What happened?
-[Abby] Camila! -What just happened?
-We lost the hydraulic pump! -What does that mean?
[Camila] Steering is almost impossible.
[on earpiece] We've got to land now, or we'll lose control!
I'm gonna try to steer us using the engines. Yeah!
[Abby] That's Jorgensen's compound.
No, no, no. We're coming in too fast! We can't make the landing strip!
We're gonna have to use the road.
There's your gold, right on time.
We're coming in hot!
Pull up! Give it everything you have! Pull up! Pull up!
-I can't believe it. -[Camila sighs]
We did it.
-[sighs] -[Abby on earpiece] We did it.
Yeah.
We successfully landed the gold on Jorgensen's estate.
[in Italian] Out!
Let's go!
[in English] Remember Venice?
Of course.
[Camila on earpiece] Why are you bringing up Venice now, Cyrus?
God, I really loved that NFT.
[quietly] Yeah.
Now, Mi-Sun, you know what we need to do.
-[on earpiece] Follow Cyrus's lead. -I'm on it.
-[guards shouting in Italian] -[Jorgensen] Cormac? Where is Cormac?
Cormac didn't make it.
Who the hell are you?
-Get the boats ready. -It's, uh, Leviathan, right?
-[leader] What is going on? -I assure you, all is under control.
I'm not gonna ask you again.
-Who are you? -[leader] Interpol.
Just got this. One of them is Interpol!
This is over. We're out.
That was a clean shot through your leg so you can still type on your computer.
Next shot, no more typing.
Do we still have a deal?
As you can see, I don't like to repeat myself, so…
Which one of you is Interpol?
It's me.
It's me. I'm Interpol.
Agent Gladwell.
These are just civilians that your guys took hostage. You can let them go.
Say goodbye, Agent Gladwell.
[officer 1 in Italian] Hands up, guns down!
[officer 2] Hands up!
Agent Gladwell, Interpol.
-[sighs] -[Abby in English] She's been shot!
[in Italian] It was him!
[in English] These people are intruders.
I was defending my property.
Now, hold on.
You collect art, right?
NFTs.
You know, some people say that they're a passing fad.
I say that all art just depends on the artist.
Mi-Sun, play it.
My pleasure.
[Cyrus] Enjoy prison.
-[officer 3 in Italian] Let's go. -Move!
[in English] Wait!
Well done, Mi-Sun.
[Jorgensen in Italian] Bloody hell!
[in English] Agent Gladwell!
Agent Gladwell.
I guess we're done.
Thanks for the backup, Stefano.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't sure you were going to make it.
Neither was I.
[Stefano] Abby, the NATO jets were this close.
Let's go.
Yeah.
Thank God Huxley stopped them.
It was Huxley that stopped them, right?
Stefano?
Abby, let me explain.
No need.
I quit.
You need a lift?
♪ Never have things for a normal life ♪ ♪ It's time ♪
Where are we?
[chuckles] You'll see.
You know, I didn't trust Huxley.
You were obviously right about that.
But I've always trusted you.
That was never in question.
You know, in Paris, our first week… [sighs]
…I didn't fall in love with the cover.
I fell in love with the way you looked at the art,
the way that you cared about something that wasn't even yours.
Losing you during that week was the stupidest thing I've ever done
in a lifetime full of stupid things.
I don't want to lose you again.
So, I got you something.
[Abby] "Liam Dower"?
Liam Dower stole your mother's Hockney print.
What?
-How did you-- -I asked around.
I found him, found out who he sold it to, and I bought it.
You bought it?
For your school.
Now, I want you to hold on to that feeling.
Like, hold it. Because there's more.
Another little thing.
A little something. There's a little more. Um…
We stole the gold.
-What? -Yeah.
-How? -Okay, the first part, you knew about.
The part of the plan you didn't know about,
while we recruited Harry in Brussels,
Magnus dipped hundreds of iron bars in gold paint
which we sent on our own crates via Sky Suisse cargo.
On the plane, while we were distracting the guys up top,
[Cyrus] Magnus waited until the plane was on approach,
he swapped the crates.
We just had to guide the real gold out the door.
-[wind gusts] -[Abby] And Luke?
[Cyrus] He was never out.
He just had a different gig.
And all he had to do was guide it in for the safe landing.
So what did Huxley end up with?
Homeboy?
[Cyrus] He got nothing.
Come on. Let's go meet the team.
[laughing] Yeah!
Hey, hey, hey! Come here!
-[exclaims] We did it! -[Cyrus grunts]
[Cyrus] Oh! Our little fighter pilot!
-[Camila] That's me! -[Mi-Sun] Hey, you did it!
No, we. We did it.
-[Magnus] Luke! -[Luke] 'Sup!
Do you want to do the honors?
Oh no, no. I… I shouldn't even be here. [chuckles]
-Come on. -[Cyrus] You should.
-[Camila] Come on. -[Magnus] Do it. I'll do it.
[Mi-Sun] Do it.
-Yeah! -Right there.
-[Magnus] Here it is! -[laughs]
It worked. It worked.
Does it always feel this good?
It's never been this good.
-[Mi-Sun giggles] -Magnus, stop.
Welcome to the team, Agent Gladwell.
Oh please.
Call me Abby.
-Hey! -[Mi-Sun] Hey!
-[Luke] Welcome, Abby. -[Cyrus] That's a good job, guys!
-Come on. -All right.
-You get one. Just one. -Yeah!
[Cyrus] Good. Can we get our gold?
[man 2] It's not about Winky's Cantina.
[man 1] I like honey buns as much as the next guy. -I'm not gonna gouge your eye out for one. -[door shuts]
You gonna write that down? [man 2] I'm not gonna write anything down.
You want some gum?
What kind you got?
"Bubblicious Watermelon Wave." What do you say?
There is no other kind.
If you think I'm gonna rat somebody out for Bubblicious,
you got another thing coming to you.
Watermelon or not.
"Courtland Gentry. Born 1980."
"Incarcerated 1995."
"Eligible for parole in 2031."
You got a long way to go, son.
There's an upside to sleeping so close to your toilet.
I get it. You're glib.
Well, I'm just gonna cut to the chase.
My name is Donald Fitzroy, and I'm here to commute your sentence.
You're gonna commute my sentence?
-[Fitzroy] Yes. -Just like that?
When I get out of this chair and walk out of this prison, you'll walk with me.
Who are you, my fairy godmother? [laughing]
No offense, I thought you'd look different.
I may be. We'll see.
What's the catch?
You work for us.
-[Gentry] Who's "us"? -The CIA.
We're gonna train you to kill bad guys.
And since you've already killed one, it shouldn't be too difficult.
What makes you think I wanna do it again?
You seem like the type.
You'd be part of an elite unit, the Sierra program.
You would exist in the gray.
Disposable?
I've studied your case. I know why you pulled that trigger.
I would've done the same thing myself.
Now, I'm here to help you become a value-add instead of a value lost.
So why don't you take all the pain or whatever the hell got you here,
turn it around, and make it useful?
How long do I gotta work for you?
[Fitzroy] Let's just say you'd be indefinitely useful.
Do you need anything?
No, I'm good.
Nice suit.
I just wear what they tell me to.
Subtle.
You're no fly on the wall yourself.
I don't have a permit.
It's not that kind of party.
[dispatcher over radio] Six, you copy?
Six.
Six, copy.
Sir, I have him.
Six, this is Denny Carmichael, your center chief.
Our target, code name "Dining Car," is selling information
that could severely compromise national security.
We need him eliminated before that transaction is complete. Understood?
[Six] Understood.
Please explain to me why I'm talking to a Sierra agent
instead of somebody in our circle of trust.
There was no time to get one of ours over there.
Six was in the region,
and he happens to be historically good at the job.
Subject on approach.
[agent on radio] I have eyes on Dining Car.
[Denny] Target imminent.
Be advised, he's not alone.
[Denny] Dining Car has security.
Stay the plan.
[Denny] He's coming up on you now, Six.
[Denny] He's almost to you.
My friend. You made it.
Who are all these people?
[buyer] Future friends, future ex-wives.
[Dining Car] Get rid of them.
[buyer] Relax. Safer this way…
[Dining Car] Don't tell me to relax. I want my money.
So just transfer it and get it done.
Do you understand the risk I've taken by coming here?
You have no idea of the kind of people you're gonna have to deal with,
and they are gonna come for this.
Target acquired.
[Denny] Execute.
[Dining Car] Nothing stops them. They can get to anyone, anywhere.
[Denny] Six, why am I not hearing anything?
I'm picking up collateral.
There's a kid near the mark.
[Denny] You're cleared for collateral.
-[Denny] Go loud. -[buyer] Did you bring it?
[buyer] Let's talk price.
We have a very small window to take out a very bad dude.
Go loud, Six.
[crowd] Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one.
-Stand by. -[Denny] Do not stand by.
Gun jammed.
Aww, shit.
Let's move out.
Six, was that you?
[buyer] Where are you going?
-[Dining Car] Deal's off. -Six.
You know I know who you are.
You're Sierra Six.
They didn't tell you who I am, did they?
They never do.
I'm Sierra Four.
They sent you out to kill one of your own.
But that's probably not gonna make you walk away, is it?
Probably not.
If you're Sierra, who recruited you?
Fitzroy.
Same as you.
-[Six] Where'd you train? -[Dining Car] Dark site.
Tel Aviv. Same as you.
I got all the answers 'cause I'm telling the truth.
They're not.
Denny Carmichael is a piece of shit.
That's why I'm sitting here in my own blood.
-You're probably next. -[grunts]
Hey.
Take this
and bring the bastard down. [panting]
I don't want it.
You trust Carmichael?
Just… take it.
Please.
Okay, you know what?
There you go. I took it, okay?
You give 'em hell, Six.
Very discreet.
[Six] I thought this'd be cleaner.
[agent] It wasn't.
We're Romeo.
He said he was Sierra.
That wasn't in the mission folder.
He knew who I was.
[agent] Maybe he had access to stolen intel.
I'm Sierra. There is no intel.
[man] It's ours now, agent.
Agent.
I heard you.
I just chose to ignore you.
-[man 1] One wristwatch. -[man 2] Wristwatch.
-[man 1] R1, smartphone. -[man 2] R1, smartphone.
-[man 1] Money clip, lighter, pen. -[man 2] L1, money clip, pen, lighter.
[man 1] SSE complete. -[beeps] -[line ringing]
It's Dawson. I need Carmichael.
[Dawson] No joy. I repeat, no joy.
[Denny] This is why I wanted the Sierra program made extinct.
I want nothing left from that old regime.
These things take time, Denny. There are politics to unravel.
-[Denny] Get out. -What?
Get out.
-Six. -[Denny] Wanna explain whatever that was?
[Six] Gun jammed.
That doesn't qualify as an explanation.
[Six] Maybe on a secure line.
I need a status report.
Insecure line.
Did the target say anything to you?
Well, he was dead,
so, you know, no.
What about pocket litter? Did you get anything off his body?
Six, did he have anything on his person
that you now have that you'd like to give to me?
Who was he?
A bad guy.
-Carrying? -Bad shit.
Last chance, Six.
Understood.
Hey.
You a 42 regular?
Yeah.
Wheels up in five. Carmichael's been calling.
[Six] We spoke.
You should go without me.
You sure you wanna do that?
What happened with the target, Six?
Tell me what I don't know.
Well, that's the problem, isn't it?
[Six] Hey, pal.
Wanna trade?
[Fitzroy] Max's Fireplace and Barbecue.
You Max?
There is no Max.
-So it's like "to the max"? -Yeah.
Why didn't you just say that in the first place?
Because if something went wrong, I couldn't blame Max.
-How you doing, Fitz? -It's good to hear from you, kid.
How's life in retirement?
I'm headed to a funeral. Putting a friend in the ground.
I'm getting to that age, you know?
-You working? -[Six] I was.
-Got loud? -[Six] It got loud.
Got real weird too.
You know that guy that handed you your walking papers?
Yeah, Carmichael.
Well, brace yourself, but, uh, he might be sideways.
I'm shocked.
What's your gut?
My gut? It's gonna be my funeral you're going to next.
Give me an hour to find a local extraction team.
Get mobile. You may have to hustle.
Let me ask you a question. Four have a scar on his right chin?
Yeah.
-They just had me stick a fork in him. -Pretense?
Some foreign op bullshit. You know they don't tell me much.
He gave me something they really want.
On person?
No. Somewhere safe.
Good boy.
Well, I'll do some checking. I still have friends up the food chain.
-Where are ya? -Bangkok.
There's an airfield near Chiang Mai. Get to it. Watch your back.
You too.
Hey, Fitz,
I know there wasn't some palm trees 401k plan for me, but, uh,
I mean, at least tell me you guys had some kind of exit strategy.
We never got that far, kid.
And now, probably not.
Got it.
I'm sorry.
I'll be in touch.
Beats being on the wrong side of the bars.
Why is it always the last stall?
[Denny] Al Capone booth. I can see everything from here.
He blew off his exfil.
[Denny] Son of a--
-He's got it. -Not necessarily.
[Denny] Yes, necessarily.
That knuckle-dragger sweated me on the phone. He knows.
So…
Never should have touched Fitzroy's guys. They're all criminals.
[agent] You through?
What do you wanna do?
What we should have done from the start.
-No, no, absolutely not. -You had your shot. [exhales]
Lloyd Hansen is a sociopath.
-You say that like it's a bad thing. -It's a dangerous thing.
-He has methods. -Sociopathic methods.
So sit on him. The guy has a higher kill count than the entire Mossad.
I don't need Lloyd stable. I need him effective.
-[Lloyd] Should we try again? -[prisoner] No.
-Boring. -[electricity crackles]
"Mostly, it's loss
which teaches us about the worth of things."
That's Arthur Schopenhauer. He was a German philosopher, a pessimist.
-He saw the value in suffering. -[sobbing]
Damn it. Phones on silent when I'm working, please.
[guard] It's yours.
Who is it?
[guard] The chief.
Be right back.
Yeah.
-He talk yet? -[Lloyd] Still just flirting.
But…
he's getting there.
You watch the game on Saturday?
I turned it off at halftime. They ran us off the field.
Well, no one goes to Harvard to play football.
You did.
I like to be the exception. What's up?
Hand the jumper cables to somebody else. I got an urgent locate and destroy.
-Gimme a name. -[Denny] Sierra Six.
Could be fun. The man's got some street cred.
He got his hands on some compromising information,
the kind that could put us all in a cold, dark place.
So, get it back. Make him gone.
-Does the old man know about this? -Not yet. Heads would roll.
Well, I'm gonna need a full green light on this one. Open checkbook.
[Denny] Any means necessary.
And, Lloyd, I'm sending Suzanne to assist.
I'd rather you punch me in the dick.
I will gladly punch you in the dick, Lloyd.
All right, ladies, focus. Six is trained to be a ghost.
All right, ladies, focus. Six is trained to be a ghost. How do we find him?
-How close were he and Fitzroy? -Father-son kind of close.
Get me Fitzroy's file. -We'll find somebody he loves and squeeze. -[girl screaming]
[Denny] Do me right, Lloyd.
[Lloyd] Have I ever done you wrong, Denny?
Denny, that man is nothing but wrong.
Don't be a brat. He's gonna help you clean up your mess.
So now I'm the scapegoat?
I'm the boss.
You were the one who lost the asset in the first place.
And you couldn't get it back.
You know, the last person that pissed off the old man
ended up floating in the Potomac. If you like breathing,
you might wanna fix this.
[mercenary 1] Who's the extract?
[mercenary 2] You know better than to ask.
Fitzroy really likes this guy
or really wants him the hell out of Asia.
[mercenary 1] Heads up. [mercenary 2] Military-aged male, eleven o'clock.
[Six] You my ride?
Identity challenge. Heathen.
Response, hermit.
Need anything?
Just a nap.
[mercenary 2] Load 'em up.
[Dawson] Wheels up in two. Okay, hold on.
It's the chief. For you.
-[Denny] Agent Miranda? -Speaking.
Denny Carmichael. See that plane across the way?
[Miranda] Yeah. Hard to miss.
Get on it. You're meeting me in Berlin.
-I'm supposed to be in Singapore. -Not anymore.
-See you in Berlin. -[line clicks]
Hey, Fitz.
I know you?
Professionally maybe.
Lloyd Hansen, Hansen Government Services.
Rings a bell.
Aw, does it?
Good. You know my work. That'll make this next part a lot easier.
-Where is he? -Where's who?
-You really wanna do this? -Do what?
You know what makes me sad, Don?
Your small hands?
You spent your whole life basically building Sierra from the ground up,
and here you are, out to pasture, burying all your old buddies.
Remind me, Hansen, how long did you last at the agency?
-Six months? -Five and a half.
Bad ethics, zero impulse control, unsanctioned torture.
Something like that.
So how's the private sector treating ya? Does it pay as well as they say?
So how's the private sector treating ya? Does it pay as well as they say? Or do you spend most of your time strangling cats?
Who likes cats?
I like cats.
Let's talk about the mess your boy made.
-He doesn't make messes. -Oh, he made a big one.
And judging by your shallow breathing and puckered asshole,
I can only assume you know why I'm here.
He has his reasons.
I'm sure he does.
But see, that's the beauty of the private sector.
[whispers] I don't care about reasons.
My guess is you're helping him already.
So this shouldn't put too much of a dent in your day.
You know I can't find him, 'cause his file doesn't exist.
But your file,
well, that's chock-full of nuggets,
some of which might make you rethink your fussy attitude.
Now, I tried to get her to smile, but, uh…
you know kids.
Yeah.
[Fitzroy] You know the individual you're escorting?
-Mm-hmm. -I want him terminated.
Come again?
Keep the body and everything he has on his person.
Just make it painless, you understand?
Roger that.
Good boy, Fitz.
[pilot] We've had a loss of pressure in the cabin.
Put on emergency oxygen masks.
Repeat. Put on emergency oxygen masks.
[Lloyd] You gonna answer it?
Well, let's hope it's good news.
Speakerphone.
[Fitzroy] Hello.
[panting] It's me.
Where are you?
Emotionally?
I've been better.
The extraction team?
They've been better too.
Are you okay? You hurt?
You know what, Fitz?
I'm trying to figure out what answer it is that you want.
They leveraged me, kid.
They have my niece.
You hear me?
Hold on. You're breaking up.
[softly] Shit.
[Fitzroy] Hello?
Hello?
Okay, there you are.
Sounds like you're in a real pickle, Fitz.
Hey, sunshine. Lloyd Hansen here.
-I'm the one running this op. -What op?
The one where I get exactly what I want.
I'm a little unclear as to what that is.
Okay, that's fair. Well, why don't you come on in, and we can chat?
My assistant will get lunch. You like sushi?
No, I'm good. I… just had some Skittles.
Tell you what. Why don't we skip lunch,
you can give me the asset you stole,
and I won't have to chop your head off?
When you say things like "chop your head off,"
it makes you sound untrustworthy.
So, even if I had this thing, I'm not sure I would give it to you.
Oh, I think you would.
See, your old COS here has drawn way outside the lines.
Headquarters needs a scapegoat, and his neck is just about the right size.
Fitz is a big boy. He knows what business he's in.
-Hey, Lloyd. -Yeah?
I immediately don't like you.
Well, I'm glad we're on the same page.
Looks like you overplayed your hand.
Looks like you need a new phone.
-Let me give you a word of advice, Lloyd. -Hmm.
[Fitzroy] They say that life in its most unadorned expression
is a battle of wills.
Six's will is preternatural compared to yours.
Don't say "preternatural" to me.
It's an asshole word.
You're a child.
A child that's about to put a hit so big on your boy's head
that even his most loyal allies won't hesitate to drop a dime.
Every grade-A wet team from here to Reykjavík
will be vying for the prestige of killing the infamous Sierra Six.
I'll dig up every safe house he's ever stayed in.
I'll unearth every man or woman he's ever slept with.
Your boy won't be able to walk ten feet without getting his head blown off.
And that, Don, is exactly what bad ethics and zero impulse control will get you.
I can kill anybody.
Maybe not anybody.
Well, we'll see.
-You got a full bar on this thing? -Yes, sir.
[woman] Six.
Come.
Fitz, tell him why he's here.
[sighs] Okay.
I have a niece that I'm raising.
I know what line of work I'm in.
I want the kid to have a normal life, and Margaret's helped me give her one.
Any number of nefarious assholes would like to see him and his family dead.
Is there a point to this story?
Someone in the DC office
has accidentally leaked Fitz's address in Hong Kong.
-Bunch of idiots. -[Margaret] Indeed.
We've asked for agency security,
but for some curious reason,
Denny Carmichael won't supply it.
Fitz is starting a mission in Brazil tomorrow,
which means you are going to babysit.
[Fitzroy] My brother and his wife died about three years ago,
and to top it off, Claire was born with a heart condition.
Last month we put in a pacemaker,
and since then, she's been in and out of Mount St. Mary's.
Poor thing got dealt a brutal hand.
You guys taught me how to kill people, not care for them.
You don't have to care. Just keep her alive.
Claire, dear. This is Six.
He'll be looking after the house while Donald is away.
-[Six] Just the two exits? -Yes. That's right.
Six is an odd name.
Yeah. Yeah.
Just, uh, 007 was taken, so…
Are you chewing gum?
Yep.
We don't chew gum in this house.
I wasn't… briefed.
-Won't happen again. -[camera shutter clicks]
Hmm. Okay.
Well, I'll try and stay out of your way.
Do you mind?
May I?
Sure.
Thanks.
Nice to meet you.
[chewing] Excuse me.
[Claire] Looking for your jacket?
Looks like I sat on it.
Is that a secure phone?
Just got the high score.
I had a lot of time to practice after the operation.
They made me stay in bed.
"How long they make you stay in bed for?"
Quite a long time. Several weeks, actually.
"Oh, hope you're okay."
Better now, Six. Thanks for asking.
How's your time been here? Enjoying the grounds?
"Oh, they're lovely."
"I like to walk in circles and stare at my shoes."
Can I get that jacket?
[Claire] Like your tattoo.
Where'd you get it? Prison?
Yeah, actually.
[Claire, sarcastically] I'm shocked.
What's it mean, the writing?
Oh, it's, you know…
It's a guy's name in Greek.
-What guy? -[Six] Just a guy.
You know, trying to get a rock up a hill.
-Why? -They made him.
-[Claire] Who made him? -The gods.
Did they need a rock?
They were just trying to punish him, I think.
Did he deserve it?
Probably.
-[Claire] Did he like it? -Probably not.
So why'd he do it?
You ask a lot of questions.
You're quite the conversationalist.
I'm gonna get back to work.
Hey.
-Does he ever get to the top of the hill? -[chuckles]
I'll let you know.
Claire's asleep. I'm going out for a bite.
[Claire, strained] Mr. Six.
[gasps] Something's wrong.
[nurse] Start a bag…
[doctor] She's stabilized. Tell Donald there was a programming glitch.
We were able to repair it, non-invasive.
The remote system flagged it ten minutes before he pulled up.
We can keep track of her pacemaker from just about anywhere.
[guardian] Thank you. I'll let him know.
Donald…
-[Claire sighs] -You feeling better?
Just another Thursday.
[sighs] Donald says this is the best medicine,
ice cream.
Tend to agree.
He's a very smart man.
Only family I got.
Closest thing to family I got too.
Maybe that kind of makes us family.
-[yawns] -[Six] You should go to bed.
[guardian] All right, little one.
You heard the number. Let's go.
[Claire] Night, robot.
-[beeps] -[Six] Good night, Claire.
[Claire] Can I play a record?
Just one. and don't forget to brush your teeth.
[guardian, faintly] I'm going to start the tub.
[guardian, muffled] I'll take care of the cleanup, because you've had a very long day.
Is everything okay?
Yeah. Broke a bowl.
You sure you're all right?
[sighs] Yeah, just another Thursday.
You should go to bed.
Good night.
Night.
-[man speaks German] -[in English] I got dry cleaning.
-[man responds in German] -[Six] I want the works.
Starched, cleaned, pressed, and I want it same-day service.
Can you do it or what? [man in English] That's a very expensive laundry list.
You seem like a man who wants his shirts done right.
[Six] I'm in a bit of a hurry.
I'm also gonna need to get into a secure system.
[chuckles] Sure.
You really are the, uh, full buffet,
aren't you?
I do passports over there.
And, uh, well, let's do your… Let's do this thing first.
You can sit. You can sit here.
Where are you going?
It's… [sighs] What's… What's the secure system?
What's… What's the secure system?
Cormeum Electronics.
Cormeum…
Electronics, uh…
It's medical supplies.
Don't… Don't touch that door.
Yeah, I'm looking for a pacemaker.
I can get you a serial number.
That's all I need.
-Name? -[Six] Fitzroy.
Claire Fitzroy.
This will be a minute.
I'm getting that.
I think you should go get yourself cleaned up before we take your pictures.
Unless bloody and beaten is the kind of look you're going for.
[man] Know what happens when you get burned like that?
Your brain goes into shock.
I'm teaching you to fight through it.
Fight through the fear. Fight through the pain.
You master that, and you'll never lose again, son.
Cover that up, by the way. We don't need your mom seeing that.
Voilà.
-Already? -[man] Oh, yeah.
With this setup, I could read the Pope's diary
if I wanted to.
-[Six] Uh-huh. -Which I don't.
Uh, what, um, great nation would you like to hail from?
Denmark, New Zealand, Japan?
Non-extradition and palm trees would be nice.
You want Ecuador. Have you been there? [chuckles]
They have this, uh, this drink there.
It's called the, uh, the pinonilo.
Pinolillo.
And it's… They serve it with, uh, with honey.
Let me see the passport.
Yeah. With a very unselfish… There you are… Splash of honey.
And it's, uh… It's a must.
You cleaned up very well.
Like I said, I'm in a hurry.
Uh, you can stand over there.
Uh, you need an alias.
And it has to be something very, very easy to forget.
You can step on the rug.
Something like, you know, John, Joe.
Juan Pablo is also a very common name in Ecuador.
It has to… It has to disappear into the wash of the hippocampus.
Right between lunch and dinner.
-Let's go. -[man] Yeah.
I'm all talked out, all right? -Take the picture. -[man] Sure.
-Unless the desired response is emotion. -[camera shutter clicking]
Like, you know, hope, anger, fear.
Can you give a step towards me, please?
One step.
Yes, that's good.
The only problem with that sort of alias
is that emotional memory has staying power.
You know all about notoriety, don't you?
[spits, exhales] All right.
Trapdoor. Unexpected.
-Someone is very upset with you, man. -[continues coughing]
Well, now I'm upset with them.
A five and seven zeros' worth.
Hey!
-Smile. -[camera shutter clicks]
-They don't usually come this attractive. -That's called harassment.
If you think that's harassment, buckle up.
Tell me, what was your first clue Sierra Six was gonna break procedure?
When he didn't show at the exfil.
Not when he chased the target across a flotilla?
Six did his job until he didn't.
He intentionally blew an op
that was prepped to be executed at distance. I know. I prepped it.
And that whole time, you had no reason to believe
he had another agenda beside the op?
No.
Let's talk life goals, officer.
I went from Harvard, to analysis, to the DO's desk in eight years.
It's never been done before. I did it.
I did it by not allowing the weakness of others to drag me down.
Sierra Six stole an asset of considerable value to the agency.
If you had any idea this was coming and you withheld it,
your life goals, should you have any, would suffer incalculable damage.
I never even met Six until I landed in Bangkok.
And no one said anything about a retrieval. What's the asset?
-Do you know where Six is? -No.
Open that file.
In a career spanning two decades,
that's everything we have on your partner Six.
[mercenary] They found him.
Who's the closest to him?
[mercenary] We are.
What do you know about the Sierra program?
Reckless mystery men you guys send in
when you can't officially send anyone else.
The gray men.
Your predecessor's idea.
He founded a program to recruit hardened criminals,
commuting their sentences in exchange for a lifelong commitment to the agency.
Assets were chosen for their skill set, lack of family, and plausible deniability.
Identities permanently destroyed. Nameless assassins with limited morality.
I mean, what could possibly go wrong, right?
Every single Sierra flamed out.
All dead or back in prison.
Six is the last of the dirty half dozen, and he is 100% conforming to pattern.
[softly] He hurts people
because that's who he is.
That's who you're protecting.
Remove yourself from my personal space.
Please.
Officer, I have reason to believe you're not being truthful in this debrief.
And as such, I must recommend you be suspended from field duty.
I wanna talk to my COS.
I already did. She's lost confidence in you.
-[beeps] -Am I jarring your memory yet?
We need to ground in Vienna.
We haven't filed a flight plan. They'll never clear us.
So declare an emergency.
There are weapons on board. I'll lose my license.
We have a filed alternate near Budapest. Best I can do is call them.
How do you feel about your license?
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday, This is November Three…
Who's up for some Tafelspitz?
[Denny] Stick around the building.
The boys aren't done searching your apartment yet.
I would have opened it.
[whispers] Where's the target?
Where's my money?
[mercenary] He got caught in the well.
Come on, man.
Hey, sunshine.
-[grunts] You must be Lloyd. -What gave it away?
The white pants, the trash 'stache. It just…
-It leans Lloyd. -[sighs, chuckles]
Where's the drive?
I got it here somewhere. It's just hard to see.
-[clears throat] Is that it? -[clicks]
Ballsy.
Nice try, pumpkin.
What size shoe are you?
-Why? You want my foot in your ass? -[projectile whistles]
Ah, shit!
Mother--
Looks like an 11.
[Miranda] Who's this lunatic?
I don't know. Lloyd.
-Let's go. -[Six] I'm good.
Let's go.
It sounded like a question.
-How'd you find me? -You make a lot of noise.
Hey.
Open it.
-Not the trunk. -Get in.
I could really use a comfortable chair right now.
[whispers] Is that Donald Fitzroy?
What the hell are you doing?
[Lloyd] Suzanne! Long time. If I'm honest, I liked your old haircut.
Where you didn't look like a bitch.
We did not give you permission
to kidnap former CIA personnel and their family members.
You've been hired by the agency to recover--
To do your job because you couldn't.
Can someone get me a Vicodin, please?
-So where is Six? -Where I want him.
-In the wind? -On the run, scared shitless.
This is ten years of my work on the line here, Lloyd--
I am your only prayer of getting that drive back
because I can do everything the agency can't.
You know all those rules you guys are always trying to work your way around?
They don't mean dick to me.
So unless you want our names spilled across every news alert
on every phone in every pocket on Earth,
shut up and go sit in the corner.
How about that?
Forget about the Vicodin.
Why are you walking like that?
[Lloyd] 'Cause I got shot in the ass, Suzanne!
[Fitzroy] Hey, sweetheart.
-[Fitzroy] I'm so sorry. -[whimpers]
I know, honey.
I'm sorry.
-[sighs] -You look like shit.
That's the most sleep I've had in 36 hours.
They pulled me from field duty.
They think I'm into whatever you're into. You're gonna tell them I'm not.
What gives the impression they care what I think?
This is my career, you understand?
You're just an asset, but it's my career, my reputation.
What did you steal?
Technically, I didn't steal anything. Four gave it to me.
-Then why didn't you give it to HQ? -Well, he gave it to me.
-[Miranda] What did he give you? -An encrypted drive.
What's on it?
It's encrypted.
-I wanna see it. -I don't have it.
-Where is it? -How do I know I can trust you?
[Miranda] Because I just saved your life.
That's a fair point.
I sent it to Margaret Cahill, the U.K. Agency Chief, okay?
She retired and lives in Prague.
What are you thinking?
-[Miranda] I'm thinking about what to do. -Maybe think about it this way.
They already had me kill an agent.
Now it's my turn. How do you know you're not next?
Get comfortable.
"Get comfortable" like we're going to Prague, or… or, like, jail comfortable?
or… or, like, jail comfortable?
[Lloyd] Where are we? What do we got?
[tech] Wet teams en route.
Everybody be advised, he has help.
We sure?
Well, I didn't tranq myself in the ass, so yes.
[tech 2] Got something. CCTV in Bangkok. Night of the op.
[Suzanne] He ditched the asset.
-Where's that package now? -[tech 2] It's already in the system.
Resolution's too shitty to read the address.
Clerk said it was to a PO box in Prague.
He doesn't keep any records, so that's the best we got.
That'll do, pig. That'll do.
Goldilocks, would you be a lamb and excuse us?
Go to hell.
Hey! Whoa! Stop!
-She has a pacemaker, jackass! -[Claire] Hey, whoa!
Get off me! No! Stop!
Then she definitely shouldn't stick around for this next part.
If you hurt her, I will annihilate you. -Do you understand me? -[shushes]
-Please. -[grunts]
Who's in Prague?
There's three million people in Prague. I don't know all their names.
Right. Well, you see, your boy mailed a package,
which means, with countless contacts at his disposal,
and this being a particularly challenging situation,
there's someone in Prague that he trusts the most.
Who is that?
It's your mother.
[Lloyd] Boring.
Happy?
Now, whatever I just did to your ears, it's not even torture.
I just made it up on the spot. Just came to me.
-Oh. -[Lloyd] And that's how this is gonna go.
-Who's in Prague? -Nobody.
Boring.
-Should we try again? -Okay, fine.
Who's in Prague?
-I already told you, I don't know. -Boring.
Maybe we should get the girl back in here.
Yes.
Have you tried aluminum siding?
I prefer fiberglass.
At least you don't have to paint.
You're Berlin Station.
Until this morning.
I'm here with Six.
Where is he?
The trunk.
[approvingly] Well played.
You did say you were gonna quit.
It was a life of few pleasures.
I clung to the ones I had.
-"Was"? -[Margaret] Three months.
Optimistic.
If you utter anything remotely sympathetic,
I will shoot you.
Okay.
Have you been well enough to check your mail lately?
I have.
You get in?
I always get in.
Looks like Sierra Four got his hands on Denny Carmichael's dirty laundry.
-Assassination, torture, bombings. -[typing]
All unsanctioned
with no regard for collateral damage.
This is why Carmichael pushed me and Fitz out.
This is why you are on a ledge, Six.
He's using the agency as his own personal hit squad.
What's he getting out of all this?
[Margaret] This is shadow government stuff,
which, bluntly, it is above Carmichael's pay grade.
[Miranda] Guardian angel?
At least one.
Pushing him up the ladder, covering his tracks.
Somebody very powerful is pulling the strings.
How was Sierra Four involved?
[Margaret] Blackmail.
Four was always a hustler.
Looks like he found out about Carmichael, got ahold of some evidence,
tried selling it to the highest bidder.
Carmichael got wind of it and used Six to take him out.
Big mistake.
[Lloyd] Do not underestimate this target.
Hit this meatball like a freight train.
And turn on cams.
I want this pay-per-view.
[Miranda] There's no way we can copy the file?
[Margaret] It's a dead disk. You copy it, you encrypt the encryption.
Then we have to leak it to the press.
[Six] Wait until I find Fitz and the kid, would you?
There's a kid?
[Six] Fitzroy's niece.
But look, you've done more than enough. Just find cover. This is on me.
I wouldn't recommend it, but if you insist on a rescue mission…
My bug-out car.
It's bulletproof, loaded trunk.
Stashed in a garage in the city center. Address is on the tag.
Hey, inmate.
Thanks for proving us right.
I thought we weren't getting sentimental.
[Margaret] We're not.
[whispers] Go.
Okay, get in.
Lead. Lead. Light's on the left. I can't see.
Go!
[Six] Don't do this, Maggie. Open the door!
-Open the door. -[Margaret] Quiet.
[Margaret] In here.
In here.
In here!
[mercenary] Hands up.
-Where is he? -Where is who?
-[mercenary] Do not play with me. -What the hell is she doing?
[Margaret] Oh, doll,
whatever they are paying you,
it is not enough.
[mercenary] Oh, shi--
[Suzanne] Jesus.
Well, that was unexpected.
Did we just kill Margaret Cahill?
We have Alpha and Bravo teams circling.
Delta's en route. Cameras aren't live yet.
Send everyone. Get 'em in there, every team. Light it up.
Cops have him near the square at the opera house.
They've called in a SWAT team.
[in English] Hey, stop it! Don't move, okay? Stay still.
[tech 2] Alpha team arriving now.
This clown's a sitting duck.
You have my permission to shoot anyone standing in his way.
[mercenary] Confirmation on target.
Make him dead.
-You should clear the square. -[in English] Shut up.
-You should clear the square. -I told you to shut up.
We're going to prison for this.
Keep any more cops out of that square.
We're killing cops now? Margaret Cahill wasn't enough?
[tech 2] SWAT team approaching from the bridge. Multiple vehicles.
Six is in the southwest corner.
Get Bravo team in there. We need more guns.
Bravo engaging now.
[tech 2] Bravo, SWAT on your flank. Watch the fire from that heavy gun.
Would someone mind shooting the man handcuffed to the bench?
[mercenary] We can't get to him.
[mercenary] There's too many cops.
My God, how hard is it to shoot somebody?
Take out that assault vehicle.
This is insane.
Lloyd, please, pull everyone out now.
Lloyd!
Extra ten million to the first guy to put a bullet in this Ken doll's brain.
What happened?
The relay antenna must have snapped off.
Well, get it back on
before I beat you to death with that keyboard.
Anybody got eyes on him?
[mercenary] Negative, negative. We lost him.
He's on the tram!
[tech 2] Delta team's in pursuit.
Jump!
Thanks.
[Lloyd] All teams, report status.
All teams, report status.
This is quite possibly the most spectacular failure
in the history of covert ops.
This will be taught in schools as the primary example
of exactly what not to do in asset retrieval.
[man] This is Lone Wolf. Over.
Hello, my sexy Tamil friend.
Sit rep?
Tracking the target.
No change, Lone Wolf.
Get me that asset.
What I do can't be taught.
You hurt?
I mean, my ego's a little bruised.
I would like the opportunity to save you at some point.
Not that I want you to be in danger so I can save you.
-You said they have a girl. -Yeah.
How do we find her?
[Six] She's got a pacemaker.
You don't have a handcuff key, do you?
-Excuse me. -[woman] Yes.
Can you please get us a doctor? My husband's injured.
-You have to wait in the lobby. -No, we have been waiting.
-I'm sorry. -[Miranda] I need someone to see him now.
[woman] I understand.
[Miranda] How much longer do we need to wait?
You know, you have ten fingers.
Yeah, and a few cans of pepper spray in my eyes.
And you can't all caps on this thing. You have to control shift. It's a process.
There.
She's in Croatia.
I mean, I can see that.
It's not in Croatian.
We need a ride. I call not trunk.
And you are?
Give it to me.
-[Miranda exhales] -You wanna go first?
You go.
Help. Help me.
[Lone Wolf] That's him, the man from the square. He's trying to kill me. He's got a gun.
-[officers shouting in Czech] -Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
-[officers continue shouting] -[Lone Wolf] Okay, okay.
Hey! Give me the gun.
Get down!
[Six] You were in my shot.
You gave me an empty gun?
-[Six] The shells were coming, okay? -Huh?
The shells were coming. You… You ran away too fast.
[Miranda] Then you need to say, "Hey, wait! That's empty."
No, it's assumed.
I assumed it's loaded, so I ran after the guy.
-Who throws a loaded gun? -I asked for a loaded gun.
No one throws a loaded weapon, okay? Are you coming?
I'm gonna bleed out while we have this conversation.
Can we just unpack this somewhere else?
[Denny, over phone] Jesus Christ, Suzanne!
I warned you.
When I said, "Sit on Lloyd," I meant sit on him,
not "torch half of Europe."
-He is unsittable. -Do you have the drive?
Not in possession. No, it's en route.
What about Six?
Bleeding and MIA.
-Have you heard from the old man? -No, not yet.
Doesn't mean he doesn't know. "Prague on fire" is hard to keep a lid on.
What are you gonna tell him?
The truth, Suzanne.
That you hired Lloyd Hansen?
That truth or some other truth?
Call me the minute you get the drive.
[Six] What are you doing?
I'm just gonna pack it and wrap it,
and we can go.
[panting] EpiPens.
Good news is he missed the liver and the kidney.
Amateur.
Why'd you go to prison?
Why do you ask?
'Cause I wanna know.
[Six] Will it affect whether you help me or not?
[Miranda] Maybe.
That's fair enough.
What is this, puppy mouthwash?
Okay.
Well… [sniffs]
…my father fancied himself a real macho man.
And he was hell-bent on turning me and my brother into the same.
Unfortunately, his methods were a little unsound,
and, uh…
he started laying into my brother so hard
that at a certain point,
it was clear it was either gonna be my brother or him.
So…
I decided it would be him.
I thought, "How noble of me,"
and, uh, everyone else thought I should be in jail.
And that's the way it was until Fitzroy found me.
That's better.
So what do you say?
We gonna do this or not?
He's coming for us, isn't he?
If he can walk, honey, it'll be through those double doors over there.
-[typing] -[pilot] Vehicle on approach.
Let him in.
Alpha one, clear.
Charles trois, clear.
[Lloyd] You know what I love about you?
You look like you've been hit by a bus, but it only adds to your mystique.
Yahtzee.
-Eh, à cause de-- -[Six] You guys looking for me?
All right, all right, you got me.
-[mercenary] Mets-toi à genoux ! -Quick question.
You a 42 regular?
[Miranda] If you're gonna take his gun, make sure it's loaded.
I get the big one.
It's loading.
Tell me, Suzanne, is there any other part of your job that I can do for you?
Failing upwards does not qualify as success.
No, success qualifies as success.
Do you consider putting a bullet in the girl upstairs a success?
'Cause I'm struggling to see how you're gonna get out of all this.
You wanna make an omelet, you gotta kill some people.
You're killing a girl?
You know, in English, we call this a happy ending.
However, if you say one more word, you may not see it that way.
Suzanne, please pay my Tamil friend and send him on his way.
Who's on the east perimeter?
[tech 2] Unit five.
Where are they?
They were there two minutes ago.
Get the genny up.
Lock everything down.
All units to the courtyard.
And do not pay this asshole.
[Claire] What's happening?
I told you to stay over there, please.
-[Claire] What's going on? -[gunfire]
Under the bed, quick!
[sighs] Attaboy.
Fitz.
Get me eyes on the bridge.
He's trying to draw us away. Shit!
You able?
Well, I can walk, but, uh, missing a wing.
-Can you wiggle your finger? -With this wing.
[Six] That'll do. You okay?
Took you long enough.
-Sorry about that. My flight was delayed. -[Fitzroy] I knew you'd catch another one.
[whispers] Put these in your ears.
You ready?
He's in the house.
Morons!
-[tech] Alpha team, check in. -[personnel clamoring]
[tech] All elements check in.
-Put a gun on that door. -[man 2] Roger that.
-[tech 2] Check the network. -[tech] It's unresponsive.
[tech 2] Get the cameras back on.
I had to reboot the system.
-[tech] Mine is not rebooting. -[tech 2] Mine's unresponsive.
Shit!
Do you have a plan, or are we improvising?
Yeah, I got a plan. You got your swim trunks?
[Fitzroy] Go, go, go.
-Down. Down low. -[Claire gasps]
You're making me destroy a historic building here!
All right. Let's get ready to jump.
-I'm gonna have to take the stairs. -What are you talking about?
-[Claire sobbing] -[Fitzroy] Not good.
-What the hell is that? -What do you think it is?
-Go, Six. Get her out of here. -[growls]
[Fitzroy] Take the gun. Give me the grenade.
-Let me see it. Put some pressure on it. -[Fitzroy mutters]
Get the damn gun out of my face. Shut up. I need to think.
You don't have time to think.
Six, look at me. Look at me.
I'm out.
Get her gone.
Take this. Give me a hand grenade. You understand me? Go!
-Come on. -You go with Six, baby.
-[Six] We go in three, two, one. -[Claire] No, wait!
-He's bleeding. Oh, my God! -[Six] Come on.
-I love you. Go with Six. -No!
-Not you too! -Go, go, go, go. Take her.
-It's okay. -[Claire] No. Six, stop!
Stop it! Stop!
[Claire sobbing] Six, please!
Oh, for Chrissakes.
[Lloyd] Roll him.
Boring.
-You douche. -[gasps]
-No! No! [sobbing] -Come on.
Take it.
I don't care about the money anymore.
These are not honorable people. Take it.
Stay down.
[shouts] Shoot him!
[grunts, gasps] Wait. Please don't shoot.
Look what you did to my hand. Give me that, you little shit.
-[Lloyd] Hey, hey! -[exclaims]
Now you pick those feet up, or you're gonna get dead real quick.
[panting] Now, listen.
You shut up, and you don't move.
[Claire] Six!
[Lloyd] Now, I'm gonna stop you right there, cupcake.
What do you say we wrap this up?
I mean, I'm having a blast,
but it's way past the kid's bedtime, don't you think?
Keep him talking. I have line of sight.
You're gonna throw me that gun, or the little one gets a new face.
If your strategy relies on whether or not I'll kill a child,
you need a new strategy.
Cute. I meant with the bullets.
Nobody throws a loaded gun, Lloyd.
You know, I think we would have been friends, you and I.
Aside from your childish sense of morality and eight-dollar haircut,
we have a lot in common. It's really a shame this isn't gonna work out between us.
Now normally at this point in the night, I wouldn't be sticking around.
With the house lights about to come on,
I'd find a desperate, ugly chick to lick my wounds and split,
but you have been a pebble in my shoe since the very beginning.
And now I just don't think I can walk away.
Guess what I'm thinking right now.
That you've overshared.
I think I'm better than you.
What do you say, Six, you wanna dance?
Push him right, and I'll have the shot.
-Forget the shot. Come get the kid. -[Claire sobbing]
Let me see your face.
My friend's gonna meet you at the edge of the maze, okay?
-No, no, wait. -[Six] Yeah.
Wait, I'm not just gonna leave you here with him. He's crazy.
-I got this. -No, no. I'm gonna take you with me.
Just come with me, please. -Claire. -Don't leave me alone.
-Please. -Claire. Claire.
-You're all I have. -[Six] Claire. Claire.
-Claire. -[sobs]
This is just another Thursday.
[Six whispers] Go.
Kick his ass.
Do you miss your fingers, Lloyd?
Still getting used to it.
Damn! That stings!
Let's see if these moves fuck.
Don't ever talk back to me, you understand?
-[sizzling] -Ever.
I will end you.
And you are?
-Relax. -[Six groans]
You'll live.
I just need you compliant.
Can I comply over there?
[Suzanne] Knock yourself out.
-[Suzanne sighs] I mean, look. -[Six groans] Lloyd Hansen was a toxic piece of shit, right?
Yeah, that's right.
We have history.
Me, Denny, Lloyd, we all went to Harvard together. -[groans] -Those two had this absurd bromance.
-[groans] -Those two had this absurd bromance.
Which made it impossible for me
to prove to Denny how much of a liability Lloyd was.
Then I see you two troglodytes bashing each other.
The whole thing just crystallized.
Lloyd Hansen is gonna posthumously take the fall
for everything that has happened.
Now, I know how to do that.
What I need are a few witnesses to corroborate my story.
So if you want that girl to live to a ripe old age,
you are gonna do exactly what I tell you to.
Bad news is you'll probably get your old cell back,
but the good news is, if you behave, I'll let you out to play sometimes.
'Cause frankly, you are freakishly good at what you do.
What? Do you have a question? What is that?
Does this plan involve me living?
-Yes. Yeah, you're gonna live. -[Six] Then we should go.
Lot of blood.
Lot of blood.
[man] This will forever be remembered
as one of the darker chapters in the history of this agency.
That a rogue independent contractor as morally dubious as Lloyd Hansen
could literally steal company resources
to commit crimes against our allied partners,
this is… this is a black eye on all of us.
I don't know how to defend it.
However, after much deliberation,
and based on your corroborative depiction of events,
this committee and myself have decided
to exonerate the three of you in this affair.
I don't wanna see you back in here for quite some time. Is that understood?
-[Suzanne] Understood. -[Denny] Understood, sir.
-You did the right thing. Good work. -Thank you, sir. Really.
Clever girl.
Stick to the script.
If anything ever happens to Claire Fitzroy, deal's off.
I will come for you.
Please,
remove yourself from my personal space.
-[gasps] -Lunch.
Let's go.
Where are they keeping Six?
Basement. Most secure floor.
Should've put a bullet in his head.
He tore through 30 of the best operatives in the world.
Why would I waste an asset like that?
He's Fitz's gray man. He's not gonna do anything you say.
He will. As long as I have the girl, he will.
It is very dangerous for you to start thinking for yourself.
You threatened, Denny?
How pleasantly out of character.
-You rather I be floating in the Potomac? -I got Lloyd's autopsy report.
-You rather I be floating in the Potomac? -I got Lloyd's autopsy report. They pulled a nine millimeter from his chest.
I told you Six got my gun.
-Killed Lloyd, left you alive? -That's right.
Guess he didn't perceive you as a threat.
That would be his mistake.
[Denny] What's Six's current condition?
He's been unresponsive the last few days.
What do you mean "unresponsive"?
He just lays there. Can't tell if it's psyops or medical.
Won't eat. Won't speak. Won't even look at us.
Brain damage?
Nothing shows up on a scan.
Oh, shit.
-[soldier] Clear right. -Room clear.
Lock down the perimeter. Six is a runner. Repeat, Six is a runner.
-With me. -[soldier] Yes, ma'am.
When do I get to go home?
I asked you a question.
Like, so differently.
His name is Miles Morales.
He was bitten by a radioactive spider.
And he's not the only one.
He hasn't always had it easy.
And he's not the only one.
And now he's on his own.
And he's not the only one.
You think you know the rest.
You don't.
I thought I knew the rest, but I didn't.
I didn't wanna hurt him.
But I did.
And he's not the only one.
[Glory] Hey!
Yo, Def Leppard!
Gwen!
Is the song over? -Seems over. -[Glory] Are you okay?
-Seems over. -[Glory] Are you okay? You don't hang out, and you don't wanna talk.
I didn't join a band -so I could talk about feelings. -I did.
-so I could talk about feelings. -I did.
I joined it so I could hit my feelings with sticks.
Yo, if you don't tell someone what's going on, -you're gonna snap. -I'm fine.
-you're gonna snap. -I'm fine.
That's not how someone who's fine would say that.
They'd say, "Great. Thanks. How are you?"
-I'm great. Thanks. -Whoa!
How are you?
Fine?
Gwen. Come on.
-I don't get you, man. -You're right!
I play drums.
I always wanted to be in a band.
Guess I just never found the right one.
In this line of work,
you always wind up a solo act.
Before Miles... -How many did you take? -...there was Peter.
-I think you look great. I don't know. -Is this that dangerous menace?
No, no, no. She seems like a good guy.
Why wear a mask if you've got nothing to hide?
All right, no politics at the dinner table.
Thank you, May.
But they didn't really know me.
-And I didn't really know him either. -[grunts]
-Touch him again, Ned. -[Peter] Gwen, it's okay.
[Gwen] Until it was too late.
-[woman] Hey, Gwen. -Hey.
[Gwen] Peter?
[Gwen] What? No.
No, no, no.
What did you do?
I just wanted to be special.
Like you...
Gwen.
-[Gwen] Gwen? -Don't worry.
[Gwen] Who's Gwen?
Everything's gonna be okay.
Don't.
-Everything's gonna... -Don't go.
Oh, Peter.
-[George] Hey, hey! Hey! -[gun cocks]
Peter?
[Gwen] I never really made another friend after that.
Except one.
But he's not here.
And there's no way to get there.
[Jonah] Pressure mounts as Captain George Stacy leads the manhunt for Spider-Woman.
Who is she? And why won't she show her face?
Peter Parker, an innocent young man...
Peter Parker, an innocent young man... I've known May and Ben Parker for 12 years.
Peter Parker ate at my table.
He was my daughter's best friend.
And I will not rest
until I find this Spider-Woman.
Hey, hey, hey. How's the band?
Uh... Uh, yeah, great. I quit so, you know...
Uh... Uh, yeah, great. I quit so, you know... -You did, huh? Okay. -...thumbs up.
We, uh-- We caught a break in the Spider-Woman case.
That's good.
We're close. I'm telling you, I can feel it.
[Gwen clears throat] Me too.
[sighs] It'll be good for us.
Don't be so sure.
She killed your friend.
-You don't know that. -What do you mean? I do know that.
-I was there. She ran from the scene. -Maybe she didn't have a choice.
-I got a job to do, Gwen. -It won't bring him back.
Uh, I don't wanna argue about this, okay?
Yeah, I can tell.
Say, uh...
too punk rock to give your old man a hug?
[woman 1 over radio] All units, possible superhuman event.
-Guggenheim Museum. -Oh. Hey, this could be it.
Suspect is Adrian Toomes. Also known as the Vulture.
-So I'll see you later? -We don't know the full scale
-of the threat yet. -Cool.
Uh, I'll call. I love you.
[woman 2] 49-20, on scene.
We're gonna need all the help we can get. It's a real mess down here.
This is Captain Stacy. I'm five out.
I need you to look alive. Good chance our girl shows up.
Yuri, explain to me how a guy with a 40-foot wingspan
just waltzed into the Guggenheim unnoticed?
Hey, it's New York. Everyone's got their thing.
-Do we know what he wants? -Do you speak Italian?
-Uh, I'm an Irish cop. -Maybe you love pasta or something.
Everybody on my signal!
-[officers yelp] -Look out for signs of Spider-Woman!
Hey! [grunts]
Yup, we got our sign.
[in deep voice] How's the manhunt for me going? -[muffled] You're under arrest! -Good to know!
-[muffled] You're under arrest! -Good to know!
[in normal voice] Vulture!
-Screaming their name usually works. -[yells]
I guess that worked.
[in English] I am the Vulture, the pinnacle of man's genius.
You're not my Vulture. What are you, made of parchment?
-What cursed world have you brought me to? -[unsettling music playing]
[Gwen] You're glitching, huh? Been there.
-Uh, where you from, bud? -I am an artist, an engineer.
Oh, great. A Renaissance man.
Ooh, let me guess.
You were having an espresso
in some old-timey Leonardo da Vinci dimension,
and suddenly a portal opens up and you wind up here.
-[lively music playing] -[groans]
-Am I warm? -Yes, that's pretty much it.
[Gwen grunts] Sidebar, uh, maybe you could stop making a mess of the art museum for no reason?
-You call this art? -We're talking about it, aren't we?
-[man] Oh, that's cool. -[Vulture yells]
[Gwen] I mean, it's more of a meta commentary on what we call art,
but it's also art.
Oh, look. It's your cousin.
[Gwen] I wouldn't play with fire, dude. You're kind of made of paper.
-[laughs] -Oh, no.
I'm sorry. Who exactly are you supposed to be?
It's classified.
-You're the Blue Panther. -No.
-The Caped Blusader? -No.
-Dark Garfield. -Stop.
Macho Libre.
I'm from another dimension.
You are? Wow! Actually, I'm not confused.
Wow! Actually, I'm not confused.
-My name is Miguel O'Hara. -[dramatic music playing]
I lead an elite strike force dedicated to the security of the multiverse--
-Actually, forget it. -[music stops]
Can you go to any dimension you want with that watch thing?
-It's much cooler than a watch. -Okay. Sensitive.
There is a big flying turkey from the Renaissance I have to bring to justice, so if you don't mind...
I have to bring to justice, so if you don't mind...
[Miguel] It's all right, kid.
I'll take it from here.
[Gwen] Okay, knock yourself out.
[Miguel] Why are you saying it like that?
-[grunts] You're not funny! -[Gwen] Eh, I don't know.
[Miguel] Been really fun cleaning up your shocking mess, by the way.
[Gwen] What mess? -[Miguel] Kingpin's collider. -What are you guys talking about?
-[Miguel] Kingpin's collider. -What are you guys talking about?
-You shut up. -None of your business. Nosy. We saved the multiverse.
We saved the multiverse.
[Miguel] You left a hole wide enough for guys like him
to randomly get shot into the wrong dimension.
Now I'm stuck putting everybody back where they belong
before all of time and space collapses.
And don't even get me started on Doctor Strange
and the little nerd back on Earth-199999.
[Gwen] Who's Doctor Strange? Sounds like he maybe shouldn't practice medicine.
-Sorry, captain, can't talk right now. -Hey! Hey!
[Gwen] So you want me to handle this one or...?
Huh. Okay.
[in English] He's got hammerspace!
[Miguel] LYLA, can you please, you know...?
-Nah, you gotta say it first. -[sighs]
-Call for backup. -What?
-Call backup. -Come on.
-Please just call for-- -I already called her.
-Agh! -But I enjoyed that.
Spider-Woman.
Me too.
Are you, uh...?
Oh, this?
We don't know the sex yet. My husband wants it to be a surprise.
[laughs] He's really corny. But so hot.
Will you adopt me?
-What? -What? What?
[Miguel] Guys, can we focus on the big, fire-breathing threat to time and space, please?
-Yep, yep, yep. -[Gwen] Right.
-What about her? -No.
-We could use the help. -No.
-'Cause she called you Dark Garfield? -No.
-Do you say anything but no? -No. Yes.
-Why not? -You know why.
[in English] Enough of this.
Take a good look at my Greek fire from my backpack.
[Miguel] Don't let him out!
He'll disrupt the canon.
-[man] Go to the ground. -Will you get out of here?
[man] We have you surrounded.
-[Miguel] But I'm a good guy. -[man] You don't look like a good guy.
[Miguel] You're just gonna have to shut up and trust me. No!
[man] Mayday! Mayday! We're hit!
Clear the building!
[man] Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.
That's what I was gonna do.
-[groans] -Hands in the air!
Captain, come on.
-Suspect is armed. -With what? I'm out of webs.
Get down on the ground.
Which is it? Hands in the air or get down on the ground?
-You're under arrest. -I just saved a bunch of people!
-For the murder of Peter Parker. -Come on.
-You have the right to remain silent. -You don't understand!
[George] You don't understand.
Dad.
I've thought about telling you. But you can see why I didn't want to. You can see why I didn't wanna tell you.
But you can see why I didn't want to. You can see why I didn't wanna tell you.
I didn't murder Peter.
I didn't know it was him. I didn't have a choice.
How long have you been lying to me?
Can you just not be a cop for a second and be my dad here and listen to me?
Do you really think I'm a murderer?
You're in this to help people, right?
Right?
Well, so am I.
And the way to help right now is to listen to me.
Please, Dad.
You're all I have left.
-You have the right to remain silent. -What?
Anything you say can and will...
Dad, are you really this afraid of me?
-You have the right to an attorney. -Dad, stop!
Don't get any closer.
Hey! What--?
-Dad! -Hey, hey, hey. Come on.
Just breathe.
We got you. Right, Miguel?
LYLA, scan this mess.
No further anomalies.
Canon remains intact.
[Jess] We can't just leave her here. She's doing this on her own.
I don't know how to fix this.
[Miguel] Yeah.
Well, join the club.
[woman] I know he's just a sophomore,
but we wanna get a jump on the college conversation, so...
I'm sure he's gonna be here any minute.
He's very serious about his future. [chuckles]
-Excuse me, do you have an ATM machine? -Around there in the back.
Preferably not chained.
-[Lenny] What? -[Spot] Nothing!
This should be simple enough.
Just make a hole...
grab the money.
Nope. That's not right.
Just get... Uh-- [grunts]
Give me your money.
Where are you, money? Where are you?
Come here! Oh! [grunting]
[man] Hey, who left this ATM on the sidewalk?
-Yo, what you doing back there, man? -Nothing.
Nothing. Everything's cool, man. It's all good.
-Just forgot my PIN number. -Get out of here!
-No! Sir! Let me rob you! -I'm going to rob your spotted face.
-No! Sir! Let me rob you! -I'm going to rob your spotted face. [Spot] No reason to bring wood into this.
I've never robbed anybody in my life. Please don't make this a bad experience.
[Lenny] "Bad experience"? I run a business here.
[Spot] I'm like Robin Hood, if he gave to himself.
Oh, wow, is this curry powder? See, I'm a scientist. Or I wa-- I am.
Anyway, you've heard of Alchemax? I used to work there.
I was considered handsome by scientists' standards.
I had a little accident. [yelps]
[grunts] Give me my foot!
Oh, man.
I'm so sorry. First of all, I'm not even robbing you. This machine doesn't even belong to you.
First of all, I'm not even robbing you. This machine doesn't even belong to you.
-Belongs to the bank, the real criminals. -You're the criminal. You're robbing me.
You know, I can't really get a job anywhere anymore, being like this.
So I've turned to a life of crime.
-Why do people say "ATM machine"? -[Spot] Huh?
-Who said that? -The M stands for "Machine."
Spider-Man! [yelps]
Hey, Lenny, how much do I owe you for this beef patty, man?
Spidey, if you catch him, it's on the house, brother.
-This is real! -So are you, like, a cow or a Dalmatian?
I am...
...the Spot.
-[laughing] -We meet again, Spider-Man.
-That's funny to you? -Of course not. No.
So is that a costume?
Unfortunately for both of us, this is skin.
Oh, dang.
[Spot] You see... -I'm from your past. One year ago-- -[dramatic music builds, then stops]
-I'm from your past. One year ago-- -[dramatic music builds, then stops]
-[cell phone buzzes] -Hold up. -Oh, come on. -[Miles] Uh-oh.
-Oh, come on. -[Miles] Uh-oh.
-This has been fun. -Who you talking to? -But I really gotta wrap this up. -Are you gonna be a while? 'Cause--
-But I really gotta wrap this up. -Are you gonna be a while? 'Cause--
Maybe just pay me now.
[Miles] Okay, let's do this one last time.
-My name is Miles Morales. -[lively music playing]
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.
And for the last year and four months,
I've been Brooklyn's one and only Spider-Man.
And things are going great.
-Hey, hey, hey! -[people scream] You could hurt somebody.
Catching all sorts of bad guys.
Let's go. [Miles laughs, then grunts] Oh!
Can't you act like a regular supervillain so I can catch you?
I designed my new suit with some fly ambience down the side.
Aunt May moved to Florida.
Done.
I guest-hosted Jeopardy!
Endorsed baby powder. Apologized for endorsing baby powder.
I made a mistake.
My mustache came in.
[deep voice] Mustache.
[Miles] And out.
I made another mistake.
Been developing a new twist on my venom thing.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Sorry!
How much longer can I keep lying about who I really am?
I hear that new Spider-Man is Puerto Rican.
[laughs] Nah, he seems more Dominican to me.
I mean, would they get it if I told them?
We love you and accept you, even though you have been lying to us for a year.
[Miles] Maybe in some other universe.
Sometimes I just wish I wasn't the only one.
But I don't dwell on it.
I miss my uncle sometimes.
Miles, I see exactly what you're doing there, man.
[Miles] Even though he turned out to be the Prowler.
I try to do what he told me:
Just keep going.
[Miles] "Just keep going."
[Spot] You're looking at texts? This is the fight of our lives.
-Sorry. Just a second. -Okay.
No, no, no. Go ahead. Take the call.
You turn off your phone in a theater, but not when you're fighting me?
[Jeff] Ah! "In a minute."
Ah! He wrote it all as one word. That's cute, right? The youth.
-[Miles] Okay, that's weird. -Whoa!
[grunting] Oh, my nose!
[Miles] Sorry. I gotta be somewhere.
-Psych. -Whoa! [yelling]
[chuckles] There's bubbles now. Hold on.
Whoa!
[Spot yelps] I think this is going great.
Still bubbles on here.
I think it's probably okay.
[Spot] I love it.
We're figuring it out. We're finding our rhythm.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[Spot] Hey, where'd that goose come from? Whoa!
I don't think I want this costume anymore.
Almost there, Mami.
-Smiley-face. Prayer hands. -[Spot] Oh, my God.
Is this your goo--? Get it off me, get it off me!
Is this your goo--? Get it off me, get it off me! -[Spot grunts] -[Miles yelps]
[Miles] At the end of the day...
[Spot] I got you right where I-- Ow!
So aggressive!
...I'm Spider-Man. No one can take that away from me.
[Spot] Unbelievable. Come back to your nemesis!
Don't escape.
Your costume's too tight in the back, by the way.
-Yo, what's up, man? -Uh, I'm writing an essay.
There's a bad guy on the Petersen building.
Call the police, tell them to pick him up?
-Sounds like a slippery slope. -Just this one time.
It starts with one call, then it's walkie-talkies, synchronized watches.
In a month, it'll be a Spider-Signal. I'm not your "guy in the chair."
Are those my Jordans?
I can't help it if we're the same size.
You see, every person is a universe.
And my job is to capture your person's universe
on this piece of paper.
-That's blank. -Exactly.
I have no idea who this kid is.
I don't know if he knows.
He's gotta decide if he's going to commit himself to his future
or whatever he's doing instead of being here.
Can't have your cake and eat it too.
Unless you bake two cakes.
Unless you bake two cakes. -Miles? -Interest in comedy.
-How's this going? College! -Now, son, what do we always say?
"On time means five minutes early."
I know, I know, I know.
I gotta get back to being a great student, so can we make this quick?
[Ms. Weber] Okay.
Miles's grades are pretty good.
A in AP Physics...
That's my little man.
...and AP Studio Art.
He takes after his uncle.
-A-minus in English. -She's a tough grader.
And a B in Spanish.
-What?! -Whoo! Okay.
-Miles! [speaks in Spanish] -Are you trying to kill your mother?
[speaks in Spanish] Eso no es my fault.
"Esto no es my fault"? ¿Tú estás tomando la clase en Spanglish?
I missed a few classes.
Oh, just a few classes. Well, what's "a few"?
[Miles] I mean, you know, like... -Five? -[in unison] Five?!
-Five? -[in unison] Five?!
Actually, six.
-You're dead. -A truant.
-Wait. -[sighs] Takes after his uncle.
-But I just have a lot going on. -All right. We can still salvage this.
I'm sorry, "salvage"?
Miles has a great story to tell.
Having a story at all seems gross.
-Your name is Miles Morales. -Correct.
You grew up in a struggling immigrant family.
I'm from Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is part of America.
We own a floor in Brooklyn. Ah... Struggling? [muttering]
We own a floor in Brooklyn. Ah... Struggling? [muttering] -Doesn't matter. You're all struggling. -I make captain next week.
-Doesn't matter. You're all struggling. -I make captain next week.
Now his dream is to attend the top physics program in the nation...
-Whatever it takes, we'll do it. -...at Princeton University.
In New Jersey?
No, no, no. That's too far.
New Jersey's too far from New York?
There's great schools in Brooklyn.
Mom, Princeton has the best quantum researchers in the country.
Quantum. Mm-hm.
They're moving electrons across dimensional thresholds.
-Electrons. Uh-huh. -They're studying dark matter!
I don't know what any of that means.
I could help figure out how to travel to other dimensions.
-Yeah, okay. -That sounds like a really good fake job.
Dad, when you were my age, you followed your dream
and went out on your own to start a business with Uncle Aaron.
-Right? -That's different. We used to--
-Right? -That's different. We used to-- See, when you were born-- [laughs] Plus, your mom used to--
See, when you were born-- [laughs] Plus, your mom used to--
Look, life is a journey.
You all got me into this school because you thought I could do something special.
-[dramatic, pensive music playing] -And now I think so too.
And the special thing I wanna do is this.
There are people out there
who can literally teach me the things I wanna learn.
But they aren't all in Brooklyn.
That's your story!
Now just stick to the script.
[Jeff] Miles, are you paying attention?
-Miles, pay attention. -[Spot whoops]
-Ow. That hurt my tailbone. -[Miles] Are you kidding me?
Ooh. I gotta go. You guys keep talking. This is all great stuff.
Miles, wait. Did you order the cake for tonight?
Totally. I'm-- You know, call me-- I gotta go, all right? Bye!
This kid. I swear, what are we gonna do with him?
[man] All units, supervillain event in progress.
-I gotta go too. -What? You're gonna leave too?
He leaves, you leave, everybody leaves. Why am I here?
I know. I'm so sorry. But we'll figure it out.
Together.
Wow. Excuse me, I'm so sorry.
-[Ms. Weber] He's lying to you. -Jeff?
Your son.
He's lying. And I think you know it.
How's your essay?
-Marinating. This is part of my process. -Oh? Oh, really?
-I think your guy got away. -Thanks, I'm on it.
-You seem really stressed. -[Miles] I agree.
-You're stretched too thin. -Yeah, thanks for the tip. [yelps]
-That was bad. -[Jeff] I know.
-What's really going on with this kid? -I don't know!
-Oh! Hey! -[Spot] Boom!
-Spider-Man. -[Miles] Officer Morales! I mean:
-[in deep voice] Officer Morales. -[Spot] This is not what it looks like.
-Hey! Hey! -[Spot] Officer-- My kid goes here, man!
My kid goes here, man!
[Spot] This is fun.
I'm on the PTA. You know how many lemon bars I gotta bake for that?
-[Spot] You left in the middle of a fight. -[Miles] I did not. It was at the end.
-[Jeff] Are you serious? -[Spot] It was inconsiderate, super rude. And a little cocky.
Yeah, you got me agreeing with the bad guy right now.
[Miles] "Bad guy"? He's barely a villain of the week.
What'd you call me?
-You realize I'm right here. -Come on!
-[Miles] Everything... -[Jeff yells]
...is under control.
-[Jeff groans] Unbelievable. -[Spot] Wow.
Of course we'd end up back here.
[Jeff] You know, you are just like my son.
[Miles] I am? I-- [laughs] That's so silly. Imagine that.
-[Spot] Back where it all started! -[Miles] Look out!
[Spot] The crucible of our connection!
[Miles] Don't try to wow me with big words.
I do the crossword every day.
-[Spot] Is it all coming back to you? -[Miles] What are you talking about?
[Spot] The creation event.
[Miles] What?
-Yeah. -Hey, we got cut off.
This is our son we're talking about. Nothing is more important than family.
[Jeff yells, then grunts] I'm kind of in the middle of something.
[Spot grunts] Destiny brought us here.
-You see now, don't you? -I really don't.
[Spot] I am your nemesis.
Dude, you are not.
You missed. You can't contain the Spot. Ow!
You really don't remember what you did to me?
-What I did for you? -[Miles] Uh... No.
[Spot] I worked at Alchemax.
I ran a test on this collider
that brought a spider here from another dimension.
-Forty-two. -[man] Its home dimension.
[Spot] It escaped. And it bit you.
My spider made you Spider-Man.
-What? -You ran through the cafeteria.
-He took a bagel! -You hit me with a bagel.
I've hit a lot of different villains with a lot of different food.
[Spot] You make your flippy, little sassy jokes, and everyone loves them.
But no one knows what it feels like to be on the other side of them.
But no one knows what it feels like to be on the other side of them. [in deep voice] I'm just trying to lighten the mood.
[in deep voice] I'm just trying to lighten the mood.
I created you.
You created me.
Spider-Man, why did you create that guy?
I didn't. He's talking crazy.
I was in this collider room when you blew it up!
[Spot] Because of you...
I lost my job, my life,
my face!
My family won't even look at me.
I made you into a hero.
You made me into this!
Look at me! You did this to me!
Look at me! I'll make you respect me!
I am your neme--
Well, where'd he go?
He kicked his own butt.
[Jeff] You know we're supposed to catch the bad guys, right?
[Miles] I always do.
-Usually. -[siren wailing]
-Gutierrez! Get the crane, man. -[Gutierrez] Yes, sir!
-Gutierrez! Get the crane, man. -[Gutierrez] Yes, sir! [Jeff groans] This here is why nobody likes us, man.
-[Miles] "Us"? -I am trying to do right out here.
-I'm trying too. -You need to be a better role model.
-I'm trying too. -You need to be a better role model. I'm a great role model.
Hey, Gutierrez, you can cancel the crane.
I swear, I'll quit my job!
-Do you wanna talk about it? -Are you crazy?!
Well, men of your generation ignore their mental health too long.
[Jeff] Oh, boy.
What am I even doing?
'Cause no matter what I do, someone always thinks I'm blowing it.
[Miles] I know the feeling.
So your son.
How's he doing? You think he's gonna figure it all out?
-Honestly? -Yeah.
-He's a good kid. -Yeah?
It's scary. He says these things that are so smart.
Cool. Well, I should probably--
And then he does these things that are so stupid.
I just don't want him to mess it up.
Maybe get off the kid's ass.
-I'm sorry, what? -What? What? I don't know.
And I hate that he's not being honest with me.
Maybe he's scared to talk to you.
Why would anyone be scared to talk to me?
I don't-- I don't know.
It's just-- You think you're getting pretty good at being a parent. You think you got it licked.
You think you got it licked.
And then they go and grow up.
I just don't wanna lose him, you know?
Well, as an objective observer with no skin in the game,
I say you gotta let him spread his wings, man.
-Like this. -Yeah.
I don't know.
If this isn't nice, what is?
I should go.
Yeah, and catch that holes guy.
Don't worry. I don't think that guy's gonna show his face again.
[Spot] What?
Okay.
I think I kicked myself...
into myself.
Well, this is new.
Hello? Hello? Echo, echo. No echo.
Hypothesis:
I'm going to put my head in that hole.
-Hello. -[screams]
Ow! Please! Ow, ow, ow!
Stop it, stop it, stop it! [groans]
That was cool.
My holes can take me anywhere.
-Whoop. -[people screaming]
Excuse me. Hi.
-Sorry to bug you. I know you're busy. -What do you want?
I know it's weird. I came out of nowhere.
But I think I'm becoming a transdimensional superbeing.
-So? -"So?"
I'm literally splitting the fabric of space and time.
For you, it's just a Tuesday night.
You're acting like weird stuff like this happens to you all the time.
Can I have some gum?
Wow.
The power of the multiverse in the palm of my hand.
My holes aren't a curse! They're the answer!
Can you stop talking about your holes?
You're making everyone uncomfortable.
No, no, no. You're gonna love this. Look, look, look. [grunting]
[groans] I'm out of spots, wouldn't you know it. Uh...
As you were, gentlemen.
I'm coming for you, Spider-Man!
[man 1] Take this one step at a time.
[man 2] Does anybody have the instructions for this building?
-[ominous music playing] -Oh, no.
Tomorrow morning, Spider-Man, page one, with a decent picture.
-You're right, boss. -Shut up.
-Uh-huh. -Get out of here! You got it, boss. I'm on it.
I need a raise.
[imitates beep] Miguel, it's Peter. We got an anomaly.
Thank you, Peter. You're one of our best.
-Jess, who's on this? -[imitates beep]
-Have you seen Miles? -No.
Nope.
-Have you seen Miles? -[woman speaking in Spanish]
-What are you doing? -[in English] Speech!
-Okay, everybody. -No. I'm terrible at speeches.
Oh, dear God, no.
Rio, come on.
Um... Hi.
[Miles] And I want you to know, no matter what,
even though we've had our ups and downs,
-I'm so proud of you today, and every day. -[woman] Hey.
-Parentheses. Mostly. LOL. -Hey.
-Parentheses. Mostly. LOL. -Hey. Hey, Mr. Spider-Man, it won't fit on one cake.
Hey, Mr. Spider-Man, it won't fit on one cake.
Can't you write smaller?
Can't you write shorter?
Come again!
What else can I say about Jeff?
That he was almost 10 pounds as a baby. I know you're gonna be embarrassed.
He almost killed his mother. Look at those shoulders.
-Oh, no. Okay. That's it. -[Rio] A big baby.
-Okay, okay. -Oh, my God.
He's so funny.
I'll take the mic. No more mics for you, okay?
-Thank you, Rio, for that. -[groans] Where is that kid?
[Jeff] I didn't always know what I wanted to do in life.
I was pulled in a lot of different directions when I was young.
Me and my brother came up in this neighborhood.
Just a couple of knuckleheads running the streets.
It is I, the Armadillo-- [grunts] Oh!
[chuckles] You guys used to chase us out of your stores.
And now, if you can believe it, it's my job to look out for you.
-And then I had a kid. -Stop, thief!
[Jeff] And everything changed for the better.
[Miles] Oh, no.
I don't even know about giving a toast 'cause I should be toasting you all.
No, no, no!
So to my brother, who we miss every single day.
He's definitely up there laughing at me right now.
They're making me captain, bro. [chuckles]
To my wife, mi amor.
I can't even start because I'll never stop.
Have to take the mic from me.
And to my son...
The reason that I do any of this in the first place.
I love you, Miles.
And I will always, always be here for you.
Benny, man. Come on, drop the beat!
[growls] I'm gonna kill that kid.
[man] Hey! Congrats, Jeff! -Hey! Hey, hey. -Thank you for coming.
-Hey! Hey, hey. -Thank you for coming.
-Hey, Miles. Where have you been? -What's up, man?
-You keeping your head up at that school? -[Miles] Oh, yeah, you bet.
Hola, Miles! Hi.
Hola, Miles! Hi. -Your parents have been looking for you. -I don't know why.
-Your parents have been looking for you. -I don't know why. -I've just been here the whole time. -Oye.
-Ah! Hi. -You were supposed to be here at 5.
-Ah! Hi. -You were supposed to be here at 5. -I know. -You disrespected your dad.
-[Jeff] Yup. Mm-hm. -Missed his beautiful toast.
Come on. Did you even see the cakes? There's some heartfelt messages on them.
That's not what I meant.
Your dad studied for eight months.
Nine. It was like giving birth.
-No, it wasn't. -Of course not.
You made us sit in that office and talk to that lady without you.
-There was an emergency. -What, a graffiti emergency?
A partying-with-some-friends- I've-never-met emergency?
Explain yourself.
Sounds like you're explaining it pretty well. -That's funny. Jeff, we got a funny son. -I'm not laughing.
-That's funny. Jeff, we got a funny son. -I'm not laughing.
-I don't feel grown-up. -[in English] Wow, this is a cool shirt.
Okay! Okay, okay. Have you checked out the spread?
-Oye! -Ah! Who you running around with? -Just-- -Is it Ganke? I never liked him.
-Just-- -Is it Ganke? I never liked him. Yes, you did.
-He calls me by my first name. -Ugh. We hate that.
-I have more friends than just Ganke. -Like who?
Well, there's-- There's Peter.
You know, uh, but he left town.
Um, there's-- There's Gwanda.
You know, she also left town.
-Miles, dame un break. -Is that Spanglish?
Has it ever occurred to you that maybe I'm just doing benign, private,
Has it ever occurred to you that maybe I'm just doing benign, private, unremarkable things when I'm not with you guys?
-Nope. -Never. I am 15 years old. I am basically an adult.
-Oh, right. -You don't have a driver's license. -Neither does Mom! -We live in New York
-Neither does Mom! -We live in New York and never plan to leave.
-It's my life. -It's not your life.
It's mine and your father's and your abuelos' y abuelas',
who put you in this spot that I'd give anything to be in.
All right. Whatever, whatever.
"Whatever"? -Wow. -"Whatever"?
-Wow. -"Whatever"?
-Do I get to say it? Please tell me I can. -Say it.
-Do I get to say it? Please tell me I can. -Say it. -You're grounded! -What?
-You're grounded! -What?
-Oh, yeah! -For how long? -A month! -Dad. Mom, are you--? Seriously?
-A month! -Dad. Mom, are you--? Seriously? Yeah, dead serious.
-You don't understand. -You are right.
I have no idea what's going on with you! So why don't you tell me?
-[music volume increases] -Just listen to me!
Okay, champ, you got it. Go for it. Say whatever you wanna say.
What do you got to tell me so bad?
[sighs] You know what? Never mind.
All right, great, walk away.
Because now you got two months!
That was good, right?
Two months.
I'm Spider-Man. I'm not grounded.
[Gwen] Miles!
Miles!
You got a minute?
-[chuckles] -How did you get--?
How did you get--? How have you been?
Uh, I've been good.
I've been-- Yeah, just great. Look at you.
You, uh-- You grew, huh? -Had a little growth spurt? -Uh, yeah. Your hair has gotten pinker.
-Had a little growth spurt? -Uh, yeah. Your hair has gotten pinker.
-Is this the room you grew up in? -It is. Um...
-[lilting, pensive music playing] -But my dorm room is very adult.
Cool. Yeah, no, I used to play with these when I was younger too.
-Uh, that's a collectible. -I used to have this one.
-An extremely rare, highly sought-- -Why is it still in the package? Eee! Um... [laughs]
That's fine.
-Are these your drawings? They're good. -Hey. What? No.
[Gwen] Wow, there's so many.
Missed you too.
So, what are you doing here?
I mean, I thought I'd never see you again.
Wanna get out of here?
I'm grounded.
Bummer.
Is Spider-Man grounded?
I mean, I...
[Rio] Miles?
Your dad's ready to listen now.
That's three months!
[Miles] Wait, hold on.
There's an elite society with all the best Spider-People in it?
-Okay, so there's this lady, Jess Drew. -Uh-huh?
-She rides a motorcycle. -Motorcycle? Oh, my gosh, I'm learning so much from her.
Oh, yeah. I've learned a lot of stuff too.
I've leveled up my whole thing. See?
-[Gwen] Oh, yeah? -Yeah.
-[Gwen] Let's see it, then. -Let's go.
[Gwen] Thread the needle.
Easy.
[Gwen] And Miguel. -The whole thing was his idea. -[Miles] Right.
And who's Miguel?
[Gwen] Oh, he's like a ninja-vampire-Spider-Man but a good guy.
[Miles] A vampire good guy. I'd pay good money to see that.
-So how long ago did they invite you? -Only like a few months ago.
-"Months" is kind of a long time. -[Gwen] Okay, this one counts for two.
Look at you.
Look at me.
[Miles] Keep the change.
-So this club. -Look at that dum-dum.
[Miles] What kind of stuff do you do? [Gwen] Guy in the stripes, ten points.
We're trying to keep the multiverse from collapsing.
[Miles] I thought we did that already.
[Gwen] Like, last week we had this mission to some Shakespeare dimension.
-[Miles] What? -And Hobie and I just, like-- -[Miles] Who's Hobie? -[Gwen] Oh, my gosh, you would love him.
-[Miles] Who's Hobie? -[Gwen] Oh, my gosh, you would love him.
He lets me crash in his dimension sometimes.
[Miles] What does that mean, you stay overnight or...?
[Gwen] Anyway, they're pretty strict about where I go,
or I really would have come to see you sooner.
Right. So, uh-- So why'd you come now?
Don't do that. [yelps]
Hey, Gw-- Uh, Gwen?
Where'd you go?
Where did she go?
-[Gwen] Ah! -Oh, hey. There you are. -What were you doing? -Waiting for you.
-What were you doing? -Waiting for you.
[Miles] No, it's not the Greek burger place.
-This is a cool thinking spot. -[Miles] Right?
Who needs a treadmill when you have the Williamsburgh Bank Building?
-["Another Dimension" playing] -So, uh, you and your dad.
You still haven't talked?
What exactly would we talk about?
"Hey, Dad, how have the last few months been?
You still think I murdered my best friend?"
I don't know.
I mean, my parents-- I mean, maybe if I told them--
Don't.
Trust me on that.
Well...
Maybe some things are supposed to be just for us.
That's a nice way to think about it.
I'm just a really emotionally intelligent guy.
Beyond my years.
It really is always so great to talk to you.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
I mean, how many people can you talk to about this stuff?
You don't even know.
What?
You're the only friend I've ever really made after Peter died.
Other than Hobie, right?
-That's different. -Yeah? How's that?
I don't know.
You and me, it's...
We're the same.
In the important ways, you know?
In every other universe, Gwen Stacy falls for Spider-Man.
And in every other universe,
it doesn't end well.
Well, there's a first time for everything, right?
-Mmm! Oh, wow. Feelings make me hungry. -Oh, yeah,
-Mmm! Oh, wow. Feelings make me hungry. -Oh, yeah, these plátanos are just deep-fried feelings.
She looks old enough to vote.
I bet she doesn't even speak Spanish. Well, qué barbaridad.
[Miles] This keeps you from glitching in other dimensions?
[Gwen] Yeah. Pretty cool.
[Miles] What's it gonna take for Miguel O'Hara to notice Miles Morales?
[chuckles] I'll put in a good word.
I'm just saying, if I had a watch, I could come with you.
-Miles, look-- -I did save the multiverse.
It's a really small, elite strike force.
I can turn invisible. I have, like, electric powers.
-There aren't a lot of slots. -Think about it.
Ah, right.
Look, if it was up to me, you--
I know. I know, I know.
Oh, no. No, no.
-Don't do that. Miles! -All right.
-It's, uh, really delicate. -Geez.
Sorry. I didn't mean to, um, snap.
Okay. All right. I'm sorry.
-Hello! Hi. -[Gwen and Miles yelp]
-Oh, boy. -I'm Miles's mom.
Rio! Hi! I've heard so much about you.
You're using my first name. Okay.
This is nice. We found it in Miles's room, so...
-I guess you must've been there, huh? -And you must be Jeff.
She called me Jeff. That's very sweet. "Jeff."
You must mean Lieutenant Morales.
Soon to be Captain Morales.
Ah! Captain.
Gwanda and I are friends from school.
-Yeah, we were just catching up. -Oh...
Don't take him from me.
Mom.
[laughing] I'm just kidding. He's grounded, so you can't.
-Don't break his heart. -Mom!
-Alpha Squad, Zero Red Spider Alert. -Shoot, I have to go.
-Really? -Yeah, I forgot to get my steps in.
[laughs nervously] Really, really wish I could stay longer.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye.
Yeah, bye.
I can hear you being quiet, Mom.
I hope I didn't ice your game, man.
No one my age says those words in that order, Mom.
It's just hard to see my little man not be my little boy all the time.
Yeah.
Papá, you know you can tell me anything.
Well...
I'm...
I'm sorry I was late.
[in English] Go.
She seems like a nice girl.
-Is this a trick? -It's not a trick.
-Is this a trick? -It's not a trick. Geez.
What are you--?
Let me fix you. Just...
For years I've been taking care of this little boy, right?
Making sure he's loved,
that he feels like he belongs wherever he wants to be.
He wants to go out into the world and do great big things.
And what I worry about most...
is they won't look out for you like us.
They won't root for you like us.
So here's the deal.
Wherever you go from here, you have to promise to take care of that little boy for me.
Make sure he never forgets where he came from.
And he never doubts that he's loved.
And he never lets anyone at those big, fancy places he's gonna be in
tell him that he doesn't belong there.
And when he comes home, and he better come home...
you're gonna be early,
and you're gonna be holding a normal, nice cake.
Yeah, okay.
You gotta promise, Miles.
I promise.
Just...
-don't get lost. -Mm-hm. Okay.
All right.
[in English] Cool.
[in English] Now go. Get out of here.
And when you come back, you're still grounded.
Yeah, I'm smiling like it's a joke, but it's true.
Yeah, I figured.
See you later.
With a cake.
Shoot.
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, the car!
[Gwen] Shoot.
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot.
-Show me what happened. -[LYLA] Replay commencing.
[Spot] Spots. That's the thing. I need more spots!
Ha! Oh, my gosh. It was right under where my nose would've been.
I just need a little bit more dimensional juice or whatever.
-Shoot. -Shoot!
Never came up with a good name. Branding was never my strong suit.
The city power line to my micro collider prototype
could generate a little more concentrated dark energy.
Shoot.
This is what I love about science!
[Gwen] Shoot!
I just need enough to get me somewhere with a full-size collider.
And, Spider-Man, I'll make you pay for everything you took away from me.
All right, this is gonna work.
Or vaporize me and everything in this building,
which would not be good.
-Shoot. -Shoot.
Oh, man.
-Shoot. -Shoot.
[LYLA] Replay complete.
Why, why, why? [groans]
-Gwen, Gwen, Gwen! -Gwen. Hi.
Whatcha doing?
Nothing. Uh, good. All good. Yeah, everything's good. Bye.
Where's the bad guy you were supposed to monitor?
He just stepped out for a moment.
-Dude! -He's just some villain of the week.
-LYLA! -Oh! We don't need--
Tracking...
Hey, look, I got him. Nope, never mind.
Hold on. Slippery guy.
-Did you go see your little friend? -What? No.
-[Jess] Miles? -I mean...
Are you kidding me?
-Only briefly. From afar. -How far?
Like, you know, about this:
-About this far. -That's way too close.
Girl!
Look, I had to know how he was.
-I honestly can't with you. -I know I messed up, okay?
[Jess] He can't be part of this.
[Gwen] I know.
-I'll never see him again. All right? -[Jess] No kidding.
-Hey, guys? He's making his own portals. -What?
He can jump wherever he wants. He could be a total canon killer.
You said he was the villain of the week. Do you know how bad this is for you?
Every dimension he stops at has an Alchemax.
-What's he up to, Gwen? -I don't know.
[Miles] He's making himself more powerful so he can beat me.
Amazing. My star pupil, everyone.
I'll get him, okay? I can get backup.
If Miguel finds out I let you come--
Don't tell Miguel. He'll kick me out and--
What if he sends me home?
I got him. Earth-50101.
What do you wanna do?
You never made a mistake?
Never got too close to someone?
I did.
But I got over it.
Alert the local Spider. Tell him Gwen will meet him there.
Alert the local Spider. Tell him Gwen will meet him there. [LYLA] I'm on it.
-Thank you. I won't let you down again. -Okay. You're welcome. Shut up.
You got an hour to fix this.
Or I can't help you.
Goodbye, Miles.
-[cheering and chattering] -Sorry. Congratulations!
[Spot] See that? This is incredible. -Like a new person. -[Gwen] Where'd you go?
[Spot] In the mirror, I wouldn't recognize myself.
-[Gwen] Stay still. -I'd envy that person I was looking at.
-[Gwen] I have eyes on the anomaly. -[Jess] Get hands on him.
Stop hovering. You're hovering.
Hello, pardon me, locals.
Wow, four on there. That's very dangerous.
That looks good.
-Which way to Alchemax? Oh! [coughs] -[screaming]
It's a place with a big collider--
-Hey, cow guy! "Moo-ve" over! -[Spot] That's the best you could do?
-[Miles] Gwen! I'm here to help! -Miles, are you--?
[Spot] Whoopsie-daisy. You weren't expecting that, were you?
-[Miles] Oh, no! -[Spot] Neither was I. I'm in the zone!
-[Miles] I got you! -Did you follow me?
No, I just saw where you went and went there without you knowing.
-You're not supposed to be here! -What are you talking about? I'm helping--
No! No, no, no!
I shouldn't have ever come to see you.
Dang.
[Pav] Hey, who's the new guy?
Hey, Pav. He's Miles and he wasn't invited.
[Pav] Oh! You weren't invited and you came anyway?
-Right? -New guy must be in love with you.
-[Gwen] Okay, whoa. -[Miles] No.
-I'm not. -I'm good at reading people.
-[Gwen] He's not. -[Miles] Who are you?
-[Pav] Glad you asked, new guy. -I'm not a new guy.
My name is Pavitr Prabhakar, and for the past six months--
Six? And even he got a watch?
-Yeah, uh... -Being Spider-Man is so easy.
I wake up, skip the workout,
because I'm naturally buff and I don't wanna get too big.
because I'm naturally buff and I don't wanna get too big. Do almost nothing with my amazing hair.
You don't use any product at all?
Just coconut oil, prayer, some genetics.
Then I swing by school. Don't really have to try, but I do anyway.
Fight a few bad guys, feed a few street dogs,
quick break for a cup of chai with my Maya Auntie--
-I love chai tea. -What did you just say?
"Chai tea"? "Chai" means "tea," bro. You're saying "tea" tea.
"Chai" means "tea," bro. You're saying "tea" tea.
Would I ask you for a "coffee" coffee with "cream" cream?
I'm so sorry.
[Pav] Then I hang out with my girlfriend, Gayatri.
She's an extremely classy teenager.
Hey, girl. Tonight, I was thinking--
Hello, Police Inspector Singh. This is your daughter. I do not know her.
To top it off, I live in the best possible Spider-Man city, Mumbattan.
Quick tour. This is where the traffic is, this is where the traffic is.
Quick tour. This is where the traffic is, this is where the traffic is. Traffic here too. This is where the British stole all of our stuff. Whoa!
Traffic here too. This is where the British stole all of our stuff. Whoa!
-[Spot] Hello, Spider-Man. -[Gwen] Hi.
-[Pav] Hey. -[Spot] Not you.
-[Pav] Hey. -[Spot] Not you. [Gwen] You talking to him or me?
-[Miles] Think he means me. -[Spot] Yeah. Him.
[Miles] I got this, guys.
-Huh? -Wow. How are you?
-[dramatic music playing] -Can you tell I leveled up my game?
I'm on a journey of self-improvement.
[Pav] And you came to India.
That's a Western culture cliché. Don't Eat, Pray, Love me, bro.
I did not mean it like that.
Let me guess, you're gonna ask me about saffron and cardamom
and naan bread, which is the same as saying "bread" bread,
which is the same as saying "chai tea."
-[Spot] Oh, I love chai tea. -[Pav] No!
[Miles] Come on, man! I think maybe we got off on the wrong foot.
[Miles] Come on, man! I think maybe we got off on the wrong foot. Let's just talk about this.
Fine. You made me feel empty, like I had a hole inside of me.
[Spot] We all have holes.
But now I found out what to fill that hole up with.
More holes!
[Miles] That doesn't make any sense!
[Spot] It will.
I'm okay. I'm good.
-Don't worry. -[Gwen] We won't.
This romantic tension is so palpable.
If Spot gets more holes...
-[Pav] Will they, won't they? -...he'll be unstoppable!
-We can't let him get to-- -[Gwen] Alchemax?
[Pav] See? How can you guys even concentrate?
Hey, does he know about Hobie?
-What should I know about Hobie? -Oh, looks like he did not know.
Boop.
Go away. Go away. See you later. Thanks for coming.
[Pav] Would you please deactivate this strong barrier?
[man] It can't be turned off until the collider sequence is complete.
[man] It can't be turned off until the collider sequence is complete. The collider sequence? Oh, man.
The collider sequence? Oh, man.
-[Gwen] You need to stop! -[Miles] You don't know what you're doing!
-[Gwen] You need to stop! -[Miles] You don't know what you're doing! [Spot] I'm about to be so much more than a villain of the week.
I'm sorry I called you that, okay? You're a great villain.
[Spot] Oh, not yet, I'm not. -[automated voice] Initializing collider. -No!
-[automated voice] Initializing collider. -No!
-[beeping] -[whirring]
How's it going now?
Great. Anyone got any ideas?
[Pav] Oh, I have so many, but none for this.
Stand back. I've been working on something new.
-[Pav] How long does this usually take? -[Miles] Just give me a second.
Do you want us to do something, or do we just stand here?
Are you charging it, or--?
No. I'm absorbing it so I can shoot it back.
-[Gwen] Looks like charging. -[Pav] Does this have a name?
[Miles] Hold your questions until I'm done breaking this!
Just let me do this!
[Hobie] Oi, oi!
-Hobie! -[Pav] Hobie, my guy!
-[Miles] Hobie? -[Spot] Look, another one.
-[Miles] Hobie? -[Spot] Look, another one. I love how many different variations of you guys there are.
-Man-like, Pav! Big stepper! Yeah, mate! -What's this dude saying?
[Pav] It's English for "We get along great, and we're close friends."
Is this the younger from 1610?
Do you understand this guy?
[Pav] Hobie, thanks for breaking the shield!
[Miles] I loosened it.
Bit of advice. Use the palm, not just your fingers.
What's up with your suit? Is he bleeding from his armpits?
-[Gwen] Miles, Hobie. Hobie, Miles. -Hi. I've never heard of you
-[Gwen] Miles, Hobie. Hobie, Miles. -Hi. I've never heard of you because Gwen barely ever mentions you.
A'ight, my name's Hobie, Hobie Brown. I was bitten by a--
Wouldn't you like to know? You know what I mean?
For the last three years, I've been the one and only-- Wait, wait, wait.
Think I'm gonna show you my secret identity? Come out of it.
That is, when I'm not playing shows, antagonizing fascists,
staging unpermitted political actions slash performance-art pieces,
or having a laugh at the pub with the mandem.
I'm not a role model. I was briefly a runway model.
I hate the a.m. I hate the PM. I hate labels.
I'm not a hero because calling yourself a hero
makes you a self-mythologizing, narcissistic autocrat.
Come on! I thought you hated labels.
[Hobie] Gwendy, you left your jumper around my place.
-What's a jumper? -[Pav] It's a sweater.
-How many sweaters do you have? -That's not mine, I'm sure.
-[Hobie] And your toothbrush. -[Miles] Wait, what?
-[Pav yells] -[Hobie] Are those my Chucks?
-[Spot] You make a heck of a team. -[Hobie] I don't believe in teams.
-[Spot] You make a heck of a team. -[Hobie] I don't believe in teams. -[Miles] Aren't you in a band? -I don't believe in consistency.
-[Miles] Aren't you in a band? -I don't believe in consistency.
This guy's killing me.
This is gonna be good for us, Spider-Man.
You and me, we're finally gonna live up to our potential.
You'll finally have a villain worth fighting.
And I won't be just a joke to you!
[Miles] You're not a joke!
-Right, gang? -[Gwen] Absolutely.
-[Pav] Completely unamusing! -[Hobie] I don't believe in comedy!
Just kidding!
[Miles] See? No one here thinks you're a joke!
-[Spot] They won't after this. -[Miles] No!
Wow. That was another easy adventure for Spider-Man. -[Gwen] No, no, no! -[Miles] No, no, no!
I'm coming!
[Miles] What was that?
[Spot] Our future.
I'm gonna take everything from you, like you took everything from me.
What?
[Spot] See you back home, Spider-Man.
Miles. Miles!
You okay? We gotta go.
[Hobie] Oi, oi, liven up, mate. No time to get dizzy.
[Pav] Everyone, chalo, chalo!
We'll clear the path. You slow down that building.
[Hobie] I'll do it. But not because you told me to.
[man] Everybody, run!
Watch out!
Gayatri!
Gayatri! No!
[LYLA] Gwen, heads up.
Markers are predicting an incoming canon event.
So tread carefully.
I'm on it.
Somebody, help!
-Hurry, everyone! This way, quickly! -[girl] Help!
Inspector Singh!
I can do both!
-[Miles] I got him, I got him! -[Gwen] Miles!
Don't worry. Thread the needle, ring the bell, right?
-It's too dangerous. -I'll be okay, I promise.
Miles!
[Gwen] Miles!
No! No.
You're all right.
I promised.
[Pav] Are you okay? I was so worried.
I mean, you seem like a nice young woman that I do not know.
Gayatri!
Not bad, right?
Right.
[in English] I've never seen him so emotional.
[in English] Excellent job.
Man-like, Miles! My guy!
[Pav] Easy.
So, what do you think?
What I always think.
You're amazing.
We make a good team. Yeah?
Yeah.
[Pav] Guys, what's that?
[Hobie] It's a metaphor for capitalism.
[Gwen] It's a lot worse than that.
Okay, guys, secure the area, clear all civilians, and let's contain this quantum hole.
Hey, I'm Miles. We met before, when I was invisible.
Hey, I'm Miles. We met before, when I was invisible. I know who you are.
Is everything going to be okay?
Okay, let me explain.
Miguel wants you back at HQ.
-Miles was just about to head out. -All of you.
-I don't follow orders, neither does he. -I'm invited to HQ? Whoo!
How are you even cooler under your mask?
I was this cool the whole time.
Hey, over here.
Yo, this place is wild.
-[Jess] Any sign of Spot? -[Malala] Let me ask.
-[Jess] Any sign of Spot? -[Malala] Let me ask. Anybody spot Spot?
-Oh, so funny. Anybody else got jokes? -Now that you mention it.
-Oh, so funny. Anybody else got jokes? -Now that you mention it. [Gwen] Well, you know what they say, we need to run a spot check.
-[Spider-Beings chattering] -[Miles] This is unbelievable.
-This is the lobby. -Oh.
Welcome to Spider-Society.
It's a bit much, innit?
[Miles] What happened to that small, elite strike team?
A lot of these are part-time.
Gwendy, how much have you told him, hm? About his place in all this?
A little.
-Maybe not enough. -Here.
My own watch!
It's a day pass. This just keeps you from...
...doing that.
-[Peter] Hey, Gwen. -Hey, Peter.
Hey, I'm Miles.
-[Peters] Hey, Gwen. -Hey, Peters.
I'm a new recruit.
Peter, take a team to the transport deck to help deal with this Spot mess.
Peter, take a team to the transport deck to help deal with this Spot mess. -[honks horn] -I wouldn't call it a mess.
-[honks horn] -I wouldn't call it a mess. -More like a success in progress. -Ben, I need--
-More like a success in progress. -Ben, I need--
Sorry, I can't talk right now. I'm thinking about my past.
Actually, we need you here for some reason.
[yells] That was a particularly harrowing memory.
-Is he okay? -[neighs]
-Ah! -Howdy. Name's Web-Slinger.
-Why does the horse need a mask? -[Web-Slinger] To conceal her face.
Giddy up!
-[yelling] -[Miles] Who is in these laser cages?
Anomalies. Folks who wound up in the wrong dimension.
[Jess] We kick their butts and send them home.
They're not very interesting.
-We got a bunch of Doc Ocks. -That's interesting.
A Moosterio. Ms. Sterio.
A Moosterio. Ms. Sterio. -Video game guy. -[Miles] I love video games!
-Another video game guy. -Are you talking to me?
Typeface.
-Go to Helvetica, Spider-Man! -Bold.
An interesting Kraven, a boring Rhino.
A Prowler.
-Prowler? -[Gwen] Not your Prowler.
Hey.
Hey.
-It's rude to stare. -Caught that one myself.
-I slipped. -You? I did all the work.
How many missions have you been on together?
-Not that many. -Couple dozen.
That's cool. Sorry.
-I'm Spider-Man. -Oh, no way! All of us are.
-Can we just keep moving? -Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you?
I'm an avatar.
My body is back in my parents' dimension, chilling in a gaming chair and eating Fritos.
chilling in a gaming chair and eating Fritos. [woman] Right, because you don't listen.
Here is better.
I hear that.
What does that do?
Apart from having a great name?
-The Go Home Machine. -What'd I say, eh?
I voted against it.
[Margo] It detects whatever dimension your DNA is from
and sends you there.
It's super humane and not creepy.
[Margo] See you, dawg. Don't come back.
We should go. We don't wanna keep the boss waiting.
-See you around? -Let's go!
-Good luck out there, man. -Okay, bye!
[LYLA] Miguel sounds hangry.
[Jess] He likes those empanadas from the cafeteria.
Don't ask me why.
My name is Miguel O'Hara.
I'm this dimension's one and only Spider-Man.
At least, I was.
But I'm not like the others.
I don't always like what I have to do.
But I know I have to be the one to do it.
I've given up too much to stop now.
Whoa, yo.
Bet this doesn't even do anything.
[Miles] Maybe it did before you ripped it out of a wall.
It's propaganda, bruv. To distract you from the truth.
[sighs] And what's that?
I ain't got a Scooby Doo. That's what they want.
-Why you wanna be part of this lot? -[Miles] To get a watch.
-Make your own watch. -Pssh.
Bet you got a nice setup, eh? Nice parents.
They're fine. I mean, we got in a fight, but...
They just want what's best for me, so...
-That's a bloody shame. -Why?
'Cause you're not ready for everybody else.
-[girl] We did it this time! -[man] Okay, okay, mija.
Good job.
[Hobie] Listen to me, bruv. Whole point of being Spider-Man is your independence.
Being your own boss. You don't need all this.
-Then why are you here? -Looking out for my drummer, is all.
I want to be in a band. I--
I wanna see my friends, and I need a watch to do that.
Guys, come on.
All right. Squashed.
Don't enlist till you know what war you're fighting.
[whispers] Yeah, I know it's slow.
But it's his thing.
[in normal voice] Miguel O'Hara, meet Miles Morales. Hey! [speaks in Spanish]
[in English] I speak Spanish.
-[in English] I'm excited to get going. -[in English] Oh. Great.
-I have new ideas on how to catch Spot. -Oh. Wow. Uh-huh.
[Miles] He just wants to be taken seriously, like we all do. Whoa!
He's worried about Spot. I'll worry about Spot!
-What did I do? -Miguel! It's not his fault.
-Fault? Hold up. -You blew another hole in the multiverse!
-He doesn't know any better. -I do know what-- Not know what?
But you did, Gwen.
And you-- I'm just gonna try to ignore you.
-I just can't. I can't even. -I ain't even here.
Or here.
-What's happening? -[Peter] Hey, Miguel!
-What's happening? -[Peter] Hey, Miguel! Come on, go easy on the kid.
-He had a terrible teacher. -[uplifting music playing]
He had no chance.
-Peter! -Oh, boy.
Humbling-Reality Spider-Man has arrived.
-Miles! -Dude!
Don't be afraid of my friend Miguel. He just looks scary. He's got no bite.
-[groans] Peter. -You're growing up on me. You look great.
-You look solid, you know. You look good. -Define "solid."
What happened? You bleeding from the armpits?
-Peter, you-- -Don't worry, we'll get you a new suit.
Peter, you gotta tell them--
-Wait. What is that? -[Peter] Mayday!
-You have a baby! -I have a baby.
This is crazy.
Don't forget to keep your little day pass on, honey.
Oh, you have one too. I didn't know they made those for adults.
-Give me a second. Mayday! -The kid's an anarchist.
I'm coming up to get you. Here I come. Don't move.
I got you. I knew I was gonna regret making her that web shooter.
I shouldn't have done it. That's an actual mistake.
-You wanna see pictures? -She's right there.
-Look at this pic! -Oh, you've got them.
-She's incredible. -Yup.
This is her funny face. That's her mad face.
This one is the studious one.
Watch out, the next one you're gonna crack up.
Miguel's gonna die. Miguel, look at this one.
I'm trying to hold a serious adult conversation.
You're the only Spider-Man who isn't funny. -We're supposed to be funny. -The fate of the multiverse--
-We're supposed to be funny. -The fate of the multiverse--
You always lose me with that.
You say, "The fate of the multiverse," and my brain dies.
Do you guys smell that? Mayday took a crap.
-Yup. She's a Parker. -[Miguel] Miles. That happens when a Parker eats an avocado.
-You disrupted a canon event. -Canon event?
-You disrupted a canon event. -Canon event? The kid wasn't thinking. That's not how he works.
The kid wasn't thinking. That's not how he works.
That's insulting.
Taking a crap on the establishment. I salute you.
Wait, what are you upset about? I saved those people.
And that's the problem.
-LYLA, do the thing. -Huh? What thing?
What do you mean, "What thing?" The information-explainy thing.
Okay.
What's this?
This is everything.
Can you be more specific?
Can you not talk for a second?
[Miles] Yeah, yeah, I-- [Miguel] And this here?
This is all of us.
All of our lives woven together
in a beautiful web of life and destiny.
The Spider-Verse.
Spider-Verse.
That's stupid.
It's called the Arachnohumanoid Polymultiverse.
Which sounds stupid too, I guess.
And these nodes where the lines converge?
[Miguel] They are the canon.
Chapters that are a part of every Spider's story every time.
Some good.
Some bad.
Some very bad.
Just keep going.
Uncle Aaron.
This one, Event ASM-90.
A police captain close to Spider-Man dies,
saving a kid from falling rubble during a battle with an archnemesis.
Captain Stacy.
I'm so sorry.
No.
That happened to you?
And me.
Ey. What of it?
[Miguel] That's how the story is supposed to go.
Canon events are the connections that bind our lives together.
But those connections can be broken.
That's why anomalies are so dangerous.
Inspector Singh's death was a canon event.
You weren't supposed to be there. And you weren't supposed to save him.
-That's why Gwen tried to stop you. -[Gwen] Miles!
I thought you were trying to save me.
I was. I...
I was doing both.
And now, Miles, because you changed the story,
Pavitr's dimension is unraveling.
If we're lucky, we can stop it.
We haven't always been lucky.
That wasn't me. That was the Spot.
It's what happens when you break the canon.
[Miles] How do you know?
Because I broke it once myself.
I found a world where I had a family. Where I was happy.
At least, a version of me was.
And that version of myself was killed.
So I replaced him.
I thought it was harmless.
But I was wrong.
Daddy? Dad.
Daddy, no!
[Miguel] Isn't that right, Peter?
Yeah.
You break enough canon, save enough captains...
and we could lose everything.
My dad is about to be captain.
No.
[Spot] I'm gonna take everything from you...
-like you took everything from me. -[Jeff] I'm coming!
Spot does it.
He kills him.
When does it happen?
-When does it happen? -In two days.
When he's sworn in.
That's what the model says.
[Miguel] I'm sorry, Miles.
Send me home.
I can't do that. Not now.
What am I supposed to do? Just let him die?
What about your dad?
He's a captain, right?
Yeah.
[Miles] And that's it?
You aren't gonna do anything about it?
Okay, what about Uncle Ben?
That have been okay if you knew and you just let it play out?
If not for Uncle Ben,
most of us wouldn't be here, Miles.
And all the good we did, it...
It wouldn't have been done.
So we're just supposed to let people die
because some algorithm says that that's supposed to happen?
You realize how messed up that sounds, right?
You have a choice between saving one person
and saving an entire world. Every world.
I can do both. Spider-Man always--
Not always.
Miles, we all want to live the life we wish we had.
Believe me, I have tried.
And the harder I tried, the more damage I did.
You can't have it all, kid.
Being Spider-Man is a sacrifice.
That's the job.
That's what you signed up for.
[Peni] Miles.
[Miles] Peni?
What is this?
Is this is an intervention or something?
We know it's hard.
But it's the truth, Miles.
Is that why you're here? To let me down easy?
It worked last time, why not run it back, huh?
-Hey, hold on. Hold on. -You were right, Gwen.
-You should've never come to see me. -Kid, look at--
-You should've never come to see me. -Kid, look at-- Stop calling me that.
-There we go. -Hobie, not helping.
-Good. -Miles, please understand.
-Good. -Miles, please understand. You can't ask me not to save my father.
I'm not asking.
Just give him a second, please. -This is a great look. -Don't! Stop it!
-This is a great look. -Don't! Stop it!
If we let him leave, he'll only do more damage. We both know that.
Little man. Peter Pan. Palms.
Little man. Peter Pan. Palms. [Miguel] Just need to hold you a few days. Sorry it had to end like this, kid.
[Miguel] Just need to hold you a few days. Sorry it had to end like this, kid.
I said not to call me that!
-[dramatic music playing] -Miles!
All right.
I'm sorry for doing this. This is bad parenting.
Just for the record, I quit.
[Miguel over PA] All stations, drop what you're doing and stop Spider-Man.
-You? -You? -Me? -Me?
[in English] Miles! Miles Morales! He's entering Sector 4!
-Is that him? -Do I, uh, have web on my face?
-Is that him? -Do I, uh, have web on my face? What's the deal?
[Miguel] Miles! He's right there. He's right in-- -Turn around! -I don't see anything, boss.
-Turn around! -I don't see anything, boss.
Can this day get any damn weirder?
Wow! I guess it can.
-Whoa! -Sorry!
And then I looked at my uncle, and...
Uh, let me guess. He died?
On the count of three, draw.
One-- You didn't wait for three!
Hey, Miguel!
Can you take a photo of this? It's her first chase.
-[Spider-Being yelling] -[prisoners booing]
Boo.
-[female Spider] Miles? -[Miles] Hi.
-I'm a huge fan of your work. -Thanks.
Do you think Spider-People too often use comedy as a crutch? -Uh... -Get it? "Crutch"?
-Uh... -Get it? "Crutch"?
-I can do anything he can. -[dramatic sting plays]
Oh, dang, I pulled something.
-[Dr. Octopus] Hello, Peter. -[Miles yells]
There's nowhere to run.
My bad, everybody. There was somewhere to run.
-[Miguel] Stop running! -Then stop chasing me!
-[Miguel] Stop running! -Then stop chasing me! [Miguel] You're so frustrating.
I know he's your friend, but it's the only way.
-But my gut says-- -Then use your head.
[Ben Reilly] I've got you trapped in my well-defined musculature.
So don't even-- [yells]
Miles.
-No, no. Let me go. -It is crazy to run.
Running is the least crazy thing going on.
-Look, I feel bad. -Good!
But this is just how stuff works. You're not gonna win here.
Just wait, don't move. Stop moving so fast.
No!
-Do you wanna hold my baby? -What?
Would you just give the baby one squeeze and then we'll talk?
I think it's gonna change our vibe. It's very rejuvenating. I'm plenty juvenated.
I'm plenty juvenated.
You'll get more so when you go chest-to-chest with this magical child.
You don't get to have a heartfelt conversation with me.
Just hold the baby, we'll see what happens!
You're the reason I had her, okay?
I thought that if I did a decent job raising her,
then there was a chance she was gonna turn out like you.
And that got me excited because you are a wonderful person.
-And I like being around you. -[poignant, pensive music playing]
Then why didn't you come see me?
Bec--
I couldn't.
I wanted to be with you guys so badly.
But this thing isn't what I thought it was.
Look, bad things are gonna happen.
It makes us who we are.
But good things happen too, you know?
Like you happened.
And she happened.
Hey, I don't...
And you are so bad at holding a baby.
-[LYLA] We got your location, Peter. -Wait, wait. No, no!
You do not have my location. Over.
Send everyone.
No, no, no, Miles, I didn't know. I promise you.
Please, man, let's talk about this.
We did.
Good talk.
[Spider-Man] Get him!
[Gwen] Miles!
-Where does he think he's going? -[Peter] Don't think he planned this out.
If I hadn't said it before, by the way,
you're a terrible mentor.
He did just beat you, so I'm not a terrible mentor.
[Miguel] You're both equally terrible. Does that settle it?
Stop pretending you know where you're going!
[Miles] Oh, I have a plan. I just haven't told you yet.
-[LYLA] Departing for the moon. -That's not good.
What are those, claws?
Dude, are you sure you're even Spider-Man?
[Miguel] Are you?
Who do you think you are? Really?
My name is Miles Morales.
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.
And I'm pretty sure you know the rest, jerk!
Hey. What's up, man?
[Miguel] You don't get it. You're an anomaly.
Not if you let me go home.
[Miles] Snitch!
[Miguel] Everywhere you go, you're an anomaly.
You're the original anomaly.
Miguel!
[Miguel] The spider that gave you your powers wasn't from your dimension.
It was never supposed to bite you.
Miguel, don't!
[Miguel] There's a world out there with no Spider-Man to protect them
-because it bit you instead. -No.
[Miguel] You're not supposed to be Spider-Man.
No! You're lying. I'm Spider-Man!
[Miguel] You're a mistake!
If you hadn't been bit, your Peter Parker would have lived.
Instead, he died saving you.
He would've stopped the collider before it ever went off.
Spot wouldn't exist.
-And none of this would've happened. -Peter. [groans]
And all this time, I have been the only one holding it all together.
-[Peter] Miguel, go easy on him! -You don't belong here.
You never did.
Let me go. -Miguel, that's enough. -This isn't what we talked about.
-Miguel, that's enough. -This isn't what we talked about.
You talked about this?
You knew?
You all knew?
I didn't know...
how to tell you.
That's why you never came to see me.
-Miles, it's for your own good. -Who decides that?
I'm not a kid, Gwen.
That's exactly what you are.
You're just a kid who has no idea what he's doing!
Yeah, well, I did lure hundreds of Spider-People away from your little clubhouse.
What?
I guess he did plan this out.
And I'm about to do this.
Everyone keeps telling me how my story is supposed to go.
Nah.
I'm gonna do my own thing.
Goodbye, Gwen.
Miles!
I taught him how to do that, so I gotta be a pretty good mentor to pull that off.
so I gotta be a pretty good mentor to pull that off.
Nope. No. Uh-uh.
That's kind of cute. Oh, no. Mm-mm.
Been there. Done that.
[automated voice] Initializing Go Home Machine.
Dimensional signature identified.
Come on.
No. No.
-Oh, no. -No.
What's happening?
The machine activated on its own.
-How is that possible? -It isn't.
It's not possible for the accelerator protocol to engage without entering a sequence key.
-Okay. Which...? -Which it's doing right now.
-How about this? -No.
-How about now? -You're getting in the way.
Stop him! Now!
What does it look like I'm trying to do?
Do something.
Now!
[Peter] Miguel.
[Gwen] Miguel, stop!
No!
Okay. Enough. It's not the console's fault.
[Miguel] All he had to do was listen!
-Why didn't he listen? -Maybe you weren't hard enough.
-Why didn't he listen? -Maybe you weren't hard enough. -Gwen, don't do it. -[Miguel] You let him go.
-Gwen, don't do it. -[Miguel] You let him go.
-Me? -You didn't catch him, Gwen.
-Okay, let's all just take a breath. -Peter, you wanna back me up?
Well, okay, Miguel, as a father of a daughter and the son of a mother--
-Yeah, actually, stop talking. -Okay, duly noted.
Let me just talk to him.
We tried that.
-He's my friend. -Yeah. And that's the problem.
Do you know for certain what happens if he breaks the canon?
Do you wanna find out? I told you she was a liability.
You're wrong.
Jess, tell him he's wrong.
He's not.
Are you serious right now?
I told you. You let him get away, I can't help you.
I'm not coming.
You're right.
What...?
What the hell?
Go home, Gwen.
We are supposed to be the good guys.
We are.
We are.
Jess, Ben. Come with me.
Hell, yeah.
[Miguel] And somebody catch Spot.
Yeah. Sorry. I gotta get her down for her nap.
Not you. I've had the right amount of you.
Hey, hon.
How was work?
[Peter] I don't know.
Peter? Did you bring our baby to another fight?
Did I bring our ba--? No. No, no.
'Cause you asked me not to. So I didn't. I wouldn't.
Access denied. Access denied.
You think I'll be any good at this?
You're asking that now?
There's no playbook for raising someone like her...
or being someone like you.
You just gotta make the right adjustments at halftime.
-That's a sports metaphor, by the way. -I understand.
Sorry. You were just such a nerd in high school. I figured--
But I have watched sports.
-Okay, champ. -Unbelievable.
Wanna go easy on the penguin?
Would you just...?
You gonna even look at me?
What? What is that?
[Gwen] I'm looking at you. Like you asked.
You look skinny.
Where have you been? Just been, uh, out murdering all my friends.
Just been, uh, out murdering all my friends.
Oh, that's funny, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay.
-[Gwen] Where are you going? -I don't know.
You're a good cop, Dad.
You put on that badge because you know if you don't,
someone who shouldn't will.
But you have to understand,
this mask is my badge.
And I'm trying to be good too.
I was trying so hard
to wear this thing the way you would want...
and I didn't.
I didn't.
I can do all these things, but I can't help the people I love the most.
And they can only know half of who I am.
So I'm completely on my own.
And now I don't even know what the right thing is anymore.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do. But I know...
I can't lose one more friend.
Gwen, I always taught you to do it by the book.
And how did that work out?
-I took an oath. -Then arrest me, Dad.
-Get it over with. -I... I can't.
Why not?
Because I quit.
When?
About halfway through your big speech.
You're...
Wait a minute, you're not gonna be captain?
That means...
My job, being captain,
this whole thing doesn't matter anymore.
You're the best thing I've ever done.
-It was a good speech, huh? -No wonder you got an A in English.
B. I got a B-plus.
Missed a few classes.
I don't know what it is you gotta do...
but I think that this thing is supposed to help.
The guy who left it was a real piece of work.
I'll be right back.
Promise.
Parenting stuff is...
a big-ass mystery.
[Miguel] You're a mistake!
If you hadn't been bit, your Peter Parker would have lived.
And none of this would've happened.
[Spider-Ham] Miles, the hardest thing about this job is you can't always save everybody.
[Spot] I'll make you pay for everything you took away from me.
[Miguel] You have a choice between saving one person
and saving an entire world.
[Miles] I can do both. Spider-Man always--
[Peter] Not always.
[Rio] Whatever you're gonna do out there, don't get lost.
-[Peter] Bad things are gonna happen. -[Gwen] I didn't know how to tell you.
[Miguel] You were never supposed to be Spider-Man.
[Aaron] Keep going.
Did you check your locations?
-Yes, Dad. -No sign of him.
LYLA, would you send everyone out? Anywhere. Anywhere he might be.
Congrats, captain.
"Captain"? You can't call me that until I'm sworn in.
We're all proud of you. See you, jefe.
[Ben Reilly] Perfect pose.
Possible disturbance in the alley. Better go check it out.
Now I'm here in the alley. There's something unusual happening.
Looking at the walls. Those are normal.
But there's something in front of me. [yells]
I made it.
I'm home. -[music fades] -[laughs]
-[Rio] Miles? -[gasps]
Is now a bad time?
-Am I too late? -What'd you do to your hair?
Are you guys okay? Tell me you're okay.
I'm okay.
You were right. You were right about everything.
Of course I'm right. I'm always right.
-What am I right about? -I saw all these amazing places
and met all these amazing people, but... -[speaks in Spanish] -[sighs]
But they didn't want me.
I kept thinking about what you said.
And I let them have it, Mom.
I beat them all.
I know how strong I am now.
I'm strong because of you.
And Dad.
And us.
Mom.
There's something coming for us.
Something... Something terrible.
[in English] Miles, you're talking crazy. What's going on?
His name is Spot. He's my nemesis.
And I'm gonna stop him.
I know you know I've been lying to you.
It's because I thought if you knew...
you wouldn't love me the same.
And then I went out there and...
And now...
I'm not afraid of anything.
What do you wanna tell me?
Promise nothing's gonna change.
-Papá, I will always love you. -You gotta promise.
Always. I don't care what you say.
Mom.
I'm...
I'm Spider-Man.
Who's Spider-Man?
The superhero? He got bit by a spider?
Gave him spider powers?
He's me?
Is this where you dress up like your favorite character for...?
What's it called? Comics-Con?
I don't know what that is.
You really had me going there. Spider-Man. [speaks in Spanish]
Why don't you have eight arms? -Um... -Do you push silk out of your culito?
-I had a nightmare about that, but no. -Are you sure you woke up?
Mom, stop playing around. This is serious.
Dad worked with Spider-Man.
He didn't realize Spider-Man was me at the time, but...
-I wish Dad was here to explain. -Miles, please.
I got you to take care of, I got me to take care of, so help me out.
Mom, hold on, hold on. I need to talk--
Oh, no.
[Gwen] He's in the wrong universe.
[Miguel] The spider that gave you your powers wasn't from your dimension.
[automated voice] Dimensional signature identified.
[Miles] That machine...
didn't send me home.
Uncle Aaron?
Hey.
You okay?
I missed you so much.
[chuckles] Okay. All right, then.
-Whoa, you took your braids out? -Uh...
-On purpose? -Yeah.
Yeah, I'm still getting used to it?
They gave me more hours at the hospital, so next month I swear I'll pay you back.
Stop. Come on. We family.
Thanks.
-[Rio] Hey, honey, how you doing? -Hey. How'd it go with Miles?
-You know how you grounded him? -Mm-hm.
-I ungrounded him. -You what?
A little. I mean, how much trouble could he get into, right?
-[Jeff] A lot of trouble! -[Rio] I don't wanna think about it.
[Rio] Oh, Miles, I have to work an overnight tonight.
-Here's the grocery list. -I'll make sure he gets these done.
All right, we gotta roll.
Security switches out at 6. That's the window, right?
Right. Yeah.
I'm following you in what you are saying.
You all right?
I have a cold.
Come on, man.
Hey, you sure you got the plan?
Yeah, but maybe we should go over it one more time,
just to make sure there's no...
problems.
There's no Spider-Man here.
[Jeff] I'm sorry, baby, but you did unilaterally unground him.
[Rio] Jeff...
[Jeff] I just worry about him getting mixed up with the wrong people, okay?
This is probably that girl.
What is he even thinking, being with her?
I have some ideas.
-Baby, you're really not helping. -You saw the way he lit up around her.
I just hope she doesn't get him hurt.
[Jeff] I mean, am I responsible for this? -No, no. -Maybe it's all my fault.
-No, no. -Maybe it's all my fault.
Come on, papá, you're a great dad. This is hard.
This is hard.
It's like we got a whole new kid who just wants to grow up so fast.
And maybe we gotta grow up too.
A little bit.
Maybe we just gotta let him spread his wings, man.
"Man"?
[Gwen] It's not your fault.
It's mine.
Oh, come on. What the heck are you doing here?
Oh, uh, his window was open so I came in.
Because that's normal to do.
I wanna talk to your parents.
Right. My, uh, dad's kind of hard to get on the horn.
Oh, really? What does he do? Deal drugs?
He's a cop.
Statement withdrawn.
I'm gonna call the station.
I don't think he's there. Or anywhere around here.
-That's his jacket, emo. Where's Miles? -I don't know.
You don't know? What do you mean, you don't know?
Yeah, um, I'll leave.
Where do you think you're going, young lady?
[Gwen] I'm going to find him.
I don't know where, exactly.
But I know where to start.
One thing I learned from Miles:
It's all possible.
He loves you more than you could ever imagine.
I've seen it.
If you do find him...
tell him five months.
And tell him we love him.
You got it.
Uncle Aaron? [grunting]
Wait, wait.
Listen to me. Okay, look.
You don't understand. I'm not from here.
Listen, okay? This machine sent me here by mistake.
Wait, wait, wait. Please. Please.
Uncle Aaron, wait, wait, wait. Uncle Aaron!
Please. Uncle Aaron?
Just hear me out.
I was bit by a spider that gave me powers.
It wasn't supposed to bite me. It was supposed to bite someone else.
Someone from here.
I don't belong here. I need to go home.
Okay?
I have an Uncle Aaron too. I had one.
-He was a bad guy called the Prowler. -[device powers up]
He looked out for me.
He did a lot of bad things, but...
I knew he wanted to be good.
He just didn't know he had a choice, but you do.
You can be a good guy.
[Aaron] "A good guy"?
Please. Trust me. I know you don't wanna be the Prowler.
I'm not.
[Jonah on TV] Mayor Manfredi has extended New York's mandatory curfew
as the so-called Sinister Six cartels battle for control on the streets.
Is nobody gonna try and stop them?
Your dad is still alive?
What?
Your father.
You said he's still alive.
Yeah.
Who are you?
I'm Miles Morales.
But you...
You can call me the Prowler.
If I don't get home...
our dad is gonna die.
Your dad.
Please.
You have to let me go.
Why would I do that?
Don't tell Mom.
[Gwen] I never found the right band to join.
So I started my own.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the man who knows what you're gonna do before you do it.
The amazing Frank Cadillac!
Here's to world peace.
Good evening. Welcome to beautiful downtown Las Vegas.
How many people are here from the Orient? Raise your hands.
-[man coughs] -You, sir. Where are you from?
No, wait. Wait. Don't tell me. I'm sensing you must have soul.
You're a Seoul man.
Why don't you share with everyone where you're from?
-Korea. -How about that, folks?
And may I assume that this charming young lady is your daughter?
-She's my wife. -Well, of course she is!
And what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
-What's your name? -Yong Kyunge.
Yong Kyunge. Would you be kind enough to join me up on stage, please?
Are you serious about this guy? This a joke?
Want me to round up some mimes and clowns while we're at it?
[Cris] Yong Kyunge, what if I told you
that that pretty necklace you're wearing has a broken catch,
and on my count of three, will fall into your drink? Wouldn't that be something? Wouldn't that just blow your mind?
Wouldn't that be something? Wouldn't that just blow your mind?
-Yeah. -Yes!
Wouldn't it blow all your minds?
Three, two, one, now.
-Did somebody say "spooky"? -[audience applauding]
[Cris] Wait a minute. Look at your glass. Where'd it go?
Yong Kyunge, why don't you look inside my pocket? Reach in. Dig deep.
Let's have a big hand for Yong Kyunge.
Well, that's magic, folks, and that's why I'm here.
[Cris] You've probably seen a lot of those shows.
Mentalists, magicians, illusionists.
You'd be shocked to know that sometimes, not often, but sometimes, it's the real deal.
not often, but sometimes, it's the real deal.
Masquerading as an act. Hiding behind a few 50-dollar tricks.
Hiding in plain sight.
Because if the magician doesn't do that,
the alternative is impossible for others to live with.
Anyway, Wednesday night at the Back Page doesn't pay very well,
so I gamble.
But I don't play against other people. Only against the house.
So, no mega-jackpots, no long shots.
The idea is to go unnoticed. That way, I can keep coming back.
I'm not a god. I can't see everyone's future.
Only my own. And only within two minutes.
Except for when I saw her. But we'll come back to that.
[Roybal] There's no pattern to this guy. He's all over the map.
Well, he's not counting. Not off the top of a five-deck shoe.
Wait a minute. Isn't that that two-bit magic act over at the Back Page?
-What's his name? -Cadillac.
Yeah, that's Frank Cadillac.
[Roybal] Is he pulling tricks on us? Is that legal?
You can't trick the deck.
[Roybal] I'm telling you, that little prick knows what's coming.
If he's running that good a system, why is he not betting more?
That's gonna be my second question.
Look at that. He's looking right at us.
It's like he can hear us.
-[Roybal] What table was that? -Twenty-seven.
This is Roybal. Give me two men on table 27. I'm coming right down.
[dealer] Place your bets, please.
[Cris] Here's the thing about the future.
Every time you look at it, it changes because you looked at it.
-Hi. -[Cris] And that changes everything else.
[cashier] Nine thousand and seventy.
Empty the drawer. Move.
Drop the gun! Now!
[cashier] Hi.
Nine thousand and seventy.
Drop the gun! Step back!
It's his gun. He was gonna shoot two people!
Step back. We'll settle this right now. Hey!
[Davis] What's he doing?
Secure the doors, elevators, escalators, every way out of this damn place. Now!
[Davis] Freeman, seal off the blackjack tables. Sullivan, link up with Roybal.
We're on the floor. On the floor right now.
Bring up the other cameras.
That way. This way.
He's right next to you. Ten dollar slots, aisle 14.
[Davis] There he is. Behind you. Your left. Turn around!
He's right between you.
He's in the men's room near the gift shop. Gift shop!
Davis, where the hell is he?
Black T-shirt, straw hat. Heading towards the entrance.
Come on, let's go.
Call Vegas PD.
Just stole a silver Charger, tag 585 G4S.
-[Roybal] Drop the gun! Step back. -It's his gun.
He rose to the top of our gambling fraud wish list about two months ago.
What he does has nothing to do with luck. It's definable ability.
Look at him. He knows exactly what to do and not be caught.
Can you explain that to me?
No, I can't explain it, Callie, nor do I have the time.
The Russian Federation has a ten-kiloton nuclear munition unaccounted for.
I understand that.
I'm not sure you do.
We need every agent available beating the street.
That bomb was stolen five weeks ago. We've just been informed of it now.
Which means it could be parked under this truck for all we know.
I need actionable intelligence, not paranormals and bullshit magicians.
With all due respect, sir, this bullshit magician's shown a pattern of advanced awareness
this bullshit magician's shown a pattern of advanced awareness that is statistically impossible.
You let me bring him in, and you'll get what you want.
Five days, Callie. That's it.
Get me the head of casino security.
-You Roybal? -[enunciating] It's Roybal.
Whatever.
-Who are you? -Cavanaugh. Take a walk.
Hey, Roybal, this isn't a pissing contest. Come on.
-What'd you do? You got a new car? -Stole it.
[Irv] Look at this.
Twenty minutes to walk 20 steps.
Well, that's what you get from two packs a day.
Oh, hey, uh... Yeah. -I got you two sandwiches. -Two sandwiches?
-I got you two sandwiches. -Two sandwiches? -Ooh. That's 20 grand. -Come on, take it. I love you.
-Ooh. That's 20 grand. -Come on, take it. I love you.
Oh, jeez.
How can I repay you?
Must be a bitch to park this thing.
[Cavanaugh] Chief Roybal. Special Agent Ferris.
I'm sure Agent Cavanaugh has explained to you
that everything you say is admissible in court
and anything you knowingly admit can be used against you.
Do we understand each other?
-Sure. -Tell me about Cris Johnson.
-I don't know who that is. -How about Frank Cadillac?
You chased him out of your casino tonight. -He stole a car from valet parking. -Yeah, I know Cadillac.
-He stole a car from valet parking. -Yeah, I know Cadillac.
I thought he was cheating us at cards. Next thing I know, he's tackling some guy and waving a gun.
Well, the gun wasn't his. The man he tackled is wanted for two casino killings in Reno.
The man he tackled is wanted for two casino killings in Reno. He's in custody now.
Come on, I want to show you something.
You remember this?
Yeah, I do. We were saying he's looking right at us.
-Hey, how'd you get this? -Well, think carefully.
-Hey, how'd you get this? -Well, think carefully. What were you talking about right when he looked up?
We were saying, if he has a system, why isn't he betting more?
You sure you weren't doing or saying anything else?
I was going down to pick him up, I was reaching for my radio...
And right then? That's when he looked up? Be very specific.
That's what I said. He looked up, really.
So he doesn't have to be there to do it. Once you enter his consciousness, he can pick it up.
Is that to work his system?
Thank you. We're finished.
Done some good here, Mr. Roybal, but none of it is up for discussion.
Done some good here, Mr. Roybal, but none of it is up for discussion. Now, as far as you're concerned, Cris Johnson never existed.
That's gonna be difficult considering 100 cameras saw him at the casino.
Not to worry. Those tapes have been destroyed.
Hey. Is she single?
Cris, you can't keep stealing cars and having people chase you.
Cris, you can't keep stealing cars and having people chase you. That's not a life.
But you got to forget this girl that you keep seeing in your head.
I'm not going anywhere until I meet her.
Well, suppose she don't show up?
She already did, at the diner. Nine minutes after eight.
Well, you got a couple hours. How about a game of pool?
All right, Irv. We'll shoot some pool.
[man] We timed every hand of blackjack.
The longest was 89 seconds, when Johnson pulled a six-card 21.
So we know he can see at least a minute and a half ahead.
I had our techs run a radio frequency spectrum analysis.
Came up dry. He's not receiving any form of electronic help.
At one point, there was a two-minute 16-second delay.
He never bet, just got up and walked away.
Well, maybe 2:16's too long. He can't see that far.
-Narrows our window a little bit, anyway. -[door opening]
Got him. Vegas PD got a LoJack hit on the stolen vehicle.
Okay. Listen, about that girl.
When you looked at the clock, did you happen to see a calendar?
Because it could be ten years from now she gets hungry.
It's got to be soon.
I've never seen further ahead than two minutes. Except for her.
Now, what do you think the reason is for that?
I don't know. Maybe she doesn't scare easy.
Maybe she's the one.
Well, when you get like this, there's no talking to you.
She's almost here.
What happened to the diner?
-Somebody else, a cop. -A cop? Well, then, you got to go.
Hold on. I want to see how much she knows. What she wants from me.
Cris Johnson. Still here, huh?
Where else would I be?
Special Agent Ferris. Next time, steal a car without LoJack.
Can we speak privately?
Um, it's okay, Irv. Uh, go ahead. Thanks.
I'm sure you know why I'm here.
Because you're the man who knows what I'm gonna do before I do it, right?
Oh, the show, right. Right.
Oh, the show, right. Right. I saw you there.
Wonderful. You like magic tricks.
Yeah, yeah, I do like your magic tricks, clairvoyance...
Whatever you're calling it.
Let's talk about something hard.
A stolen nuclear munition is being smuggled into the United States,
or may, in fact, already be here.
I want you to look ahead and tell me where it's gonna be deployed.
[sighs] I think you've got the wrong guy. It's a... magic act.
You gonna stick with that story? 'Cause millions of lives are at risk
and you could, maybe, prevent a major catastrophe.
On a practical note, we're standing in front of a stolen vehicle, and you are wanted for assault involving a weapon at the casino.
[Cris] All right, that was an accident. He had a gun.
[Cris] All right, that was an accident. He had a gun. -He was gonna shoot two people. -Yeah?
How'd you know that?
No good deed goes unpunished, does it?
I can fix your legal problems, buddy, but you've got to step up.
Otherwise, your next magic show is gonna be at Folsom State Prison.
It's ironic, but...
people like you who try to help have been torturing me, in the full sense of the word, since I was three years old.
have been torturing me, in the full sense of the word, since I was three years old.
What did they call it?
Uh... Oh, yeah. Observed play therapy.
Featuring the marathon, 36-hour, can-you-guess-the-next-flash-card game.
So, please, leave me alone...
and let me live some semblance of a normal life.
I'd love to indulge your feelings, but I am dealing with a slightly larger picture right now.
Now, you can exercise your responsibility to help your fellow man,
or I will exercise that responsibility for you.
You're right. I got to go.
He's gone, right?
I missed him by seconds, didn't I?
Excuse me, honey, can you get off my car?
Yeah, thank you. Jeez.
[Smith] Mr. Roybal?
[enunciating] It's Roybal. Can I help you, man?
[Smith] I have a few questions if this is a good time.
Gaming Commission? It's after hours.
Gaming Commission? It's after hours. You guys should be at a strip club, right? Come on.
What can you tell us about Cris Johnson?
I don't know who you're talking about.
Let me rephrase the question.
-[waitress] Here you go, hon. -Thanks.
Excuse me. Hello.
I noticed you were alone, too. Do you mind if I join you?
Actually, I do.
Oh...
Sorry to bother you, but I have a question about the coffee.
The bean they use...
Isn't that something you should probably ask your waitress?
Yes, it is.
Excuse me, do you have a light?
I don't smoke.
-[waitress] Here you go, hon. -Thanks.
Please. Don't.
Hey, Liz.
Did you follow me here, Kendall?
No! No, I just thought we could talk.
We got really nothing to talk about.
And I told you that three weeks ago.
Liz, come on, all right? I-- I had an off day.
Just give me another shot.
It's not gonna happen. Okay? So maybe you should just go.
Do you know how hard it was to find you?
[inhales sharply] I was at your apartment. I tried the Starbucks on Lexington.
I was at the dry cleaner.
All I am asking for is a few minutes of your time
so that we can work things out.
-Okay, Jesus, you are stalking me now. -Don't...
Don't say that, please. [stammers] That's a terrible thing to say -to somebody. -Ugh.
Let go of me, Kendall.
Look, I just-- I thought we could talk, you know, maybe we could take a drive.
Look, I just-- I thought we could talk, you know, maybe we could take a drive. And now you are ruining it.
You're hurting me.
[Cris] Kendall, I think you're having another off day.
-Who the hell are you? -I'm her future.
Really? [chuckles]
Hi, my name's Cris.
You okay, Kendall?
See, the thing is, I feel connected to you. -[grunts] -I don't know the reason why.
-See, now, listen. -All right. I think it's only fair that you pay for the lady's breakfast.
I think it's only fair that you pay for the lady's breakfast. Yeah.
What were you having? Pecan pie is amazing.
-[coins clattering] -[Kendall groans] Excuse me, I can pay for my own breakfast.
And you know what? You two work things out.
You're hurting me.
Kendall, I think you're having another off day.
-Who the hell are you? -I'm her future.
Really? [chuckles]
-Incoming. -[grunts]
-[clatters] -[grunts] -[man] Did you see that? -[groans]
Goddamn it! Kendall!
What? Don't blame me. This is your fault.
Get out of here! Will somebody please call the cops?
I am so sorry. -Are you okay? Let me help you. -[stammers]
-Are you okay? Let me help you. -[stammers] Come on, let's get you cleaned up.
-[groans] -Come on.
[Cris] Oh, yeah, I'm seeing some stars.
Yeah.
[scoffs] I'm Liz.
Cris.
[sighs] You must have a death wish getting involved in that.
Here. Just...
-Okay. -Just...
-Okay. -Just... -[inhales sharply] -Hold it there for a little bit.
-[inhales sharply] -Hold it there for a little bit. -Okay. -Yeah.
It will.
-What will? -Your luck. It's gonna change.
[scoffs] What are you? A leprechaun?
Do leprechauns get punched in the face or have their car stolen?
Your car was stolen?
Yeah. I'm hoping they find it today.
I'm supposed to be in Flagstaff.
Hey, is this-- Is this tooth loose here?
Uh, I don't know. I don't think so.
Hurts.
Maybe I could give you a ride. I'm kind of going that way.
That would really be helpful, Liz. Thank you.
I do have to make a stop, though.
It's okay.
It might take a few hours, so if you're cool with that...
Hey, look, if you're uncomfortable with this, -I'll take the bus. -No, no, no.
-I'll take the bus. -No, no, no. [stammers] It's fine, it's fine. I mean, you're not a psycho.
Right?
Because the first psycho vibe I get, you're out of the car.
-Okay. Yes, ma'am. -[Liz] Okay.
-Deal. -["Así Será" plays]
[sighs] Deal.
It's amazing, isn't it?
I end up in a diner where you are,
and we're both headed in the same direction.
[chuckles] I don't know if I would call it amazing, but...
Destiny. That's what it really is.
Okay, I'm starting to get that psycho vibe.
Oh, no. You don't believe in destiny?
Well, even if it does exist, I don't think I want to know.
I mean, if every move we make is preordained,
then what is the point of that?
I mean, life is supposed to be a surprise.
Isn't it?
It would be nice.
Yeah.
[whispers] Yeah.
So he came in twice a day for a week at exactly nine past eight?
Yeah, he'd stay a few minutes, have a martini, and then he'd go.
'Til today, when he met that lady.
You didn't find anything strange about that?
Not strange enough to call the police.
We got a regular that counts the corn flakes in his bowl because it has to be an even number.
Got any cameras?
-Inside? No. -Outside?
No.
Did you notice what kind of car he was driving? Maybe overhear where they were going?
I don't know what car, but they were headed up to Flagstaff.
I don't know what car, but they were headed up to Flagstaff. -Flagstaff. -That's what they said.
Got another regular, she's always on a diet.
Brings in a scale and her own salad dressing.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
Guy knows we're after him, but he still risks coming here.
-8:09, twice a day. -Doesn't even know if it's day or night.
Just the time. He was waiting for her.
All right, there's a traffic cam over there, a bank, a 7-Eleven across the street.
Just run all the tapes. Maybe we'll get lucky
and catch him in wide.
Your buddy Roybal, the casino chief?
Had his throat cut last night after getting a kneecap shot off.
You're telling me this now? We just talked to him about Johnson.
-Hey, I just found out. -All right.
-Local weapon? -Dead end.
And forensics came up empty. Not a hair, not a fiber.
Somebody wants information.
Now, the next time anything happens relative to Johnson, I want to know right away. I don't care if it's a paper cut.
I want to know right away. I don't care if it's a paper cut.
Okay, boss.
The head of casino security, what did you learn from him?
For a macho guy, he screams like a girl.
But he was questioned by federal agents looking for Cris Johnson.
But he was questioned by federal agents looking for Cris Johnson. -Yes? -He said they haven't found him yet.
-Yes? -He said they haven't found him yet.
Do you believe this shit?
He can see things before they happen?
It makes no difference what I believe.
Look, we spent two years setting this up,
and that man out there is worried all this will be compromised by Johnson.
We're wasting our time looking for some magician.
We're being paid to secure the operation, Jones, not to hunt down some carnival barker.
not to hunt down some carnival barker.
Really? Then why are the same authorities
Really? Then why are the same authorities that are looking for us so interested in him?
Get rid of him.
Do it now.
-[speaks in Havasupai] -Hey.
Havasupai Reservation. I teach here once a week.
The conditions are pretty lousy.
But it's in the Canyon, one of the Eight Wonders of the World.
-Hey, Sam. -Hey, Liz.
Well, a couple hundred years ago, this tribe was booming.
Plenty of food and a thriving culture. They should be better off.
But I guess this was just their destiny.
I'd like to meet their shaman.
I read once that in many North American tribes
their shamans purpose wasn't only healing
but they also claimed to have power over the atmosphere.
-Mm-hmm. -To bring on or stop rain.
Even know future events.
-Mm-hmm. -Do you think that's possible?
Well, I believe anything is possible.
Me, too.
-Whose birthday? -One of my students.
Hey! Hi!
-How's it going? -[children laughing]
Hello! How is everybody? Good?
-That's good. -Oh, I was close.
That was a lot. You messed up on the last part.
On the last part. Yeah. [laughs]
I thought you weren't coming back until next Monday.
Well, I'm not, but it's Jake's birthday. How could I miss that?
Who's that man you're with?
Is he your boyfriend?
No, no, he's not my boyfriend. He's just my friend.
I think he likes you.
Well, why would you say that?
Because he looked at you like my brother looks at his girlfriend.
Hey, Jake, you want to see some magic? I'll show you something. Come here.
I found this rock out in the Canyon and I want you to hold it because it's a magic rock.
and I want you to hold it because it's a magic rock. That's right. Hold it really tight. Keep squeezing.
It's magic.
He won't bite.
Happy birthday.
So, you're a magician?
I have a small magic act back in Vegas.
The Frank Cadillac Show.
-I thought your name was Cris. -It is.
Frank Cadillac is my stage name.
How did you come up with that?
I picked two things I really liked and I put them together.
Frankenstein and Cadillacs.
You are odd.
Charming... but odd.
[man] Cease fire! Visitor on the range!
Nice. A little close, though.
-[gunfire] -[casing clacking] Okay.
You were right about the traffic cam. We got a positive ID.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
It's okay.
Did I drool?
-Drool? -Yeah.
Wha-- Drool? No.
Oh, my God, it's coming down so hard.
-Yeah. -[yawns]
I like rain.
I like rain, too.
You know, once, I think it was in Denmark, it rained fish.
Because the sun dehydrated the water and took it up into the atmosphere,
re-hydrated the fish eggs and they hatched and it rained fish.
-Is that true? -Yeah, in the clouds.
-Is that true? -Yeah, in the clouds. -[laughs] -True story. It happened 50 years ago.
-I just felt like sharing that with you. -[both laugh]
Road's washed out ahead. You can't cross till morning.
Not even then if this keeps up.
You want to spin around and go back about two miles, take your second left. There'll be a motel there called--
take your second left. There'll be a motel there called--
The Cliffhanger. Thanks.
Right.
Him, right?
That's it? [clicks tongue]
That's it? [clicks tongue] There's no front plate. Where's the other side?
[Cavanaugh] I don't have it.
Wha-- What was that on the front window? Go back.
Back, back.
Back. There! Zoom in.
That's a permit. Track it, you'll find her.
I'll light a fire.
Um, Cris, one little problem.
Oh, no, no. No, no, no. I'm gonna sleep in the car.
Okay.
-Here. -Oh.
-Thanks. -Sure.
Hey, did you hear the joke about the Zen master who ordered the hot dog?
No.
He said he'd have one with everything.
-Good night. -Good night.
What do we have?
They're at the Cliffhanger Motel outside Flagstaff.
We found an Arizona DOT foreman who remembered the Land Cruiser.
-Why would he do that? -The road was flooded.
-Why would he do that? -The road was flooded. He was about to suggest a place to stay.
-But Johnson already knew. Right? -Exactly.
Callie. It just got worse.
All right, people, we've got a nuclear alert.
All right, people, we've got a nuclear alert. Code Red, in the Southern California region.
L.A. to San Diego, 95 percent certainty.
Nuclear emergency search teams are on the way, but until they get here,
can somebody please tell me what my agency, the FBI, is doing about it?
Well, sir, tier-one suspects have been interrogated.
Cars and premises have been checked, friends and acquaintances. We've opened up surveillance on tier-two and -three suspects,
but nothing actionable yet.
Is that what we're doing, waiting for something actionable?
There are eight million lives that are precarious at best.
So I say we widen the net to "slightly suspicious" and get some decent intel before this nuke blows up Los Angeles.
and get some decent intel before this nuke blows up Los Angeles.
All right, Callie. What do you propose we do next?
I believe that the urgency of this situation
compels the use of any and all resources to obtain Cris Johnson.
We know where he is. Let my team pick him up.
[in English] He said they're mobilizing.
Standard procedure when security is escalated.
Tell him to wrap it up. They'll lead us straight to Johnson.
-[in English] Okay. [speaks in French] -[phone beeps]
You hungry? There's a coffee shop down the road.
[Cris] I'd rather eat here, if that's okay.
Sure.
-What? -[stammers]
There's an Italian painter named Carlotti,
and, uh, [clears throat] he defined beauty.
He said it was the summation of the parts working together in such a way
that nothing needed to be added, taken away or altered.
That's you.
You're beautiful.
That was incredible.
What was?
This.
Right here gives us a good standoff position
and open view of the front of the motel.
We can run multiple point and area surveillances from this road here, that turn out.
Get a team with a parabolic set right here.
That's fine, but I also want mobile surveillance.
And give me two or three roamers. If he rabbits on us, -I want to be flexible. -[phone rings]
Ferris.
Call the local police in Flagstaff.
Tell them to hold the outside perimeter.
I want that area locked down.
A body turned up in an apartment with a line of sight to my office.
Slit throat, like Roybal.
Somebody's trying to follow us to Johnson.
[whispers] Cris.
Yeah.
Maybe there is such a thing as destiny.
Give it 40 seconds.
So, after two minutes, he just stops seeing what's gonna happen?
I sure as hell hope so.
Elizabeth Cooper?
-Yeah. -Federal Agent Ferris.
Um, what is this about?
I'm gonna need a few minutes of your time.
Yeah, okay.
They're putting her in the car.
-[clattering] -[indistinct chatter and yelling] [Roybal] Drop the gun! Step back.
[Cris] It's his gun. He was gonna shoot two people!
This was three days ago?
He used you to get away from us in Vegas.
You can be pretty sure that everything he told you is a lie.
He's delusional. A sociopath.
[Liz] Oh, my God. [sighing] Oh, my God.
Oh, shit. [sighing] Oh, shit.
[Cavanaugh] Go back to the motel. Have a drink. Put one of these in his glass.
It'll take five minutes to put him to sleep.
Then we'll come in and get him. Nobody's been hurt.
But this is important. You need to do it at least two minutes
after you get him out of the room.
Wha-- [sighs] Why do you need me? Why can't you just get him?
Liz, as I understand it, you work for a federally-funded program
Liz, as I understand it, you work for a federally-funded program teaching on various reservations. Is that true?
Yes, that's true.
Well, I'd think you'd be eager to help us. We're on the same team.
Now they're letting her go.
-Uh, thanks for the note. -Sure.
[sighs] Did you have a nice walk?
I did. You know, it's-- It's really beautiful here. [chuckles]
-I have a present for you. -Oh.
-Oh, thanks. Hey. I need that. -Yeah.
Is something wrong?
Oh, no, no, I'm fine.
Why don't you go wash up, and I'm gonna make us breakfast.
-Okay. -Okay.
Forty-five seconds.
A minute-thirty.
And that's two.
-Looks good. -You think so?
-Thank you. -Mm-hmm.
[sighs] Don't drink that!
[crying] Oh, God, I don't know what I'm doing. I have no idea what I'm doing.
Some federal agent came up to me
and said that you were a delusional sociopath
and showed me this tape. So maybe you are.
But I don't wanna believe that. I don't think I can believe that.
And she also said that if you ran, they would shoot you.
So I should drug you instead and I, uh...
Even if what they said is true, I don't want you to die.
[inhales] I don't want you to die.
[whispering] Cris, is it true?
Oh, shit.
Get me broadband noise reduction. I don't like hearin' this!
Speak quietly and act normally.
How long did they say the drugs would take?
-that left. -About five minutes.
What is he doing?
[Cavanaugh] He's drinking. Give it a minute.
Got a clean shot?
Not yet.
The man in that casino would have killed two people.
It happened. It just hadn't happened yet.
[announcer 2] Forrest Griffin wins by knockout. [whispering] Oh, my God, you are delusional.
"Fluffy cranberry or a stack of chocolate chip pancakes for the kids."
[man on TV 1] Fluffy cranberry
or a stack of chocolate chip pancakes for the kids in an instant.
"Safe? Who knows what's safe?
I knew a man who dropped dead from looking at his wife."
Safe. Who knows what's safe?
-[sighs] -I knew a man dropped dead from looking at his wife.
"You can't get lost in the woods if you never go into the woods."
You can't get lost in the woods if you never go into the woods.
[cartoon character] Boy, you got an answer for everything. -[sighs] -[cartoon skunk] Yep.
"That's right, sir. You're the only person authorized to do so."
Uh, that's right, sir. You are the only person authorized to do so.
How are you doing this?
I have no idea how, but I can.
I was born with it.
[chuckles] Is this some kind of a trick?
You know we don't have time for that.
You said anything was possible.
So, you see things before they happen?
You see the future? My future. What'll affect me, and only two minutes ahead.
My future. What'll affect me, and only two minutes ahead.
Except you. For some reason, I saw you.
I-- For some reason, I saw you far beyond anything I'd ever seen before and I don't know why.
I saw you far beyond anything I'd ever seen before and I don't know why.
What do you mean, you saw me?
You've been-- You've been doing that to me?
That-- That you know what I'm gonna do and what I'm gonna say,
-that you've just been setting me up? -No, I haven't.
I wanted to find you because I needed to know why I was seeing you.
-And-- and because I-- I... [sighs] -[gasps]
It wasn't a setup.
What do they want from you?
They think I can help them in matters of national security.
[whispering] I don't understand. If you can help, then why don't you?
Because I can't.
I can only give 'em a two-minute head start.
And that's if my life is personally involved.
-But with me, you can see further. -Yeah.
But they don't know that.
There's almost ten thousand dollars in this envelope.
They know about you. You need to get away from here.
[Cris] What time do you have?
-9:10. -Set your watch to 9:17.
Read this when I leave and wait exactly 45 seconds
Read this when I leave and wait exactly 45 seconds before you do what it says. I'll take Ferris with me.
before you do what it says. I'll take Ferris with me.
It might be a week or a month,
but if you can wait, I'll find you.
Something's wrong.
Don't do it.
I already have.
Go get him! Alive!
-[JTTF agent 1] Let's go! -[JTTF agent 2 indistinct chatter]
-[speaks in French] -[grunts]
Are you crazy?
[JTTF agent 1] Oh, shit! Come on! [JTTF agent 1] Go! Get the fuck--
[Ferris] Johnson!
You know you're not gonna shoot.
You gonna let me die?
Hey, I need some help! -[Ferris] Let's get him out of here! -[grunting, panting]
-Ferris] Let's get him out of here. -[Cavanaugh grunting] I got him.
You all right? You okay? Open your eyes. Look at me.
No good deed goes unpunished, does it?
-She got him. -Now what?
-[cellphone rings] -[Mr. Smith] You see her?
Smoke?
Thanks for today.
Could've let me die. I appreciate it.
That was a real show of character.
I know I seem like the bad guy in all this,
I know I seem like the bad guy in all this, but in the interests of preserving our freedom,
there are larger issues at play.
What about my freedom?
With freedom comes responsibility.
I... have rights.
This isn't about you. This is about eight million other people.
[panting] If I do what you want, you'll keep me in this chair forever.
There is a nuclear bomb somewhere in Los Angeles.
And every television station in the world will broadcast
And every television station in the world will broadcast the precise details of its detonation.
So, go on push that two minutes as far as you can. And find it.
[male news anchor] We're interrupting your broadcast this afternoon for breaking news out of downtown Los Angeles.
Most of the nation's largest technology corporations oppose this idea
and tech lobbying is blamed for stalling the proposed [distorted] rate structure.
...members of the LAPD bomb squad are staging in that area.
We want to go live now to reporter Lisa Joyner at the scene for the very latest. Lisa.
at the scene for the very latest. Lisa.
Jeff, the standoff began when police received an anonymous phone call
stating that explosives would be detonated at this parking garage
stating that explosives would be detonated at this parking garage at Second and Broadway at six o'clock tonight.
There's no, uh-- They have no idea on a motive.
[Lisa] The, uh, victim, however, -has been identified... -Liz, I'm sorry.
-...as Elizabeth Cooper of Las Vegas. -What?
-Now, earlier in our coverage you... -What did you say?
...saw the LAPD has surrounded the area. They've secured a perimeter.
But now the bomb squad is making their way onto the, uh, [stammers] the deck of this building.
And the men... men that are walking up with black suits on and such...
Oh, my God.
Um... Th-- There's been-- There's been an explosion. -There's been an explosion. Uh... -[panting]
-There's been an explosion. Uh... -[panting]
The-- The victim has been identified as Elizabeth Cooper of Las Vegas.
And, uh, she was, uh, strapped to a, uh, wheelchair.
Sorry?
Approximately ten percent of U.S. workers receive stock options.
Many technology companies give the options away as part of their...
Tell me what just happened.
Yeah, I-- I can't. It won't work like this.
Just get me out of this room, and I'll do what you want.
I beg you, please get me out of this room.
-Let him out! -[panting]
-Callie! Callie, wait up. -What?
Forensics report on Betty Peterson.
The dead girl in the apartment?
Her throat was cut, bled out. Otherwise, nothin' to DNA. The place was immaculate again. How'd it go with Johnson?
The place was immaculate again. How'd it go with Johnson?
Well, something happened, but he's not sharing.
You know, there are traces of potassium iodide.
Some medication Peterson was taking?
-They found an empty pillbox. -No.
-They found an empty pillbox. -No. The only reason to take it is to prevent radiation poisoning.
Oh, hey, wait, wait. Can I get a smoke or something? I need to relax.
Thanks.
Oh, hey, can I get a light?
[pilot] Base, Air One. Base, Air One. I've got visual.
Subject is spotted heading south on 5th Street.
Be advised, subject is turning east onto Broadway.
Stay here. Let me deal with this.
Why are you here?
They killed her.
Two hours from now.
They killed Liz.
Tell me what you saw.
I saw them execute her.
Right there. On the roof.
It hasn't happened yet, and I know who has her.
It's the same people we're after.
There's a reason that they brought you here. They're using Liz as bait.
Ten to one you go out on that roof, they're going to put a bullet in your brain.
I know.
Right now, she's still alive.
She is, you are, we all are. Let's try to keep it that way.
I help you, you help me, all right?
I want a two-mile radius. Every telephone grid, shortwave, cell tower. Shut it down.
What do you want me to do?
Let him shoot you.
[operator] Your call cannot be completed as dialed. Check the number and dial again.
-[mouths] Fuck. -[beeping] [operator] Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
-[whirring] -FBI! Down on your knees!
[Callie] You okay? That looked pretty close.
Sleight of hand.
-You didn't get him. -Not alive. He fired on the chopper.
But it doesn't matter. He couldn't call in the hit.
So as far as they're concerned, you're not here yet.
It buys us time.
Every way I try this, she still ends up dead.
What if you do it earlier?
They have to bring her here in a vehicle, right?
-Looking for a license plate. -Right.
Can you see it?
It helps if you don't speak right now.
California plate number 50KF272.
California tag, five, zero, kilo, foxtrot, two, seven, two.
-Please, where are you taking me? -[speaking in German]
What do you want with me?
Who the hell are you people?
Sitrep, Cavanaugh.
Local SWAT has been deployed
and the regional team just showed to back us up.
All right, listen up. A van carrying Elizabeth Cooper will exit the warehouse
A van carrying Elizabeth Cooper will exit the warehouse
across from Pier 18 compound in approximately five minutes.
Four minutes and 27 seconds.
-Do you mind? -Not anymore. Go ahead.
They've got her wrapped in explosives, wired to a cell phone.
Remote trigger. Another cell phone sets it off. Usually a one-button speed dial.
They'll take this route to the entrance gate.
At that point, Alpha and Bravo will swarm the entrance--
If you could just be quiet and do exactly what I say,
I'll save your life.
We need to stop the vehicle here before they get through the gates.
Alpha and Bravo will hold and contain here.
Sniper teams will initiate on Johnson's call.
On his call. Are we clear?
-All elements shoot to kill any hostiles. -What about intel?
We don't need them. We have him.
All right, everybody! Let's go!
-Go! Let's go! Move! -[gunfire]
-Back up! -[sirens blaring]
Go, go, go!
-[agent] Stop the van. -Not yet. You'll kill her.
-Now. -[gunfire]
[pilot] You're good to go! Now!
Move back! Move back!
Take out the guy on the crane, northeast corner.
-Negative on a visual. -Give me that.
[Cris] Aim for the doorway, eight inches above the guardrail.
On me, let's go!
-[speaks in German] -[gun cocks]
[JTTF sniper] Zed David, Charlie One at entry point.
Turn right.
You're clear.
[pilot] You're good! Go! Go!
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
[pilot] Number 2 loading dock.
Stop.
-No! -[groaning]
Go.
[sniper] This is Charlie One element, moving and clearing, over.
[whispers] Thanks.
There are explosives there, there and there. Stay close.
-Sniper. -Where? -Behind us. -Sniper, six o'clock.
-Behind us. -Sniper, six o'clock.
-Got a visual? -Nobody move! I'll find him.
Catwalk, second level.
Catwalk, six o'clock. Second level.
-Got him. -[gunfire]
-We'll have to clear this deck by deck. -You take this one. I'll do the rest.
Let's sweep and clear.
She's near the engine room.
[Callie] Come on, man. Release the hostage. You can still get out of this.
Don't patronize me.
-How good are you with that gun? -Very.
You're gonna be okay, Liz.
-Back off! -[panting]
I've seen every possible ending here.
None of them are good for you.
I'll take my chances.
One more step, fortune teller, and it definitely won't be good for you.
You have one way out of this.
-That wasn't it. -[grunts]
-[panting] -[Cris] Liz, look at me. It's okay. Look at me. It's over.
It's over.
No, it's not.
The nuclear device was moved. We need to find its exact location.
Now, this registers any significant detonation in the Earth's crust.
Now, this registers any significant detonation in the Earth's crust. Take a look. Tell me what you see.
[Cris] Something's wrong. I...
I made a mistake.
-What? -I made a mistake.
-It's happening. -When?
-It's happening. -When? Now!
I got four teams in place. We're just waiting on the road crew. -All right. -[phone ringing]
-Ferris. -It's me.
I'll do it, but I have conditions.
I want her left out of it.
I'm sure we can work something out.
-Liz? -[moans]
Liz?
[groans] Come back to bed.
I got to go.
Go where?
There's something I have to do. I can't put it off any longer.
Are you coming back?
Yeah.
It may be a week or a month.
But if you can wait, I'll find you.
[Cris] Here's the thing about the future.
Every time you look at it, it changes because you looked at it.
And that changes everything else.
Finland and the Soviet Union have signed the Moscow Armistice,
which decrees that Finland must disarm the Nazis and drive them out of Lapland.
The Nazis adopt a scorched-earth tactic
and destroy all roads, bridges, villages, and towns in their path.
Deep in the wilderness of Lapland, there is a man who has decided
to leave the war behind him.
For good.
Yeah!
He's riding to his death anyway.
Get off the horse!
Where you think you're going, old man? There's nothing down there.
We made sure of that.
What do you got there?
This old fucker is a gold miner.
You got gold in those bags?
-[laughs] -Take a look at this!
-We're rich, boys! -[whines]
-[soldier 1] You're dead! -[soldier 2 laughs]
Get down on your knees.
[soldier 1] These bags are full of gold!
Get down on your knees, grandpa!
[soldier 1] Shoot the fucker!
-[chuckles] -[soldier 2] Fuck him up!
[soldier 2] Thanks for the gold!
We've got gold!
Thank you, old fuck--
Wait.
Now.
Fire!
Cease fire!
You...
and you.
On the sides of the road now!
How many mines did we bury here?
All of them.
Pick two of our female friends and bring them to me.
And some rope.
You...
and you.
Pick me.
[Wolf] Thank you, general.
I will pass on the information.
Over and out.
The general, he has given us orders.
Turn back and head to Norway from Finland immediately.
Did you tell him he just killed seven of our men?
I did.
And?
He thinks we were lucky.
Fucking lucky.
The dog tags belong to a man named Aatami Korpi.
He was a Finnish commando.
The most feared in his unit.
The general said, and I quote:
"He's one mean motherfucker that you do not want to mess with."
He fought in the Winter War.
Lost his home and his family to the Russians.
He became a ruthless, vengeful soldier who took orders from no one.
The Finns, they gave up trying to discipline or control him.
They'd just send him out, alone, into the wilderness,
to hunt Russian patrols.
He became a one-man death squad.
[Wolf] The reports are unconfirmed,
but it looks like he has over 300 Russian kills.
The Russians...
they gave him a name.
They call him Koschei...
the Immortal.
Immortal.
The road is clear, sir.
We are going to follow our orders, right?
We are turning back?
No.
We are not turning back.
We are losing the war. We are.
In a few months, this all will be over for us.
When we get back, they will...
hang us all.
That gold is our way out.
[soldier 1] Eyes open!
Check the sides.
[soldier 2] Nothing here.
[soldier 2] Don't wait. Let's keep moving.
Don't fall behind!
Hey, hey. Hey.
Gasoline!
[soldier 1] The dogs lost the scent!
[Bruno] What's happening?
-[dogs bark, then whining] -[soldier 1] There's gasoline on the road.
[Bruno] They are useless.
[Bruno] Calm down, boy.
[soldier 1] Hey!
Release the dog.
-[soldier 1] Release the dog! -[soldier 2] Go on, boy!
Finish him.
[Bruno] Immortal or not, a man needs air.
[Bruno] Now, get me the gold.
Go after him! Now!
One more meter and I'll have you shot!
Desertion is punishable by death.
Fuck this.
Come on, here. [shushing]
Find me a boat.
Any last words?
I didn't think so.
For your troubles.
[Bruno] Put the hat back on.
This son of a bitch is still alive.
Shoot the man. Shoot the dog too.
And the dog!
Shoot the fucking dog!
Müller?
Müller?
The plane is ready.
What about the rest of our squad?
They don't need us to get to Norway.
The boys have a crateful of booze and a truck full of bitches.
I'm sure they'll figure something out.
I would.
[soldier 1] The road is blocked. Come and take a look at this.
[soldier 2] What's going on?
[soldier 1] There's something in the road.
Is this the plane?
No, idiot.
This is something else.
The pilot has been hanged.
-That's my rope. -What?
That's the rope I used to hang Korpi with.
[soldier 1] Can you see anything?
Let's get the fuck out of here.
[soldier 1] What's happening?
I recognize it, I swear.
-[soldier 2] What's the order? -Everybody move!
[soldier 3] Start the engines.
[soldier 1] Come on, let's go.
[soldier 1] Let's go, go!
Well?
He's back.
He's hanging from a rope somewhere. He's dead.
-What's so fucking funny? -Nothing.
What the fuck are you smiling for, then?
Do you assholes really think you have succeeded
where hundreds of Russians have died trying?
We all know the story.
You'll see what happens when you take everything from him.
He won't give up.
He'll just keep coming back.
Do you really believe that he's immortal?
No.
He just refuses to die.
We have a word for that in Finland, but it's impossible to translate.
You see, this is not about who's the strongest.
This is about not giving up.
And he won't.
Ever.
No matter what you bitches are trying.
You only will make him stronger.
So...
what is so fucking funny...
is that you...
your boyfriend...
and everything that is left of your sorry-ass company...
are already dead.
What?
Was that one of ours?
Was that Jens?
We almost ran into the bitches.
Can somebody tell me what the fuck is going on?
Nothing. It's all good, sir.
Sir, they're all dead.
We are almost there. Step on it!
Wolf...
go out there and kill him.
One, two...
three!
Keep going!
Keep going.
Please, please.
That's him. That's Koschei.
[Bruno] Do you see him?
Yep. He's still down there.
It's bad. It's bad, I need--
If you're not dead, you fly this fucking plane!
Did you hear that?
It's nothing. Just an old plane.
We might have a problem.
Die, fucker!
Why won't you die?
Fuck you!
[in Finnish] To your positions.
[in Finnish] Hello.
Where did you get that tank?
From the Nazis.
Where are the Nazis?
Except this asshole, they're all in hell.
Hell?
Were there others?
Everyone else is dead.
[in Finnish] Bills.
[man] He's breathing, he's breathing.
Multiple gunshot wounds.
Airway's secured.
[doctor, in Arabic] We've done everything we can.
It would be wise to consider a threshold.
[Yaz, in French] Sis… it's not fair to leave him like this.
[Nik] I'm not giving up on him.
[in English] What was that?
-Fuck off. -[chuckles]
And we're going to hold for five.
-[grunting] -Four, three, two…
Keep it slow.
Just go home, would ya?
Or what? You'll run over my foot?
That's about all I could do.
Thanks, Nik. For keeping me around.
Really excited about this next chapter of my life.
Believe it or not,
it's pretty difficult to let someone you care about die.
But you fought your way back.
You just have to find out why.
[man] Zurab.
[in Georgian] I just heard from the prison.
They're extending your brother's prison sentence by ten years.
[Zurab] Governor.
Zurab. Always wonderful to see you.
How are you, my friend?
I've been better.
One of our prize bulls is sick.
We have to kill him. Bury him before he infects the others.
You asked me here to commiserate?
Walk with me, would you?
You said it was urgent.
I just heard that this morning you signed off on extending my brother's prison sentence by ten years.
extending my brother's prison sentence by ten years.
Your brother threw a DEA agent off a roof.
The Americans are all over us.
When Davit and I were young,
I was to protect my brother at all costs.
My father would never let me forget it.
I contested his extradition to the States.
Kept him in a Georgian prison.
I even allowed his family to be housed in prison with him.
Let's not forget who put you in this office. And why.
I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.
One of our prize bulls is sick.
I told you.
My man! Looking good. Look at this.
What's with the shirt? You lose a bet or something?
-Don't you like it? -No.
I'll get you one. What's your size, 44 regular?
I mean, you're little bit slimmer, no?
Shut up.
I missed you, too.
He wanted to pull the plug.
Nah, that's not true. She lies.
You would have been doing me a favor.
Next time. You have my word.
[scoffs] It's funny, your sister said the same thing.
What the hell's this?
[Nik] A gift.
You're welcome.
You bring my chickens?
[Nik] We ate them.
-What about my dog? -[Yaz] Oh, we ate her, too.
Jesus, Yaz.
[Yaz] I'm joking. She's in the house.
-What am I supposed to do now? -Anything you want.
I mean, you could go on hikes, learn to knit.
You know, try to reach mindfulness.
You're gonna like it here.
All right, brother. I'll send you that shirt.
What's this?
We packed up your house. This is all we found.
Your entire life fits in one little box.
Maybe it's time to change that.
When am I going to see you again?
When we have something to celebrate.
Enjoy retirement!
Yeah, piss off.
-[whining] -Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
I wouldn't let 'em eat you, mate.
[in English] Fucking right.
[Ketevan] Don't wake them. It's hard for them to fall asleep in here.
Come.
No.
No?
Not tonight.
It's been weeks since they've seen the sun.
They can't survive like this. It's hard on them.
Hard?
He needs to grow up hard.
There are other places to hide.
Sure, in here your brother protects us.
But I don't want my son to become a Nagazi.
The last thing I need is your fat mouth.
What are you going to do?
Drag me into your cell?
You forgetting you're my wife?
Not your property.
Maybe I raise them on my own, huh?
You would not be missed.
Mom, you okay?
I thought you were sleeping.
-Are you sure you are okay? -I'm fine.
I'm sorry.
It's okay, my love.
Don't worry. It'll be okay.
Maybe Dad is right.
I do need to grow up hard.
So I can become a Nagazi.
This is beautiful, honestly, but the tea?
Not so much.
You're out of milk, by the way.
You lost, mate?
Are you Rake?
I asked you first.
Yeah, but my answer depends on yours.
See, if you are Rake, then you are the myth of Mumbai.
The legend that got the journalist out of Congo,
that took down the two gangs to save the mayor of Rio.
The honor would be all mine.
But I have to say, mate, you're not living up to the hype.
What happened? You fall off a bridge?
How about you put my cup down, hop in your car, and fuck off?
That's not very nice, is it?
Not when we've got a mutual friend who's offered you a job.
I don't have any friends.
Yeah, well, this particular individual seems to think
you're the only one that can do it.
Me? I'm not so convinced. Can you even pull the trigger like that?
Now that's why you haven't got any friends.
Why don't you go back and tell whoever sent you that I'm not interested.
Yeah?
What if it was your ex-wife? Mia.
Is that dog wearing a Valentino shirt?
[Tyler] Yeah. A friend gave it to me.
So, Mia in trouble?
No. But her sister is.
What's she caught up in?
Well, she's currently in a Georgian prison with her two kids.
Her husband's locked her in there. Can you imagine that?
-His name's, uh, Davit-- -Davit Radiani. I remember him.
Probably the last time you saw him,
he and his brother Zurab were pushing dime bags on the streets of Georgia.
But eight years later, they've built quite an empire.
Call themselves the Nagazi.
It means shepherd, apparently.
The brothers were born into war.
Raised in it. Hardened by it.
When they were kids, they fled the civil war in Georgia,
with only their lives
and escaped to Armenia.
Their uncle, Avtandil, took them in.
To this day, he runs operations for them.
But in Armenia, they faced a new kind of war.
To survive the streets of Yerevan, they turned to a life of crime.
Started running drugs in their teens, graduated to murder for hire.
They believed they were soldiers, chosen by God.
By the time they returned to Georgia,
they were folk heroes.
They offered their recruits a very powerful thing… family.
And so the brothers gained a cult-like loyalty.
And with that, they basically built themselves
a billion-dollar heroin and weapons operation.
These brothers have got all the politicians in their pockets.
They practically run the country.
If it wasn't for the Americans, Davit would be free.
Location?
They're in the Tkachiri Prison.
Now listen to me, pal, and listen to me really good.
In my expert opinion, the problem isn't Davit or the guards,
it's the two warring gangs that are imprisoned in there,
one of which would just wanna kill her, but both of which'll wanna kill you.
Now, if I were you, which I'm obviously not,
I'd want to get in there nice and quiet, keep my head down,
because the moment Davit finds out that his family's been taken,
you can rest assured that his brother is gonna wanna throw everything at you,
and I'm talking about the whole Nagazi army.
Sounds fun.
Job starts in six weeks. We take our cut,
and for, uh, political considerations, you're on your own.
If all goes well, you don't get caught or shot in the face,
I'll meet you on the other side and give you a kiss.
Failing that? It's been a pleasure.
[Nik, in French] We can get a shipment of weapons to Seoul by tomorrow night.
And my brother Yaz will fly there to deliver it personally.
[exclaims softly] I have tickets to the game tomorrow.
Sorry, I have to call you back.
Tyler.
[in English] Yeah, hey, Nik. So listen,
the whole retirement thing is not gonna work out.
Job came in.
You were clinically dead nine months ago.
Yeah, well, I'm not now. Money should be in your account pretty soon.
What are you talking about? Why did they come to you?
Haven't you heard, Nik? I'm a bit of a legend now.
I think being in a coma must have messed with your memory.
I tell you what the job is and when and how you do it.
Yeah, you also told me to find the reason I fought my way back.
Let's find out.
[in French] You're gonna miss the game.
Fucking hell.
[Nik, on radio] One minute to target.
[Yaz] You know, my hands are super sweaty lately.
I don't like it. Probably, have low blood sugar.
How do you know that?
-Saw it on TikTok. -You need to get off medical TikTok.
-[in French] You're already edgy. -I need to talk.
[in English] Every time I talk, the phone hears me, and I get more medical TikToks.
Then you should delete TikTok.
Well, that's a terrible idea.
-[in French] Are you ready? -Let's go.
[Nik, in English] All teams, eyes on. Looking good.
[guard 1, in Georgian] Freezing out there.
They don't want to sleep in the cold, they shouldn't kill people for a living.
[Nik, in English] Phoenix is at Alpha. Teams two and three standing by.
[in Georgian] 207 unlocked. You got five minutes.
[guard 1, on radio] Power is out everywhere.
[guard 2] Going to check it out.
[in English] Hey.
[in Georgian] Sandro, wake up. We have to go. Get dressed.
Who is this man?
He's going to take us out of here.
Put your shoes on.
Where are we going?
I'll tell you later.
Dad?
[in English] Shh! Keep him quiet.
[in Georgian] He's getting us out of here. Your father's waiting outside.
[Tyler, in English] Stay close.
Go.
-Package in hand. On the move. -[Nik] Copy.
Sorry, kid.
Move.
[guard, in Georgian] Code Red. Security, lock down the exits.
Security breach. All guards, Code Red.
Alert, perimeter breached. Close down the exits.
You'll have to get off your asses. It's getting busy.
[Yaz] Roger. We're ready.
Fuck! Back, back! Back! In there! Move!
Don't push me.
You're scaring him.
Yeah, well, he's about to be terrified.
[guard, in Georgian] Alert, perimeter breached. Close down the exits.
[in English] Stand back.
Stay back.
Fuck off.
Back off!
Go, go, go, go!
Yaz, I need a way out.
[Yaz] Working on it.
Which way, Yaz? I need some help.
[Yaz] Forget Bravo. Too hot. Go left. To the coal chutes, coal chutes.
Roger. Moving.
-Which way? I'm guessing up? -[Yaz] Yep. ETA two minutes.
[in Georgian] Don't be afraid. Go up, and I'll come up too.
[in English] Let's go.
Okay.
[in Georgian] Where are you taking my children? Motherfucker!
You bitch.
Tyler. We've gotta go now.
Take the kids, meet me at Charlie!
-What happened down there? -Trouble.
Come on, let's go.
-Where's my father? -[Yaz] Come on.
-[Nik] We gotta go, hold her. -Where's my father?
All teams move to Charlie. Now! Now!
[guard, over radio, in Georgian] Alert, riot in the square. Lock down the exits.
Alert, riot in the square. Lock down the exits.
Alert, all units to the prison courtyard. Close down all the exits.
Code Red. Security, lock down the exits.
Any route to Charlie that isn't through the common yard?
[Yaz] Negative, negative.
-Shit. -Not through it. There must be another way.
Stay close to me. Keep swinging that thing.
[guard, in Georgian] Close all gates. Guards, get to the walls.
[Tyler] Go!
Back off! Move! Back! Back! Back!
Rake! Help me!
-Rake! -[yelling]
Rake!
Pull the pin!
-[screams] -Hey!
[Ketevan] Help me!
No!
Help me!
[Ketevan] Tyler!
Help me!
You all right?
We're at Charlie. Open up.
[Nik] Stand clear. Breaching in three, two, one…
[Yaz] What took you so long?
-Word's out. We got to move. -The word's been out for a while.
We intercepted Nagazi radio calls. They're coming at us heavily armed.
And they know their boss is dead.
-Does the brother know? -We're about to find out.
Where are the kids?
In the car. Move. Go.
Hold on.
All right, everyone okay? Kids, you good?
[in Georgian] Where's Father? You told me he was coming.
[Ketevan] He'll meet us later.
[in English] All right, put those on. Get on the floor.
[Tyler, in English] Shit.
Eyes up. Threat coming from the front.
-[Yaz] Roger. -[Ketevan] Those are Zurab's men.
[Nik] Team three, move up. Tyler, we got your six.
Got it. Nik, get rid of these guys.
[Nik] Already on it.
One threat down. One threat down.
Okay, we just pushed the last two of them down. Drive, drive, drive.
[Tyler] Maintain formation.
-[Nik] Copy. -[Yaz] Copy.
[Tyler] Contact front, turn right, turn right.
Son of a bitch.
[Yaz] Shit. We got multiple bikes, and then an armed UTV, military-grade.
[Tyler] Stack up. Don't let them between us.
[Ketevan] Nagazi are here. Soldiers. These men are killers.
Yeah, so am I.
[Yaz] We're hit!
[Nik] Eagle's down.
Keep those bikes off me.
-They must know about Davit. -Yeah, feels that way.
[in Georgian] What do they know?
[in English] Second bike down.
-Why are Uncle's men shooting at us? -Are you okay?
[Tyler] Nik, you got the last two bikes.
Keep them on your tail. I'm coming in quick.
[Nik] Hurry!
[Tyler] That fast enough?
[Nik] Is that supposed to be funny?
UTV on our left.
[Yaz] Approaching exfil, straight ahead.
Hang on tight!
[in Georgian] Don't they know we're in this car?
[Tyler] Bravo team, we're two mikes out--
-[Yaz] Shit! -[guns firing]
Fuck!
-[Tyler] Look out, come on. Come on. -[Nik] Go, move.
[Yaz] Reloading!
Okay, I've got you. [speaks Georgian]
-The girl's hurt! We gotta move. -[Nik] Okay.
Push right through that door. On foot. Sixty seconds out.
[Yaz] Take a left!
[Nik] Right! Go right! Follow me.
[Yaz] Come on, guys. Keep it tight.
[Nik] Team four! We're on foot. Twenty seconds out.
-[Nik] Yaz, slow them down. -[Yaz] All right.
[Nik] Friendly coming through.
Yaz, get us a med kit.
[Yaz] All right. Got it.
[in Georgian] It hurts!
How bad is it?
[in English] Open fracture. She needs a doctor.
[man, on radio] Heads up, got gunships en route.
Heading to the engine.
-Yaz, need you to take over. -Okay, got it.
[Tyler] Got one helo, one's still there.
[Nik, on radio] Copy.
[man 1, in Georgian] Reaper Team, in position.
Move, move.
Reaper 1 and 2, you have to stop this train.
[man 2] Copy, moving toward the engine.
Go, go!
[man 2] Reaper 1 is down.
Breaching!
Nik, you good?
Nik?
You okay?
Better than him.
Shit, get down!
Cover me.
We're reaching the end of the line. Stop the train, Nik.
Brakes are out.
You're kidding me.
Yaz, secure the family. We got no brakes.
-We're almost there. -[Nik] Hold on.
My team's waiting for us at the end of the line.
Gonna be a rough landing, hold on tight.
-[in Georgian] What's going on? -[in English] Figure it out later.
[in Georgian] I'm sorry.
[man] This was deeply resourced.
Lead operative was A-plus.
There's maybe four or five guys who could've done this to us.
Was this the Chechens?
It's not their style.
They don't organize like this.
Someone wanted revenge.
With your brother, that's no short list.
No.
This wasn't revenge.
This was something else.
It's all right.
-Careful with her arm. -Got it.
[in Georgian] Where's Father?
There isn't time for this. Your sister needs help.
I'm not leaving without him.
-Come on. Your sister needs help. -I'm not going.
Your father isn't coming.
Is he dead?
[in English] Did you kill him?
Did you kill him?
[in Georgian] Please, Sandro.
[voice breaking] Oh, Sandro.
-Listen to me! Hey, hey! -Fuck you!
Listen to me! He was gonna kill your mother. Okay?
It was him or her.
Sandro.
[Zurab, in Georgian] Davit!
-I tried to protect him. -[Zurab's father] Is this protection?
You fight for your brother till your last drop of blood.
[Yaz, in German] Full medical detail.
I need you to meet us at Donau-City Strasse.
[in English] We touch down in 45 minutes in Vienna.
Thank you.
We're almost there.
You all right? Need anything?
I'm hungry.
Let me see what we got.
[in English] Don't. She could aspirate.
I know how to take care of my child. [in Georgian] Calm down. She's just trying to help.
[in Georgian] Calm down. She's just trying to help.
Don't patronize me.
A doctor will be there when we land. Try to rest.
[in English] Since when do you speak Georgian?
Since always.
[Ketevan] She doesn't know?
He was married to my sister.
Thanks for the heads-up.
I was going to tell you when we landed.
[in Georgian] You are a brave girl.
She's mad at you.
It's not unusual.
I should have stayed behind.
My children would be safer with me dead.
Hey, come on. You know that's not true.
We're almost there. You're almost free.
I'm gonna get you some place safe. I promise.
Thank you, Tyler.
[in Georgian] I'm listening.
Uncle… It's me, Sandro.
Sandro? Where are you?
Was my father going to kill my mother?
Sandro--
Answer me!
Don't listen to anything your mother says, you understand me?
She did this.
She had your father killed. Understand?
She has wanted to take you away from your father for years.
And now you are with the man who killed him.
So where are you?
You're a Nagazi. Be your father's son.
Where are you heading?
Where are you heading?
[in English] Remember when I first met you in Brussels?
Mia was working for Parliament.
Yeah, you had your boy with you.
I was 19.
He was just a baby. So was I.
Listen, I know what your sister must think of me.
There's nothing I can do to fix that. I just want you to know that--
It's the most awful thing a parent can endure,
watching a child die.
[mouthing in English] Thank you.
[Yaz] Okay, let's hustle. I need them on a plane in six hours.
Multiple visas.
That's nice.
[Nik] You should get some rest.
Papers are in motion.
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm sorry--
I don't need your apology. I need your trust.
I wouldn't have said no to this.
If it was important to you.
It is.
Thank you, doctor.
I can't imagine what it must have taken
to raise good kids surrounded by those men.
But you survived.
You kept your kids from harm.
Found a way with nothing. Alone.
I know what it feels like. I've been there.
Everyone deserves a second chance.
You think what you do is good?
You think you saved me?
That you're some hero?
Doesn't really matter what I think. People pay me to do things they can't.
Like killing my father.
My mother hired you to kill him. Didn't she?
No, what your mother did was risk everything to protect you and your sister.
Save you from that prison that your father put you in.
He didn't want to. They'd have killed us on the outside.
-Who? -The enemies of the Nagazi.
They'd have come for us and killed us.
He brought us there, so he could watch over us.
-He brought you there to control you. -No. He just didn't trust my mother.
Wake up, kid.
He knew she would take you and your sister
and give you a life outside of all that, not stay trapped with him.
A good son is supposed to stay with his father.
-A good father wouldn't make him. -At least my father didn't leave us.
[Zurab, in Georgian] It's the most important thing I'll ever ask you to do.
To rectify this desecration.
This filth came to our home and murdered our family.
Our brothers.
By God's law, he must die by our hand.
You are my brothers. My life is yours.
I'll follow you to the end.
My life is yours.
And mine.
You're throwing their lives away.
This path doesn't end well.
"You fight for your brother till your last drop of blood."
I haven't forgotten my father's lesson.
Have you?
[in English] You and my son met once before.
Played on the beach together. I don't know if you remember.
He'd nearly be as old as you are now.
Last time I saw him,
he was sitting in a hospital bed and drawing.
He had papers and crayons spread out everywhere.
He used to love to draw.
I came to say goodbye 'cause I was shipping out to Afghanistan,
and I knew I might not see him again, he might not be alive when I got back.
So I came to the hospital, and there he was on the bed, drawing.
And you're right, I…
And I left.
Last thing my kid remembers is me walking out on him.
But your mom, she stayed.
She stayed with your father for years to keep you safe.
Even after all the things he did to her, what you did and didn't see.
She stayed to keep you and your sister safe.
I'm not gonna lie to you, mate, shit's gonna get harder,
but you'll have to take care of her. She's gonna need you.
So you can be there for her like she was for you.
Or let your father's lies consume you.
It's on you, mate.
[voice breaking] He wasn't always like this.
I'm sorry.
-Nah, it's okay. -No.
He's coming.
Oh, kid, what did you do?
Attack team from north side. Move!
Pack it up. Let's go.
-We gotta move. -What's going on?
They found us.
Take the elevator down. Walk calmly out the front door.
I'll get to the garage, use the armored cars to punch through.
-Let's go. -[gun cocks]
[in Georgian] Up or down?
They'll come down. More options.
The children?
MEET ME IN THE BACK ALLEY.
-What did you do? -I'm sorry, Mama…
Sandro… What did you do? How could you?!
He doesn't care about you!
He's gonna kill us!
The Nagazi are my family.
[voice breaking] I am your family. Nina is your family!
-[in English] Get down! -[Nik] Get down!
Come on.
[Tyler] Chopper on the roof. They're pinching us in.
Let's go! Come on. Move. Move.
-We'll punch a hole. Break you through. -Thank you.
[Tyler] Go. Get in the car.
Sandro!
-Sandro! Kid, wait! -I got him.
Yaz! No!
Shit.
-He's going to his uncle. -Nik, stay in radio contact.
[in German] We need backup!
-Keep going, Nik. Get the boy. -Tyler…
Heads down.
Hey! Come here!
Hey!
Come back here.
Sandro.
[Yaz] Come on, kid. Come back.
Hey, kid, trust me. You don't want to do that.
[in Georgian] Come, boy.
[in English] Come back to your mother.
[in Georgian] Don't listen to him.
[Yaz] Your mother did all this to protect you. Come back.
[in Georgian] Come back to us.
Sandro.
Come to your family.
Shit!
[Yaz] Nik!
-[gunshots] -Nik, are you all right?
[in Georgian] It wasn't my mother's fault.
She just wanted us to get out of there.
Get in the car. Stay here.
Watch the boy.
[in English] Go!
Frag out.
-You all right? -[breathing heavily]
Tyler, he's got the kid. Nik and I are on foot.
Heading streetside. We need evac.
[Tyler] Hold on.
[in Georgian] Team three, take them out. Quick.
They're up top.
Force them back into the building.
[in English] Tyler, we're pinned down! Hurry up!
[Tyler, on radio] Coming to you.
[Zurab, in Georgian] Pin him in!
[in English] Stay here.
[in German] Do we have permission to engage? Shooters on the roof.
[officer, on radio] Cleared to engage.
[man, in Georgian] Police!
-Nik! Get to the roof. Take their wings. -Copy.
-[in English] Ready? Move! -[Nik] Go!
Reload!
[in English] Stay with me.
[in English] Tyler, we're at the elevator. Coming to the roof.
Move!
[in English] We're heading up now. We're right behind you.
[Yaz] Copy.
[Tyler] They're squeezing us in. Secure the chopper.
I'll sweep up from the floor below. Split their focus.
We'll clear out, and all get matching shirts. Cool?
And wear them this time.
[scoffs] Not a chance.
-Team one, they're headed to you. -We're ready.
Sergo, Konstantine, secure the entrance. Everyone else, up top.
Hey.
[in Georgian] You okay?
-[speaks Georgian] -You're gonna be okay.
[Ketevan] I am sorry.
I'm so sorry I dragged you into this.
-[in English] Hey. -[crying]
There's nothing to be sorry about.
We'll get you out of here, okay? Gonna get you back to your sister.
[in Georgian] Is he going to kill my mother?
If you wanted her alive,
you shouldn't have called.
Yaz! Need you on the 57th floor. South side.
Stay here.
Go get the family. I got this.
Go!
I'm going to enjoy killing you.
Yeah, get in line.
You must really care for this woman.
Good.
Now you know how it feels to lose someone you love.
Do you trust me?
Should I not?
Get the family.
[in Georgian] Traitor!
-[groans] -Yaz!
Yeah. Are you good?
Let's go. Let's go.
Go, go.
Got the family. Heading up.
On my way.
[Yaz] Let's go. Let's go.
[Tyler] Yaz?
Shit.
[Nik] Yaz.
Get us up, Nik! Get us up!
Tyler, what's going on?
Keep us flying, Nik. Just keep us flying.
-[Tyler] I got you. -I can't breathe.
-Sorry. Okay-- -Yaz!
Look, buddy, hey. Yaz! Yaz!
Yaz, look at me, buddy. Eyes on me.
Okay, you stay with me, buddy. I got you!
Yeah, man…
[Nik] Yaz!
[Nik sobbing] No!
[in Georgian] What happened?
-Mia! -Keto.
-Mia. -Keto.
[in Georgian] I thought I'd never see you again.
[Avtandil] The whole country is looking for us.
Then go, get on the plane.
We lost ten Nagazi today.
Good soldiers.
It's enough.
Don't be afraid.
It'll be fine.
Be an example to Sandro.
You're no good to him dead,
or rotting in an Austrian prison.
How can I be an example to Sandro,
if I run away?
Let's ask God.
"Fear not, for I'm with you."
"The Lord is near to the brokenhearted."
I know, I've read it.
I once believed God took your hearing,
so he could whisper right into your ear.
But now you only hear your rage.
You know who my father used to compare you to?
Do you remember the cricket from the movie?
The one who sits on the boy's nose.
Always chirping nonsense in his ear.
Chirping and chirping, again and again.
Do you remember it?
And where is your father now?
Where is your brother?
I always knew there was a bullet waiting for me,
but not from your gun.
Sweetheart.
You got so big.
Aunt Mia's going to take us somewhere safe. Okay?
Is Sandro coming?
[in English] Made you a coffee if you want. Milk, two sugars.
Look, if I had anyone else to ask, I would have.
Yeah, I know. It's, um… It's good.
Look, I know you don't want to hear this…
I'm sorry I wasn't there.
I'm sorry I wasn't there. I'm sorry I didn't stay. I should have…
Should have been there for you, for him.
You're right. I don't wanna hear it.
Why didn't you stay?
Why didn't you stay?
Well, they needed me in, um… in Kandahar and--
We needed you.
-Because I was deployed-- -Why didn't you stay?
-Well, I had orders, and… so I couldn't… -Bullshit.
-No, why didn't you stay? -I couldn't…
I couldn't fix it. I couldn't fucking fix it.
[Zurab] I'm standing here, staring at my plane. -But I can't get on it. -Yeah, why is that?
-But I can't get on it. -Yeah, why is that?
Because I could never live my life knowing you're still around.
Where's the boy?
You think the boy wants anything to do with you?
I think he's confused.
Why don't you tell me where you are, and we can finish what we started?
Want to negotiate?
At the airfield. By St. George's Church.
I'm not coming to negotiate.
Don't do this.
Stay with her. Get them out.
Open the door. Open the door!
Tyler!
Sergo! Sergo!
Hurry up.
[Zurab, in English] Come.
You want the boy. Here he is.
[Tyler] This is between me and you. Let him go.
[Zurab] No, he stays here.
You know, God gave me a mission to rain vengeance upon your head.
Sometimes there is a great sacrifice in enacting God's will.
He's just a kid.
Doubt me.
Pull the trigger, consume yourself in a lifetime of guilt.
Life is slowly draining from your body.
I've had worse.
[in Georgian] Go. Take his gun.
Don't make me tell you again.
[in English] Give him the weapon.
Now weigh the gun in your hand, and point at his head.
You're a coward.
Coward?
Cowardice is killing an unarmed man in the bowels of a prison.
[in Georgian] I said to point the gun at him.
This is the man who killed your father.
Avenge him.
Pull the trigger.
[in English] It's okay, mate.
[in Georgian] Disappointing.
[in English] Put the gun down. Put the gun down.
Oh, you can exact retribution for your brother,
but it will be at the cost of his life right now.
So put the gun down!
[in French] I'm going to blow his asshole face off.
[Tyler, in English] Nik,
the boy.
Good girl.
Fuck you.
I'm… I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I will not…
stop.
-Hey. -Hey.
How are they?
Good. Safe.
They're in witness protection.
I helped her broker a deal with the Americans.
She gave them trade routes, bank accounts, names.
The Americans froze their assets though. Took it all.
If you go to my cabin in the third floorboard back from the fireplace,
there's a million in cash. You can give it to them.
I… I came here because I wanted--
I… I came here because I wanted-- Thank you, Mia.
I know, I never said that.
I never said "thank you" for doing what I… couldn't.
His last image of you wasn't you walking out on him.
It was you going off to save people.
And he was so brave, Tyler, when it ended.
He said, "I want to be brave like Dad."
That's how he saw you.
Goodbye, Tyler.
[man] It's like the goddamn Sound of Music out here. Isn't it?
Told you not to get caught.
Shit happens, eh?
What if I could get you out?
How does that work?
Come and do another job for us.
Not without my team. I'm not leaving her behind.
Yeah. Thought you might say that.
[man] Rake.
Rake. That's such a fun name to say.
You never told me your name. Is it as much fun?
My name doesn't matter.
Yeah? What does?
Who I work for.
Who's that?
[male voice on phone] Callum.
[male voice] I want you to meet me in 15 minutes.
[Callum] What? Tonight? Now?
-At this location. -[phone chimes]
Uh, no, I… I don't think I can make that in time.
[man chuckles] Fine.
I mean, I'm happy to text your girlfriend the screenshots if you like,
or, uh, or your mum.
No, don't. [breathing shakily] Please don't tell my mum.
Well, then, be here in 15 minutes,
or everyone in your contact list will get the screenshots.
[Callum] Shit. Not now. No.
-Emergency. What service do you require? -Yeah, uh, hello?
-Fire, police or ambulance? -Uh, ambulance, please. Um…
Uh, maybe police. There's been a crash.
Uh…
No, there's someone in the road.
[Callum] A man. Uh, maybe someone in the car.
[Callum] I think they're, um…
Okay.
Yeah. Yeah. I… I can check.
Uh, the man in the road is, um…
No. No, I don't think he is.
Okay. Just stay on the line.
Just don't leave me alone.
-[Callum] Shit. -[suspenseful music playing]
No, the passenger… looks really bad.
[panting] No, it looks like they've…
Shit.
-[Luther] Morning. -There you go.
Cerys Jones, city banker, high achiever,
disappeared seven years ago.
Suspected suicide.
[Luther] So where's she been?
[Schenk] Well, from what we can tell, on ice.
What, for seven years?
[Schenk] Well, we won't know for how long until we can run proper tests.
And the car?
Reported stolen. South London, ten days ago.
What about the lad that called it in? What's his name? Um…
Aldrich?
[Schenk] Callum.
What was he doing here?
[Schenk] Yeah, well, that's the question.
He left work to drive here
for no reason that we've been able to establish.
Saw the site, called 999, and then evaporated.
This isn't a case of wrong place at the wrong time, is it?
Someone wanted him here.
[officer] Sorry. We can't let you through.
I have to. I've been waiting too long.
Who's that?
[Schenk] It's the mother. Corinne.
Corinne, hi. I'm DCI Luther.
I'm in charge of finding your son.
Where is he?
[Luther] Well, we don't know. Not yet.
This scene is… It's… it's unusual.
My son is out there somewhere right now. So you need to find him.
-[Luther] I'll do the very best I can. -[Corinne] It's not good enough.
I need you to promise me.
I need you to promise me you'll find Callum.
Okay.
I promise.
I'll bring your boy home. Okay?
Now, try not to worry too much.
[male voice] No, no, no relax. This isn't about you and your predilections.
There's this chap, Detective Chief Inspector Luther.
And he's in charge of finding this poor young lad Callum,
and I can't allow that to happen, I'm afraid.
Now, listen, listen.
From what I hear, DCI Luther's a bit of a bad apple.
Trouble is, he's a very analog bad apple.
Doesn't have what you might call an online presence,
which is why I'm calling you.
I want everything on him.
Every furtive little secret,
every intimate disgrace.
I want his corruption.
I want evidence of any misstep.
Any wrongdoing.
Any line he's crossed.
I want… his shame.
Extraordinary scenes today outside London's Old Bailey,
where following the release to the media of an apparently incriminating dossier,
DCI John Luther,
a storied police officer, is appearing in a multitude
of serious criminal charges.
[reporter 2] And yet he now stands charged with a shocking catalog of crimes
including breaking and entering, suspect intimidation,
tampering with evidence, bribery.
A litany of alleged vigilante activity that critics say attest to a man
who felt entitled to take justice into his own hands…
Detective Chief Inspector John Luther was in charge of the hunt
for missing London teenager Callum Aldrich
at the time of his arrest.
Since when, London police have been heavily criticized
for the lack of progress in this case.
DCI Luther had recently apprehended husband and wife serial killers
Jeremy and Vivian Lake,
whilst leading the hunt for the missing teenager Callum Aldrich.
…for the metropolitan police commented that the search for Callum Aldrich
remains their highest priority.
Good luck with that, now, mate.
[reporter 2] …we expect to see Luther being driven out through the gates of the Old Bailey
to begin a lengthy sentence at Hawksmoor maximum security prison.
[reporter 2] As a former police officer, what life will be like for him there
is anybody's guess.
Okay, then. I think we are about ready to go.
[man 2] Stand up if you hate police! [men chanting] Stand up if you hate police! -Stand up if you hate police! -[door unlocking]
[men] Stand up if you hate police! Hurry up.
[chanting] Stand up if you hate police! Stand up if you hate police!
-Stand up if you hate police! -[metal clanging] Come on, let's go.
Out of the way. Come on. Move! Move!
Come on. -[inmate 1] Fuck you, copper. -Move. Get out of the way!
-[inmate 1] Fuck you, copper. -Move. Get out of the way!
Back up! -[banging continues] -[officer] Come on.
-[inmate 2] Watch your back, copper. -Fuck off.
-[inmates jeering, laughing] -[guard] Come on. Let's get moving.
Hello.
[boy] Mum?
Who is this?
-Mum, can you come and get me? -Who is this?
Mum, it's me.
Callum? Is it really you? Callum?
Callum?
[voicemail] Hey, it's Callum. Sorry I missed your call.
Uh, leave me a message at the sound of the beep.
[echoing] Hello?
Callum?
Callum, it's me. It's Mum.
[voicemail] Hey, it's Callum. Sorry I missed your call.
Callum.
[voicemail] Hey, it's Callum…
DCI Raine. Yep. Okay.
[news anchor] Our reporter, John Cunningham, is at the scene.
[Cunningham] Details are sketchy at this stage.
The scene is tightly cordoned off, but there are unconfirmed reports
that a number of bodies have been found in the house.
We're awaiting confirmation that one of the bodies
is that of the missing teenager Callum Aldrich.
The police are yet to issue any official information.
[Raine] Eight victims.
Each officially a missing person until last night.
The house belongs to a Saudi national
who hasn't set foot on British soil in five years.
Our killer must've known that. Let's find out how.
Earliest crime goes back 11 years.
The most recent dates back to last year.
So, where were the bodies stored in the interim?
And who would have the kind of space, time, or money
to do something like that?
This has been carefully planned and executed over a number of years,
so there'll be a lot of data to parse.
But… you find me one point of commonality between these victims, just one,
-and you'll have our killer. -[detective] Yes, ma'am.
Let's get to it.
Find me that connection.
[softly] Shit.
Mum!
Mum! Ah! Ah! Please stop!
[laughing] Hello again, John.
Do you know who that was? Oh, I'll bet you do.
Oh, poor Callum.
[chuckling] You know, I had him.
Yeah, I had him tucked away,
and I stood next to you at a bus stop.
Offered you a mint, and you took it.
I looked you right in the eye 'cause I was curious.
I wanted to know if you'd see it in me.
Because that is who you are, isn't it?
The man who knows all about people like me.
But you didn't see me.
And now you are in a cage because I put you there.
It makes me wonder how you're gonna feel, having to watch what happens next.
You all right?
Tickety-boo.
[guard] Someone's here to see you.
Who?
Barbra Streisand. Fuck do I know?
[Luther] Corinne?
Well, you remembered my name at least.
[Luther] Of course I remember your name.
Corinne, what are you doing here?
Corinne, I'm so…
Do you know what they did to him?
No.
Can you talk me through it?
Why?
So you can help?
Well, you already promised me that once.
You looked me in the eye and promised me.
But it seems you were busy with more important things.
I hope someone tells you what they did to my son.
I hope you never sleep again.
Corinne. Corinne, wait. Wait, wait. Corinne.
Liar.
Thank you so much for doing this.
I never could have driven myself.
Honestly, no worries. I…
Anything that you need.
Anything. You just… You just have to ask.
[reporter] Police are yet to reveal any official information,
although we have been informed that there are multiple fatalities,
which occurred in a fire shortly before midnight.
We are awaiting further information from the authorities
surrounding the circumstances.
[Raine] So, no neighbors. Plenty of space…
Excuse me, ma'am. There's a call for you. He says it's urgent.
Thank you.
DCI Raine.
DCI Raine, it's, uh, DCI John Luther…
Well, I mean, it's not…
I, um, was a DCI in your department.
Of course. I've heard of you.
-How did you get this call out to me? -Callum Aldrich. That was my case.
[Raine] I'm aware of that. Yes.
[Luther] The killer contacted me and sent me
a recording of Callum's death. Now, he also sent me a personal message.
Now, he also sent me a personal message.
Okay, I'm… I'm sorry.
I can't imagine how that must feel, but truthfully,
he has contacted everyone.
He did what?
He sent recordings of the murders
to all eight families.
So why… why does he make an announcement?
Why does he make an announcement right now?
I'll tell you why. Because something's coming.
And whatever it is, he needs… he needs an audience.
That's the kind of personality he is. He needs an audience.
-Read the room, John. Stop. -He wants us to see it.
Get ahead of him, get ahead of him and stop worrying about where he's come from,
but where he's about to go next.
-I said enough! Enough. -[sighs] Jesus.
Do you think I give a shit about a dirty copper's unfinished business?
Do you think I need advice from you?
You can't help me, John,
and God knows you can't help Callum Aldrich.
It is still my case.
No, it's not. It's mine.
You abdicated yourself of that privilege when you did what you did.
And… and you know, honestly, I'm glad.
I am glad that you're ashamed.
I'm glad that it hurts to be where you are because… because it should.
Now, do not call this office again.
If you do one call and I will have you slammed up in solitary
for the duration. Clear?
Well done, Raine. I'm still a copper.
[Raine] Ah no. No, you're not.
Not anymore.
Put a call in to the prison governor. Get that phone taken off him. Thank you.
[man] To be honest, I don't know why you bothered calling.
It's not even my area of expertise.
I'm basically a thief.
I'm not asking you to fucking marry me.
I'm asking you to do me a job.
It's not the job I've a problem with. It's who I'd be doing it for.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Look, I didn't trust you when you were the right side of the law.
Why would I now?
Dennis, you been watching the news?
The Bishops Avenue thing. Have you seen that?
Have you seen what that prick has done?
Yeah, yeah, I saw that.
So, you can… you can see why I've got to get the fuck out of here.
You're having a laugh.
I know what happened to you and to your mum.
And I know that you were eight years old.
That's why I'm calling you, you of all people,
because you hate pricks like this.
And so do I.
So what are you asking?
Stand still!
[Luther] Me being in here…
I know it makes your life very difficult.
Make me someone else's problem.
Get me transferred out tonight.
We can't make that happen by magic. There are systems in place.
I know what systems are in place, which is why you've gotta let 'em have what they want.
Let them come at me,
so big, so loud, that the system has to kick in,
has to transfer me.
-Let them at you? -Yeah.
How does that make sense?
Because I'm ready.
Can you do it or not?
I mean, in theory, yeah, but…
If it goes wrong, spins out of control, you're a dead man. They'll kill you, John.
All right, yeah. I… I can live with that.
So let 'em come.
Let them come.
Shit.
Look. Shit.
[guard 2] Now! All available staff!
[man yelling] Don't fucking move! Don't fucking move!
[man 2] Get on the fucking ground.
-[man] Open the fucking door! -[groans]
-Come here! Move it! Open the door now! -[gun cocking]
[man] Keep your hands still!
Come on! On your feet! Move it! Move it! Move it!
Move!
-Boo. -[relieved sigh]
I can't stay long.
I just wanted to pop by
and show you something.
[in Portuguese] Something was troubling her. She wouldn't tell us what.
But she was scared of someone.
[in English] Who is she afraid of, do you think?
Poor little Brigida.
[reporter] …the worrying spike in unexplained disappearances of young adults…
Oh, darling, no. No. Please open… -Open your eyes. -Mm.
[reporter] …surrounding Brigida's disappearance have similarities
to those of missing French student Camille Fontaine
and Croatian teenager, Jacov…
You know…
You always said…
that I should talk to somebody about this. Mmm…
And so that's exactly what I'm doing…
because…
[singing] ♪ I'm coming out ♪

[Dennis] Christ on a scooter.
These the wheels you bought from Fat Thommo Chitwood that time?
[Luther] Yeah. Five hundred quid and a bootleg David Bowie album.
Blue vinyl. Never let me down though.
[Dennis] Never will.
If you look after it,
which you haven't.
[Luther] Yeah, well.
Cheers, Den.
I got you that thing you asked for.
Perfect.
Listen, Luther.
When you take this prick to the ground,
you do him grievous on my behalf, yeah?
You do him damage.
You take care, John.
Yeah.
DCI Raine.
When?
Okay.
Okay, thank you.
Boss? What's up?
Luther's out.
Luther's what?
Out.
Detective Superintendent Schenk.
Just Martin. I'm retired.
Well, they retired me.
DCI Raine.
My replacement.
So how are things at the shop?
Busy. Do you mind if I sit?
I presume you've come for background in the Aldrich case.
But for that you're…
I know who I have to go to, which is basically my problem.
Look, I know he's in prison, but if all you need is background,
I don't see an ethical conundrum.
Except he's not in prison.
But… Oh.
Of course he's not.
Listen. He's your friend?
-He is. -You know him better than anyone.
You know how he thinks.
If John really is your friend, you'll find him,
stop him nosing at my investigation.
But if John Luther shows his face and refuses an order to stand down,
which we both know he will,
Tactical Unit will shoot him dead.
So…
Martin…
I'm not asking you to catch him for me.
We can do that.
I'm asking you to save his life.
[sobbing] Mum!
Mum! Ah! Ah! Please stop!
[male voice chuckling] Hello again, John.
Do you know who that was?
Oh, I bet you do.
Poor Callum.
The killer got to him using an FM broadcast. 65.8 FM.
Trace the frequency to source and you'll find John.
Out-fucking-standing. Thank you, Martin.
Bring him in.
Martin, what are you doing the rest of the day?
Morning.
-I'm sorry. We're not open yet. -I'm police.
Can I see your badge?
I forgot it in my other coat.
Sorry about that.
What's your name?
Derek.
Derek. Do you know who I am, Derek?
I don't think so, no.
You really don't know who I am, do you?
I really don't, no.
So how come you're broadcasting the recording of a murder to me?
Wait! No! Wait!
-[Derek whimpers] -[Luther] You fucking…
Sit down! And I want you to do me a favor.
Sit there and do nothing silly. Understand?
Yes.
[Raine on radio] Archie, we've tracked the signal. Sending the coordinates now.
-Where is it? -In the cup…
-Where is it? -In the cupboard.
In the cupboard. Idiots.
-Have you listened to this? -[Derek] No.
-Have you? No? -No!
Good, because it's fucking horrible. You know what it is?
It's the dying breaths of a young man.
A young man named Callum Aldrich, and it's fucking horrible.
And I want to find the prick that made that recording.
And you're gonna help me by telling me how this transmitter got here.
-I can't. -No?
Okay, right, well, this is the part where I do something horrible to you
like perhaps, I don't know, tattoo your fucking eyeball.
How do you turn it on? Turn it on! Go on.
-[buzzing] -There you go. -No, please… -Don't move. Stop moving! Stop moving. Stop moving!
I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. Do you know why?
I've got this thing, and I've had it since I was a kid.
It's kind of like a instinct thing, you know,
where you kind of look at someone, and you read them.
And you can tell whether they're good or bad.
I can tell, I can tell, Derek, that you're decent.
Yeah.
So, I'm gonna ask you again. How did that transmitter get here?
It arrived by courier.
-Is that a fucking joke? -No, no, no!
I was told to leave it running for 24 hours and then ditch it.
Go on.
-That's it. -What?
Don't know if you've noticed, but your game's up!
The police are here! I'm here!
Now, come on.
-[exhales] I met a man online. -Yeah. Mm-hmm.
He was into extreme submission porn.
We exchanged fantasies for a long time, months.
Decided to move things into the real world.
His needs were very specific.
-He wanted to be taken by surprise. -Right.
He gave me his details. Name, address,
time he got home from work, the alarm code.
Speed it up. Come on. Fuck's sake.
One night, I was waiting when he came home.
There was a safe word, but he didn't use it.
So, I kept going.
I just kept going.
Because I hadn't really been talking to him.
I'd been catfished.
Set up by somebody posing as this poor man to assault him.
He had no idea who I was or why I was there. -[officer yelling faintly] -[groans]
Armed police! Get back!
And then what?
-[Derek] Blackmail. -Mm-hmm.
The catfisher had it all on film. All the things I did.
Who was that?
-I don't know. -You don't know?
No, I don't know! Just… Look… Just…
I don't know him. I've never met him. I just do what he tells me, okay?
I've got to make this right.
-I really do. -Okay.
-And it's going to be bad for you. -I know.
But it's not as bad as you think.
Not if you help me catch this man.
I can't.
Oh, you can.
[Luther] For fuck's sake. What is it?
-Hmm? -He texts me.
-Armed police! Armed police! -Armed police!
He never uses the same phone for more than a day.
You should have given me this earlier.
I know.
-Armed police! -Armed police! Go!
Armed police!
[officer 1] All clear.
[officer 2] All clear!
[in Estonian] Have we got the place ready?
It's ready!
And the last of the livestock?
En route and on schedule.
So we're ready to go?
We're ready.
Here's to the start of my new life.
I wish you could be with me at the launch party.
[man on computer] Where do you wanna meet?
[woman moaning] Oh yes. Yes, yes, right there. [moans]
-Oh my God! What are you doing? -Oh crap.
[Schenk] Schenk.
Wotcha.
I was wondering when you'd call.
[Luther] Yeah. I see you're back in the shop then.
I'm consulting, yes.
Helping them to catch you.
Great work finding me. How did you do that?
Had a sniff around your cell.
Found the radio tuned to a dead station.
I know you to be a Radio 4 man.
Yeah, well, that or the cricket. That was very good work.
Well, there's life in the old fucker yet.
Oh no, I never doubted it. Are they listening in?
Not yet.
I got him.
What do you mean you've got him?
Well, as good as. I got a number.
-How? -[scoffs]
Doesn't matter how, but the number won't be good to you lot. Not yet.
They're not my lot.
Yes, and given the fact
that it was obtained by an escaped criminal,
I doubt there'll be much of an argument for a warrant on the back of it.
Can you do me a favor?
Can you trace the number?
You know I'm not going to do that.
Come on, boss. What are they going to do? Fire you?
One more time for auld lang syne, and for what it's worth,
he uses burners. The number won't be good tomorrow.
Call me back in 15 minutes.
Hey, do you want to put 20 on it?
On what?
Twenty that I get him
before you get me.
Make it 50.
[Raine] Well, he's got some onions on him, I'll give him that.
[Schenk] Look, I know how it feels.
I've sat in the same chair, expressed the same sentiments,
but there's a double play here.
Do as he asks. Trace the phone. Give him a location.
[Raine] Luther's pulling us away from the case.
Look, the worst outcome is
he's arrested and locked up by teatime.
The best outcome?
He's right and leads you directly to your killer.
Except if I were Luther, I'd assume you and I were having this conversation.
He knows. Of course he knows. He just doesn't care.
All he wants is for this man to be caught and stopped.
We'd have to go in heavy.
The heavier the better, I should imagine.
I thought he was your friend.
He is. That doesn't mean you should trust him though.
[Luther] All right, boss. What's in the box?
-Deal or no deal? -The phone's at Piccadilly Circus.
Nice one.
[woman on radio] All units, we're searching for an IC3 male in the Piccadilly Circus area.
Do not approach the subject. Over.
Excuse me. Uh, excuse me.
I'm running late to see my wife. Mind if I make a quick call?
I lost my cell phone. I'll be two minutes.
Thank you. You are a lifesaver. Thank you so much. Right, okay, thank you.
So, where is he now?
[Schenk] Stationary for the last 20 minutes.
Still Piccadilly Circus.
[Luther] Something doesn't feel right.
What is he waiting for?
John, identify the target, but do not engage.
I love you too.
-Thank you so much. -Thank you.
All right, all right, Luther's on foot
in Soho en route to Piccadilly Circus.
Stay on him.
Go.
Okay, that's confirmed. Luther's at Piccadilly Circus.
Do we take him?
[officer 2] Bravo unit. Ready to engage.
Wait for Luther to ID a suspect,
then move in and take them both.
Received.
Who is this?
[Luther] You know who it is.
Move!
Excuse me. Hey! Oh!
-Stand back! Police! -[people yelling]
-Go, go, go, go! -That's it. Let's go.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! -[groans] Stop! Stop!
-Back. -All right, just look at me.
-Back! Back! -Whoa.
Go, go, go, go!
-[Luther] All right. -Back.
-Okay. Just relax. Stop, stop, stop! -Back.
It's over now. All right. It's over now.
Yeah? Well, why… Why would you say that?
It's just about to get started.
What's going on?
Wait for it.
-Bong. -[bell tolls]
What are you doing? Call it off.
-[dull thud] -Bong!
-[Raine] Move! -[officer] Armed police, get back!
Do you see me now?
Can you see me now?
[officer] Armed police! Stand back!
Down on the ground, now!
-Do not move. On the ground! -Armed police!
Both of you on the ground now!
All right!
-[officers shouting] -[Raine] Down on the ground!
[man] Get out of the way!
[Luther] Oi!
Sorry. Move! Move!
[Luther] Out the way! Out the way!
[on PA] The train is now ready to depart. Mind the doors, please. Mind the closing doors.
[sighs] For fuck's sake.
Possible sighting. Attempting to intercept.
[officer] Armed police! [officer] Police! Police! Do not move! Police!
[officer] Police! Police! Do not move! Police!
Come here! Come here and cuff him!
Police! Do not move!
Just fucking cuff him first, and then get me.
-[officer] Do not move! Do not! -Okay
-On your face. On your face! -All right.
Shit!
Ah! Wait!
Shit!
-All right, mate. All right, mate. -Shit.
-All right. Now, what's your name, pal? -Jamal.
Jamal? Listen to me. Look at me in the eyes.
Will you look at me? All right, calm down while I take a look at your leg.
-Armed police! Back away! -[Luther] Relax.
-Move away! -[Luther] Mate, do me a favor and listen.
You can put the cuffs on me as long as I can sort out Jamal.
Just give me a hand here, all right? Come on. Come here now.
-Freddie, Freddie! -If you got any gauze, you'll need it.
-Got some here. -I got cut, Freddie. I got cut.
-It's all right. Just relax there, pal. -Really bleeding. -[Luther] He's cut an artery. -Fucking hell.
-[Luther] He's cut an artery. -Fucking hell.
Never mind, put the whole thing in there.
-Seriously, mate. Stay still, all right? -DCI Luther.
-Yes, mate. -[Jamal] I'm sorry I hit you.
You hit me. It's all right 'cause I'm a wanted man.
Of course you can hit me.
[Jamal] Jesus!
I did a job with you back in the day.
Did ya? On what? Put pressure on that.
-Cameron Pell. -Cameron Pell?
-A school bus and all that malarkey. -Yeah?
I remember you. Yeah. You did some good work on that one.
-Really good work. You did good. -Yeah…
-Sir, you need to go now. -He's gonna fade fast… Leg it. Leg it!
-What? I can't leave you. -Go now!
Go! Go! I'm fine. I'm all right.
Look, Freddie's got this. Right, Fred?
-Yeah, yeah, I got this. Go. -[Jamal] So go.
-Freddie? -Give him a dig from me. Go.
-Just go. -[Luther] Listen, you're a good cop, okay?
[Freddie] Jamal, calm down, mate. It's all right. Help is on the way.
Off… Officer injured! Jamal. Jamal! Wake up! Fuck's sake.
Jamal. Officer injured!
I thought the fucker was in prison.
Yeah, not anymore.
How much of a problem is this gonna be?
Uh, I don't know.
-It's been a big fucking problem so far. -So…
Look after it for me.
I mean, this is a big day for me, Archie.
[Archie] What the fuck does that mean?
Just look after it, will ya?
You know what's gonna happen, don't you? Hmm?
Imagine your wife's face when she hears about what you did.
People that you work with. Hmm?
The judge.
Oh my God, your mum.
-Everything all right? -[Archie] Uh…
No. Your friend's giving me conniptions.
Ah. Yes. He'll do that.
[in Estonian] Yes?
Arkady!
I need you to go ahead and get things ready.
I'm running a few hours late.
Of course. Is there a problem?
No. No problem.
I just need to stop off and pick up one extra.
How are we looking otherwise?
The site's up and counting down.
They're coming in numbers.
Nice one.
-See you soon then. -See you soon.
Quiet, please.
Quiet!
[Schenk] John, where are you?
Do me a favor, boss. Just put her on, please.
What do you want, John?
How is he?
He died, John.
You just…
You couldn't bear not being in the center of things.
And now a good man is dead.
I hope you're proud.
Look, if you want to bring him in, you'll have to hold him on the line
while your officers get on site.
[Schenk] All right, John.
Finish what you were about to say quickly, please.
What do we know about the way he selects his victims? What do we know about that?
[Schenk] Sweet Fanny Adams. Victimology is all over the shop.
No pattern.
But there's got to be something in common. Right? Some attributes.
Yeah, well, if they do, only he can see it.
Yeah, exactly.
What do we know about the jumpers?
[Raine] None of them were vulnerable in the typical ways.
Uh, they all had jobs,
emotional and financial support structures,
and they were in the top 5% of earners.
Yeah. They were good people, weren't they?
Yes. All right. Explain.
I mean, it doesn't matter who you are.
We've all got something that you don't want anyone else to know about.
Something you're ashamed of. It could be something sexual.
Could be financial. Could be criminal.
Problem is these days people live their secret lives out on the internet.
So I think he's probably lurking, you know,
fishing for secrets,
and I bet he's not going to them. No, he's not stupid, is he?
No. He knows he'll get caught that way. So he's using…
blackmail to make them come to him.
Jesus, John.
All of them?
Yeah, no, all of them,
because I think he's probably figured out that in the right circumstances,
the fear of shame, the fear of being called out,
the fear of being caught is way more powerful than the fear of death.
There's no way to get ahead of it. How do you catch someone
There's no way to get ahead of it. How do you catch someone who can get to anyone?
He's… [sighs] He's a parasite.
He's feeding off it.
He's on Millfield Avenue SE1.
John. Sorry, are you there? We'd lost you for a…
John?
John?
Hey, Mum.
Anya Raine, have you been asleep?
[Anya] No.
Have you been in bed all day?
No.
I'm having a bit of a rough go of it at work today,
so I might not be able to drive you tomorrow.
Yeah, no worries. Okey dokey.
But you can get an Uber on my account.
Not an SUV because you are not Rihanna.
But if I don't get a chance to speak to you before then,
good luck.
I love you.
-I love you too. -Also…
If that kitchen is left in a mess, I will be very, very salty.
-Kitchen's spotless. -All right.
I love you. Bye.
[male voice whispering] Anya.
Anya.
Manda, is that you?
[male voice] Anya.
[male voice] Anya.
[Luther] Corinne, I had him.
I had him.
Look, I think he knew something, this man.
I think he knew something about Callum
I think he knew something about Callum that Callum didn't want anyone else to know.
Something like what? I don't follow.
I don't know. Um, maybe he, uh…
He stole money, or he cheated.
-He'd never do anything like that. -No, no.
But whatever it was, it was small, probably, but it mattered to Callum.
And he agreed to meet this man.
And pay him off.
Corinne, um, I know this is really difficult. Okay?
And I'm sorry for what I'm about to say.
I think you know this man.
I think… I think he's in your life.
I don't understand what that means.
It means I need to understand
if someone new has come into your life since you lost Callum.
It would be a friend.
someone that you possibly met at the support group.
You could have met him socially.
He's nice. He's warm.
He never wants anything back from you. He, he, he…
Well, there's Tommy, but it's not him.
Tommy?
What can you tell me about him?
I met him at a support group.
He lost his wife, and he lost her in terrible circumstances.
Really terrible.
He took me to the prison when I…
He can't!
That would be…
He's been in this house. He's picked up these photographs.
He's touched them.
Commiserated with me.
Please tell me he's not that cruel.
John, please.
I need to use your phone. Can I do that?
Yeah, it's in there.
[Schenk] We've been speaking to the families.
John was right.
At least five of them have been in some way
befriended by a man in his 40s.
Different names,
but the same approximate age, height, and general description.
-Any of the names check out? -No.
Not as such,
but each of these men claims to have a wife
who burned to death in a house fire in Eccleston Square.
Dates given vary from 2007 to the present day.
Good work.
Anya, sweetheart. I can't talk right now.
[Anya screaming] Mum! Mum!
Anya.
Anya.
[whimpering] Mum…
Don't you fucking touch her. I'll fucking kill you, you piece of shit.
-If you touch one hair on her head… -Shh. Shush, shush now, shush.
Do you know my name, Odette?
Yes.
Have you told anyone?
-No. -Good. Let's keep it that way, please.
Would you like your daughter back?
Fuck you. Yes.
Then I'd like you to deal with this Luther issue for me, please.
Do you think you can do that for me to get Anya back?
Because I'd like you to imagine something for me,
if you would, Odette.
I would like you to imagine…
the pain I could put you through
when I am enjoying myself with her.
[Raine] Archie's right. It's a dead end.
Odette, you're wrong.
-It's got legs. It's good. -No. It's a chimera.
Just a pattern in the noise. Listen…
You're a great help, Martin, but it hasn't worked out.
So you are free to go with our gratitude.
I will call you if we need you again.
-Odette, I… -We're done. Thank you.
[Luther] So what we got?
[Raine] You were right.
He's worked his way into their lives, befriended them.
All right.
Have we got a name?
Yeah, we got a name.
Okay. Who is he?
I'm not going to tell you that, John.
Can't have you pitching up at the arrest turning everything into a circus.
-I don't want that either. -Fine.
-I just… -I owe you.
So you agree to meet me at a place of my choosing.
I want you cuffed in the back of my car. No tricks. No games.
You can witness the arrest before I hand you in.
This is an offer, a one-time offer, and it ends in five seconds.
Can I trust you?
Think we're past that now, aren't we?
Right. Okay, yeah, fine. But I choose the place.
Evening, sir. What can I get you?
Oh, I don't know. It's been a long day. [clears throat] What do you suggest?
-I'd say a long day calls for a martini. -No.
Whiskey? We have an 18-year-old Glenmorangie, uh, Tullamore Dew.
I'll have a glass of water.
If it makes you happy, you can make it fizzy.
DCI Raine.
So who is he then?
-I'll tell you in the car. -Nah.
Fine.
Name's David Robey, city trader.
Suspected aggravated sexual assault six years ago.
Never proven.
A few months later, his wife's planning to leave him until she's injured in a fire.
Suspected arson. Never proven.
Did the wife survive?
If you want to call it that.
Where's your car?
Around the corner. Next right.
[Luther] Odette.
[Raine] Just walk to the car.
What has he got on you?
-What has he got on you? -My daughter. So…
-In. -[Luther] Raine… [Raine] In.
If you do this for him, you'll never get her back.
-You must know that. -I'll tell you what I know. I'll tell you.
I know he never would have taken her if you hadn't gotten involved.
No. He'd done it anyway as soon as you got close.
He'd use her to control you, which is what he's doing now.
-Enough. Get in the fucking car. -She's alive right now. Okay.
He will kill her as soon as it suits him.
-I said, "enough." -And you'll be alive.
-And he'll love that, so that you… -Shut up.
-Jesus Christ. Put that away. -Shut up.
-Get in the car. Get in. -Put that down.
He'll love it knowing you could never admit what you've done.
-The shame of it. Listen to me. -Shut up. Shut up.
He needs you right now, and he needs your daughter.
-[gun fires] -Jesus! Get in the fucking car now!
-Get in the car! -I'm just saying we could use that.
All right? To bring her home. You and me, we could get her back.
Odette!
Okay, so if we do this, no one can know.
Not, not Schenk, nobody, because he's got someone on the inside.
-I know he does. -How? How?
I just know. I know him, okay?
Get out.
So what now?
[nurse] She's very weak. It's very difficult for her to talk.
Thank you.
Georgette, I'm DCI Raine and this is…
I'm DCI John Luther.
I think you know what David's been doing. [Georgette] Please leave me alone, please.
Afraid we can't do that.
Archie, where's the boss?
I'm not sure. Why?
Oh shit. Um, nobody can raise her.
She's probably chasing a lead. Why?
Because Luther was right. Something's coming.
Jesus holy fucking Christ.
People on-screen match people reported missing
over the last five, six weeks all over Europe.
Where's the site hosted? Can we track it?
No.
So…
What… what happens?
Users get to watch
and vote for how they want the victims to be killed.
Listen, give me a second. Okay, one second. I'll be right back.
He's a good man.
[Luther] No, he's not a good man.
I know you think he sent us here to test you. But he didn't.
Look at me.
[softly] Here. Look at me, please.
There's no reason on this earth that you should be afraid.
Not anymore.
I know you tried to stop him.
That's why he did this to you.
We need to know where he is.
And I know you can tell me that because I know he enjoys telling you.
Georgette, he's got my daughter.
[Luther] Boss.
[Schenk] John.
Where are you?
In church.
They serve a nice pint there, do they?
They do.
Listen, I'm calling to tell you that I don't think we're looking for just one man.
I think we're looking for an operation.
What does that mean?
They're running a red room.
Red rooms don't exist.
They're an urban legend.
Yeah, no, that's the point.
I think he wants the world to think he's a nightmare that's come true.
That he's a bad dream, and that he can touch
anyone he wants anywhere he likes.
Where is it? This red room?
I… I cannot tell you that.
I see.
One last hurrah, is it?
One last chance to exercise that death wish
you've been carrying around for how long?
Boss, I'm sorry, okay? I know that I've let you down…
way too often.
It wasn't me you let down.
The tragedy is that you are a better man than you ever allowed yourself to be.
Well, look, I'm not going to ask you to trust me, okay?
But I am going to ask you for just one more favor.
Of course you are.
What?
Just check your texts.
Can you do that?
How can I not?
Great.
[Archie] All I know is you asked me to find her, and I found her.
I set up an alert on her passport, and she used it.
Used it where?
Passenger ferry
en route to Norway.
And the investigation knows nothing about this?
Well, that's… that's a pretty time-limited situation.
Okay, good.
Now, listen, Archie.
No, no, you don't… You listen.
Listen, listen, listen.
There's only one person that could have led DCI Raine to here.
A woman, inevitably.
I need you to pay her a little visit.
Make sure she doesn't speak to anyone else.
Look. No. No.
-Huh? Archie. Archie… -Please.
You can't just… Can't you leave me alone now?
Listen, mate, you… you have come so far.
There's no going back.
So I just want you to do this one tiny weeny little thing for me.
Yeah? And then that's it.
That's it. That's… that's your way out.
Just think of it is as opening a door to a future without me in it.
Odette, are you ready for this?
I'm doing it. I'm here.
[Luther] Yeah? Whatever comes next?
Do you have kids?
Um, no.
No, clearly not, otherwise you wouldn't have asked the question.
Ouch.
Sorry.
That was unkind.
There was never enough time for me and my wife.
And then time just, um…
ran out.
I know you lost her.
I don't get it.
What?
You seem like such a decent man.
I don't understand why you did the things you did.
Well,
I couldn't see any other way.
To do what?
What had to be done.
I know. I'm so sorry.
John told me someone would come for her.
But he didn't know who that someone might be.
Oh, but I knew.
So what does this man have on you, Archie?
And how bad could it have been for you to allow all this?
You know, the funny thing is…
it wasn't even that bad.
Not really.
According to Georgette, we're three miles out.
We're a mile and a half out.
[Raine] We can't stop.
[Anya sobbing] Mum. Mum!
No, Mum! -Baby, no, no, no, no. -[Luther] Odette. Wait. Wait. -[Anya] Help me! -Oh my God. Oh my God.
-[Anya] Help me! -Oh my God. Oh my God. [Anya sobbing] Mum!
[Anya sobbing] Mum! [Anya on device] Someone help me. Help!
[Anya on device] Someone help me. Help!
[sobbing] Oh my God!
Oh no!
It should be you! It should be you!
Oh my God!
Get out. Get out. Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! [sobs]
It's not her. John. John. [grunts]
[Robey] Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.
All right. All… all the cameras are on?
[Robey] Are we live streaming?
[Robey] Okay. All right. Let's go.
[Robey] And three, two, one.
Welcome to the Red Bunker.
All your votes are in and counted,
and you're probably expecting us to kick off proceedings with Brigida.
Actually,
one of you asked if lovely Jacov
could skin her like a snake,
which I… I have to say really tickled my funny bone.
But as it happens, we have a surprise opening act for you
as tonight's special guest is DCI…
Well, no, actually he's not DCI anymore. John Luther.
So, John.
[Robey on phone] I thought I'd kick off by asking you as a… Well, a bit of an expert in these things, apparently.
Well, a bit of an expert in these things, apparently.
Do you think I can help being what I am?
Do you think any of us can?
Mate, I couldn't give a fucking monkey's.
No, of course… [chuckles] Of course you don't.
Because you have got no idea
what it's like to be born like us.
Fuck.
To live your entire life not being able to express who you are
for fear of people like you… policing us.
But nobody needs to be alone anymore now, do they? Hmm?
Not even us,
because we can create a place where we can all come together
to express ourselves. Ah!
And to be safe. To be safe from people like you.
Mum! Mum!
-Anya. Honey. -No! -Oh my God. I'm so… -Please!
-Oh my God. I'm so… -Please! -No! Don't! -No, no, no! Mum!
-No! Don't! -No, no, no! Mum!
-Please, no! -Mum! -[inhales sharply] -[groans]
You're a fucking piece of work.
Leave her alone! Leave her!
No. No, no, no… Stop it! Don't. Stop it!
Stop it! Don't. Stop it!
-Don't fucking touch her! Get it off her! -[shushing]
Listen. Listen. There is a way out for her from this.
Listen. There is a way out for her from this.
Fuck you. Get off me. Stop it. Stop!
Odette, do you actually want to stop this?
Because you have the power to do that.
Just say the magic word.
Stop.
Please.
[Robey] Now, I didn't expect either of you two
to pitch up this evening, but since they have…
Mum, get us out of here. Mum!
[Robey] What I would like to do is…
I would like you…
to stab him.
Hmm. Would you do that for me, Odette, please?
Mum. Mum, don't do it. Mum. Mum!
I… I can't do that. I can't do that.
[Robey] You can't? Okay, well, you know what happens, don't you?
-No, stop, stop, stop! Please stop. -Mum!
Tell him to stop, please! Tell him to stop, please! Stop!
Mum!
-Okay. -Mum!
Odette.
Can you think of a better way?
[Anya] Mummy. Mum, don't. Mum! Mum!
-[Raine] Anya, close your eyes. -[Anya] Don't, please.
I said close your eyes.
[whimpering] Please.
[Luther] Just get it on with it.
-I'm so sorry. -Don't worry about it. Don't be sorry.
Do it.
-[Raine] I'm so… I'm so sorry. -Do it.
[Luther] Go on.
-Okay. -[Raine] Okay. [Luther] Okay.
There it is.
You see, for all their cloying self-righteousness,
the only difference between them and us
is who we're allowed to hurt and under what circumstances.
Now, how do they justify that to themselves?
All the… All the "good people"?
By telling themselves that we're the wicked ones.
Yeah. All them monsters are telling you all and me
that we are monsters.
Okay. [snaps fingers] Good girl.
[Robey] Good girl.
Mum. Mum.
Leave her alone! You prick, leave her alone!
[Robey] Now then…
your turn, mate.
What I'd like you to do
is to shatter her left kneecap with that.
Make it fast. Make it fast.
-You have to. Please. -I can't do it. I won't do it.
Mum! Mum!
They'll kill her. Please.
Every one of you that are watching this right now,
your IP addresses are being traced,
and the police are on their way to you.
If I were you, I'd get out of here.
It's okay. It's okay. This, this by the way, is a convicted ex-copper.
-He has no idea what he's talking about. -[Luther] Not true.
[Robey] All the evidence will be incinerated after the show.
You're safe. You're in a safe place, nobody knows that we're here.
Except for Georgette.
Yeah, she's alive. Alive and well.
And not only that, she told the police where this place is,
and they're on their way here, and they're very, very pissed off with you.
She's probably watching on one of these cameras now
and watching your stupid little face
after telling us all your embarrassing secrets.
Everyone can see you, but they can't see you like we can,
David Robey.
We know who you are and who you are ashamed of being.
Are you still grinding your teeth?
From the anxiety. Are you still doing that?
-Is that what she said? -That's what she said.
You ground your teeth most of your life, and you never managed to get ahold of it
because you're an anxious man. Anxious, weak, pathetic man.
-Is that what she said? -[Raine] Yes.
[Luther] You're doing it now. He's doing it now.
You can't see it, but he's grinding his teeth.
I do actually remember you when you stood by me at a bus stop
and offered me some Juicy Fruit.
I remember that.
I thought, "What a sweaty, anxious twat. What is wrong with him?"
John! John, go. Go!
Ah! Go, go, go!
It's all right. It's okay. Hey, hey, we're gonna go home right now.
We're going home. Okay, all right? Okay.
[Raine] We have to go. Come on. Come on.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Okay…
I need you to get away from that valve. It's kerosene.
If you don't get away from that valve, we're all gonna burn.
[in Estonian] I'd rather burn.
Get on your knees and hands behind your head. Now!
-[in English] Get back! -Get down on your knees.
[Anya] No! It's locked!
-Hey, hey, hey, open the door! -Open the door, please. -[all clamoring] -Shh. Shh.
Help, please!
Mum, I can't turn it!
No! Don't!
Mum!
Get that!
No. No.
Good. Spray.
-This way. -[Anya] Thank you.
I'm okay. Can you take her, please?
Yeah, I'm okay. Yeah. Yeah.
[Schenk] Wotcha.
Evidently, I owe you £20.
It's 50.
-Ah yes. -Yeah.
-I hoped you'd forgotten. -No.
Thank you.
You know what has to happen next, John.
[reporter] …has been named as John Luther, an ex-Metropolitan Police detective
who's believed to have sustained life-threatening injuries
after allegedly tracking the suspect…
-Wotcha. -Wotcha.
So where am I?
Ah. Safe house. Evidently.
-Government? -Government.
I think they got most of the blood out.
Nice piece of invisible mending.
Who is this lot?
Uh, not quite sure, to be honest.
But I don't think you're going back to prison.
-A job offer, perhaps? -[Luther grunts]
[man] If I may.
Unofficially…
you did a commendable job.
I promised you a president
who feels your pain and who shares your dreams.
I wanna talk to you about a fundamental threat to American democracy.
to American democracy.
For the first time in the history of our country, a majority of our people believe
that the next five years will be worse than the past five years.
Shit.
[on PA] Howdy, folks.
Apologize for the delay.
We're number 11 for takeoff.
We'll try to make it up in the air.
Just wake me up over Texas.
[Barry on PA] Apologies from the flight deck.
Just a little bit of turbulence.
[Barry] Thank you all for flying TWA tonight.
Welcome to Baton Rouge.
[announcer on radio] The people's choice...
...and for you history buffs, is in Louisiana...
[Barry] Hey, Luce.
Um, back here.
[Barry] Thank you for flying TWA.
Welcome to Vancouver.
Welcome to Bakersfield.
-Welcome to Denver. -[baby crying]
[Jimmy] I hope they put us up at the Holiday Inn tonight.
Those little cocktail gals are on fire.
Soon as they see a man in uniform, panties come off.
How about that landing in Detroit?
Oh, man. It was gusty that day.
[woman] One in Kentucky.
Thanks, Bobby.
Hey. Chivas on the rocks.
Barry.
What was that?
Barry Seal.
That's right.
You have a drop-off and pick-up service here every other Thursday.
Cuban exiles.
They pay commercial pilots to smuggle homegrown contraband
through Canadian hubs. Vancouver, Montreal.
Right?
I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.
-No? -No.
You're smuggling cigars.
You have an interesting file, Barry.
"File"?
Starts off with a bang.
Top of your class in the Civil Air Patrol.
Youngest pilot in TWA history.
You were going places.
What is going on here?
Revolution's in the air, Barry.
Central America, right now.
We're building nations down there, Barry.
We're building nations.
It's America at its fucking finest.
And we could use someone like you.
Goddamn.
You're CIA.
Holy shit.
[Barry] Hot damn! [chuckling] Look at her.
[Monty] Well, they, uh, they tell me she's pretty fast.
[Barry] Yeah. Yeah.
It's the fastest twin-engine on the planet. [Monty] Mmm.
[Barry] I mean, shit!
She looks like she's going 300 miles an hour just sitting there.
CIA owns this?
No. No.
Uh, "Independent Aviation Consultants."
"IAC."
Yeah.
Well, wait, is that... What do they call it,
one of them "front" groups? Is that...
-No, no, no. It's as real as IBM. -Uh-huh.
You'd run the company, but after-hours, you work for us.
Yeah.
-Takes pictures? -Mmm.
We say it "collects intelligence."
-Uh-huh. -[both laughing]
Where? Russia? Uh...
South of the border, north of the equator.
Let's just say, uh, "enemies of democracy."
Look, the real work is covert. You understand? -[Barry laughing] -[Monty chuckles] So...
[laughs] "Covert."
[Monty] So, uh, anyone finds out about it,
uh, family, friends, even Lucy. It's Lucy, right?
Yeah, that's right.
That'd be a problem.
What?
All this is legal?
If you're doing it for the good guys, yeah.
Just don't get caught, that... [chuckles]
You wanna take her for a spin?
Fuck it! Take her for a fucking spin! [laughs]
I want you to take her for a spin.
-It's all for me. -Mmm-hmm. It's new business. It's gonna be my business.
Okay.
-Logistical support for airports. -That's right.
Okay. And you're calling it "IAC"?
What do you know about business?
-Uh... -You are a TWA airline pilot.
That's how you support this family.
This is gonna be good for us, all right?
What about benefits? Our healthcare?
We have great healthcare with TWA. [stammers] That's...
You know, I'm sure that's not gonna be a problem.
And what the hell does "IAC" mean, anyway?
Independent Aviation Consultants.
Well, that sounds fuckin' made up, Barry.
It does?
[Barry] Flight controls free and correct.
Warning and enunciator lights.
Check on that.
-Anti-skid lights. -That's off.
-Landing gear. -Handle's down. Three green.
Speed brake lever. Stowed.
-Thrust levers. -Cut off.
-Engine start levers. -Cut off.
-Slap trim cut-off switches. -Normal.
Fire warning system?
Check.
Radius transponder radar?
Barry? Radius transponder radar?
Yeah. Check, check.
Rudder, aileron trim?
Zero, zero.
Windows?
Closed.
Flight attendant briefing?
Barry?
You're gonna be all right, Jimmy.
Where are you... Where are you going?
Barry! Barry, where are you going?
[Barry chuckles] Shit! I know, I know.
That was bold.
That was bold.
I do tend to leap before I look.
Maybe, uh... [clicks tongue]
Maybe I should have asked a few more questions.
Anyway, it was back in '78 and, uh...
It was September? October.
Anyway, it, uh...
That was the day I joined the CIA.
Now, in those days, the Cold War was in full swing.
The Soviets were backing communist insurgents all over Central America. -[screeching] -[growling]
And the CIA wanted snaps of them insurgents.
[CIA official] Now, these pictures are sensational.
Who's responsible?
They're mine.
[Gary] Hey, Monty?
Yeah.
Go fuck yourself.
Oh, shit!
Come on, now. Come on, now.
Fuck!
[announcer] The people's choice.
[Monty] So, uh... So then I show him this one.
And he goes, "God damn it, Schafer, I didn't ask for mug shots."
I mean, they say they're the best reconnaissance photos they have ever seen.
Does this mean I get a raise?
You're doing great.
Hey, you got a family, Schafer?
-[doctor] Big push! -[screams]
-Motherfucker! -[baby cries]
Wife? Kids?
See, I, uh... I didn't tell Lucy I ain't working for TWA no more.
You're serving your country.
I am gonna need some more money at some point.
You'll figure it out.
We, uh... We're sending you to Panama tomorrow.
[Barry] The CIA was so happy with my work...
they gave me another job.
Bagman.
See, there was this colonel down in Panama
named Noriega.
And he was selling the agency's intel on all the commies down there.
For your friends.
[Barry] My job was just to drop off and pick up.
Just drop off...
Pick up.
[announcer on radio] Right here in Baton Rouge.
You're listening to the best Louisiana music.
[Barry] Hey, Luce, pancakes are up.
[Lucy] Thanks, baby.
Hola.
In the car.
Hey, uh...
A dónde vamos, fellas?
Welcome.
Come on up.
Thank you for coming to see me.
Sir, I... I think there's been some sort of mistake here, because I...
These fellas just picked me up at the airport, and--
No, no. No mistake. Just, please, have a seat.
Coffee, Mr. Seal?
You know my name?
You're the gringo who flies to Central America every week...
taking pictures very low with your fancy plane.
[chuckles] Oh, yeah, I mean, uh...
Those photos... See, I have a, uh,
aviation company here in South America that I--
Yes. Yes, the AIC.
IAC. Yes, sir.
Or is it CIA?
[chuckling] What?
No... No, no, no. I'm just a businessman here.
I'm a businessman.
Imports, exports, cattle, horses.
But now...
Now, God above has blessed this great country with new riches, Mr. Seal.
And you could help us.
How's that?
You know the routes,
you can get in and out of Estados Unidos with your fancy plane.
What... What kind of riches are we talking about here?
[Ochoa] Cocaine, Mr. Seal!
We had a few difficulties getting our exports to your country, Mr. Seal.
[woman on radio] Nine-nine-nine-six.
Ma'am, what's in the bag?
We decided to try new ideas.
We want you to take off from here, fly directly to Miami.
We'll pay you $2,000 per kilo.
How much is a kilo?
2.2 pounds, Mr. Seal.
[Barry] $2,000...
every 2.2 pounds.
I... I'm sorry, fellas.
I didn't catch y'all's names.
Jorge Ochoa.
Carlos Lehder.
Pablo Escobar.
A couple of billion dollars from now, they'd be known as the Medellín Cartel.
Back then, they were just three businessmen
trying to figure out how to get their merchandise to the United States.
There was just one small problem.
See, pilots, they were killing themselves trying to get off that runway.
I see you had a few other boys try to make it outta here.
[chuckles] Si, si.
Terrible pilots.
Yeah, well...
I'm sure they were heavy, you know,
carrying a lot of fuel to make it to the States, and merchandise, and...
Yeah, you know, this airport, I mean, it's high altitude and a short runway.
And, I mean, shit, you got trees and mountains on both sides.
Is there, uh... Is there somewhere else I could take off from?
[Ochoa] Nowhere the Army wouldn't notice.
Well, uh...
Can you make the runway longer?
[Ochoa in English] They say I should get rid of you.
That you can't do it.
[Ochoa] We have our people in Miami. [Barry] Yeah.
You're gonna land at the Okeechobee airport between 2:00 and 6:00 a.m.
[Barry] Look, there's, uh...
There's been a change of plans, 'cause I ain't landing in Miami in--
-[Escobar speaks Spanish] -Thank you. Gracias.
See, I ain't landing anywhere with this stuff. That's... That's how y'all got in trouble.
Now, look, just... Just hear me out.
I know Louisiana. Now, here's a map.
Now, I'm gonna drop this stuff right where "X" marks the spot.
All right? Just... [grunts]
What do you mean, you're not gonna land, huevón?
[Barry] Okay. Now, just...
Hey. Come here, look...
Look... Just look at this.
Look.
See right here?
See that there?
Right there is your million-dollar door.
All right. You just go around. Each side.
But tight.
No, no, no. No more.
I said no more.
But there's plenty of room, gringo.
No, no, no. [speaking Spanish]
Guys, guys, it ain't about room, all right? It's about weight.
Now, we agreed on 200, I even put on 300.
No, no, no. [speaking Spanish]
Keep pushing. Come on. Need all the runway I can get.
Keep going. Keep going.
[in English] Hold! Hold!
Gracias, gracias.
Where the hell do you think you're going, big fella?
Come on. Out.
He's gonna guard our product.
This guy's fatter than fuck.
I'm already 1,500 pounds overweight.
Either I fly the big fella or I fly your product.
Good luck, hermano. Christ will keep you safe.
He ain't gonna make this runway any longer.
Hey, Jorge. Come here, give me that.
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on!
Oh, Jesus!
I've got a possible target headed due north 25 miles offshore.
That's platform 14. One of Shell's helicopters.
You can disregard.
Cheers! Cheers!
Barry. [speaks Spanish]
-Wow. -[laughs]
For you.
[in English] Was that, uh, "Wednesday"?
You want me to go... He wants me to go again on Wednesday?
Yes. Next Wednesday.
[Barry] Well, what about the, uh, that runway?
Pablo! Jorge!
[in English] Wait here, Barry. Wait here.
-[Barry] Are we running? -Uh-uh. [clicks tongue]
What...
What is that? You want me to wait here?
Pablo?
[Barry] Oh, God.
-Don't shoot! -[soldier speaks Spanish]
No, no, no.
[Monty] Barry?
Barry Seal.
Schafer?
-Barry Seal? -Schafer?
Yeah. No, no, no. Oh, my God!
You look terrible.
It is so good to see you.
-You missing a tooth? -Yeah.
-Listen-- -What the fuck?
-See these fellas right here? -Yeah.
I think they know that I am CIA.
You're not CIA.
You're a drug smuggler, Barry.
Listen, Louisiana PD was notified of your arrest here.
They're gonna raid your house at 6:00 a.m.
They're gonna pick up Lucy, bring her in for questioning.
Maybe even keep her overnight.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. You gotta get me out of here.
Well, maybe...
Maybe we could figure something out.
[Barry] Okay, you can... You can stop now if you want.
'Cause, believe me,
shit gets crazy from here.
Do you remember them fellas that I told you I was taking snaps of?
Turns out they was a bunch of commies.
Called themselves "Sandinistas."
These fellas managed to get their shit together
and take control right here in this little country called Nicaragua.
Oh, no, that's El Salvador.
Here you go. Nicaragua.
[announcer] Theirs is the first successful revolution in Central America.
[Barry] Now, that may have been bad news for some people,
but not for me.
See, there was a new sheriff in town.
My fellow Americans, I must speak to you tonight
about a mounting danger in Central America.
[Barry] Even after everything that happened, I...
I still love Ronnie Reagan.
I mean, any man that can make it from that monkey movie
all the way to the White House...
-[banging] -What's the matter with him?
[Barry] ...he's gotta know what the hell he's doing.
And what he wanted was to kick them commie Sandinistas out of Nicaragua.
And he wanted the Nicaraguan freedom fighters, called "Contras," to do it.
They need to know that the U.S. supports them
with more than just pretty words and good wishes.
[Barry] But Congress, well, they smelled the makings of another Vietnam,
and they outright refused to let Ronnie have his war.
But do you think them politicians could tell the Gipper what to do?
Hell no. He turned to the CIA,
and the CIA turned to me.
Schafer? So, Schafer, that morning raid on my family, that's off now, right?
No, no. That's, uh... That's still happening.
-What? -6:00 a.m.
This fucking country!
-Well, hold on, now. -Stop!
Now, we have a deal!
I'm not a cop, Barry.
I can't make a search warrant go away, you know?
Things are in motion here.
Come on, man. What the hell am I gonna do?
I suggest you get your family outta Louisiana.
Well, where am I supposed to take them?
We got a place for ya.
Mena.
Arkansas.
Arkansas?
[Barry] Hey.
-Mmm. -Hey, Luce.
Mmm. Hey, baby.
Hey, hey, hey.
My God, baby, what happened to you?
I'm okay.
Barry, you're missing a tooth.
-Hey, uh... -[clock ticking]
We're moving.
We gotta pack everything up.
We gotta be outta here before the sun comes up.
So, we'll get these dresses and...
You need all them shoes?
Well, hey there, sunshine.
How you doing?
Now, look. I'm gonna give you a plastic bag.
What I want you to do is you go upstairs and you put your favorite toys--
Go on back to bed, honey. Daddy done lost his mind.
No. Darlin', you listen to Daddy.
You go do that 'cause we're going on an adventure.
[Lucy] No, we're not going on an adventure.
Like the time we went camping in the parish?
Not actually, but...
'Cause every adventure is different.
Oh, my God. You're actually serious right now.
Barry, it's 4:00 a.m., I'm not moving.
Christina's school play is tomorrow.
Hey, do you trust me?
No!
But you love me. You do love me.
Yeah, of course, I fucking love you.
Then, listen, we gotta move.
And we gotta get outta here before the sun comes up.
Look at that. They got barbecue.
It's got a lot of charm.
This place has got a lot of charm.
[Sheriff Downing] Plenty. But all we got's a porta-potty out back.
And I think that'd be cruel and unusual punishment. Right?
Well, I'll be sure to give 'em a good what for on Monday, though.
All right?
[Christina] Thank you.
[Barry] Front door's open.
[shushing] It's okay.
That's... That's an easy fix.
I gotta...
Get in. Come on.
Oh, shit.
We gotta make this quick.
She might leave me before I get back.
So, this is all yours.
Including everything between here and your house.
Almost 2,000 acres.
What do you think?
I own all this?
Oh, yeah.
This whole airport?
Yeah. Congratulations.
[Monty] AK-47s.
Soviet-made for the PLO.
The Israelis captured these and then secretly traded them to us.
And you're gonna fly 'em to Nicaragua.
Uh, you didn't say nothing about guns.
It's a war, Barry.
Freedom fighters can't put up much of a fight if they aren't armed.
This was the deal.
Or would you rather be in a Colombian prison?
This is every current law enforcement investigation on the Gulf Coast.
FBI, ATF, DEA, Customs.
These maps will help you avoid all of 'em.
Holy shit.
You'd just fly where they ain't.
Everything in this hangar's mine?
Oh, yeah.
-That truck's mine? -Mmm-hmm.
Tools are mine?
Yes, sir.
This airplane's mine.
Bag is mine.
What bag?
[Lucy] I fed the kids.
They're sleeping.
Unpacked the car.
That's good.
Fixed the sink. Just a valve.
See? I told you that was gonna be easy.
Fuck, Barry!
Okay. All right! All right. Okay.
I'm gonna come clean.
I don't work for TWA no more.
No shit, Barry.
Are you going to prison?
No, ma'am. [chuckles]
You've gotta take care of this family.
'Cause I will take the kids.
I will go right back to working for Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Luce, what I'm working on, it's--
Barry, I am six months pregnant.
It's top secret.
I need a fridge.
I need beds for our children.
I need a stove, a fucking washing machine...
Washing machine over there, all right?
Now, let me just...
Is this all legal?
All right. What I'm about to tell you, you... You...
You gotta swear you can't ever tell anybody this, Lucy.
All right?
[whispers] I am working...
for the CIA.
[Barry] Hola.
Howdy, amigos.
I am here on behalf of Uncle Sam.
[Barry] Look, Schafer. I ain't no military expert,
but are you sure these are the right guys?
'Cause they seemed a damn sight more interested in my boots than in your guns.
[Monty over phone] Now, look. This is getting big time.
Schafer, I just don't think I'm the guy for this.
You just keep delivering that pizza, hear me?
You just keep delivering.
[Barry] Hola.
All right.
These are gifts.
All right?
All right? Gifts.
[in English] Back off. Off.
Now, these guns are gifts from Uncle Sam.
I'm not fucking around.
Barry! Put the bat down, huevón.
We're all friends here.
Jorge.
What the hell are you doing here?
[Ochoa] This is Don Adolfo Calero.
He works for your government on the revolution
to bring down the Sandinistas.
Jorge tells me you are the crazy gringo who always delivers.
[Ochoa] We have a new business proposition to you, Barry.
You bring your American guns to Colombia,
deliver our cocaine here, to the Contras.
The Contras take it by fishing boats to Miami...
And everybody's happy.
It's for the war effort, Mr. Seal.
[Barry] Turns out, the Contras didn't really want to fight a war.
They just wanted to make money.
Like the rest of us.
Meanwhile, the Medellín Cartel wanted guns.
So they worked out a little trade. What was I gonna tell 'em?
I'm just a gringo who always delivers.
Here's how the operation worked.
I'd load up with guns in Mena,
then, using Schafer's intel, I'd bypass any law enforcement
and fly straight to the Cartel's airstrip in Medellín.
[Barry] The Colombians, well, they loved them guns.
And I'd load up with fresh powder... and fly on to the Contra training camp.
The Contras hid the coke in fishing boats and sailed it up to Miami.
Meanwhile, I'd get another load of powder,
take it back to the States with a quick stop to refuel in Panama
under the protection of my old friend, Colonel Noriega.
Congratulations on your promotion, General.
'Course, he'd get his cut, too.
On the way back, I'd keep an eye out for the DEA
and then I'd dump it all in the swamps of Louisiana.
The operation got so big, I had to get some help.
Pete Dubois manufactured guns
until he discovered he had a knack for selling pot.
Stan Mason flew dope from Mexico to Arizona.
Bill Cooper. He flew opium all around Southeast Asia during Vietnam.
Then there's Bob. Uh...
I don't know much about Bob. Hell of a pilot, though.
I called these boys my "Snowbirds,"
and we could fly through anything.
Schafer!
Barry.
How's it going?
[Bill] Hey, boss!
That was fucking crazy, man! Whoo! [laughs]
How's it, uh... How's it going down there?
Oh, you know...
Busy.
You?
Oh, yeah.
Busy.
Where are they going?
We need to borrow some of your land.
They want you to fly 'em up here to... To train.
For training.
Who?
The Contras.
You... You want me to bring 'em up here?
To Mena?
We're setting up a field and operational training ground.
Where? On...
-On my land? -Yeah.
Starting immediately.
Which is great.
Is that a problem?
No.
Hey...
Whatever you need, boss.
Hang on! We're supposed to have 15.
I'm only counting 12 here.
Them Contras were damn excited about being in the U.S. of A.
And they were running away almost faster than we could bring 'em in.
[CIA man] Hey, you two! Where you think you're going?
Wow. You wanna quadruple the shipments?
We're confident the Contras can win by summer
if we give 'em what they need.
That's great.
[Winter] How much more can you get out of your guy in Mena?
[Monty] Oh, we'll get everything out of him.
That's what I like to hear.
We're expanding operations, Barry.
[Barry] Come on, now. One at a time!
Just one at a time! Hey, hold on! Hold on!
-[all clamoring] -No, no, no.
We'll take care of everybody.
[in English] Back! Hands off!
Please. Back! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[in English] Everyone, just calm the fuck down!
[in English] Hey, Barry.
Yeah?
You think those Contras can win?
No.
[Sheriff Downing] Hi.
This just came. "Go Razorbacks. Barry."
Season tickets.
Fifty-yard line.
Well, that was awful nice of him.
How much property has Seal bought up since he came to town?
I don't know, 500 acres?
Two thousand acres. From the airport to Ouachita.
What's he want with all that worthless land?
It's... It's really none of our business, really.
He's good people, Judy.
He's doing a lot for the community.
I'd like to open a bank account.
Oh. Bless you!
I'll be right back.
David!
-[Lucy] Come on, Christina! -[crowd applauding]
-[man] Good job, guys, good job! -Whoo!
-[Lucy] Way to go, Christina! -Go, go, go!
Oranges. You guys want some oranges?
[Lucy] Hey, guys, I got pizza!
-You guys want some pizza? -[kids] Yeah!
Here you go! All right. Let me just put this right...
There you go.
-Nice wheels! -Oh, you like her?
[chuckles] I do.
1982.
All the bells and whistles.
First one in the state of Arkansas, and she's yours.
She's mine?
She's yours.
Oh, my God, Barry!
Thank you!
-Wow. -A little something extra in there.
Fuck me, Barry!
What?
Okay. You need to behave.
[Lucy] I brought some snacks out for you, Christina.
[Barry] By the summer of '82...
business was a-boomin'.
Got us at Tuesday, three o'clock. Tuesday at three o'clock.
[Ochoa on phone] We need to increase the shipments.
Can you add a Friday delivery?
-Friday? Okay. Hold on, now. -[phone ringing]
Yeah?
We wanna double the amount of guns we're bringing in.
[Barry] Double?
[Monty] Next batch by Friday.
[stammers] Oh, hold on. Does... Does it have to be Friday?
[Barry] I opened a few front corporations.
I can't wait to learn everything there is to know
I can't wait to learn everything there is to know about the sign business, Mr. Seal.
Me, too.
I spent 30 years working the pumps at Gas N' Sip.
Well, sir, I think it's about time you moved to upper management.
But the money was coming in faster than I could launder it.
[Barry] I was taking pictures, delivering guns...
dropping off and picking up.
[chuckles] Damn, I was building an air force.
-New toy, boys! -[all laugh]
-I wanted to get new books. -[Lucy] You did?
What're you doing? Barry!
[Lucy] Smile, Barry.
-[Barry] Jorge! -[Ochoa speaks Spanish]
[in English] Lobsters! Oh, you remembered!
What'd I tell you? You think I'm gonna forget that?
Your husband is a genius.
Well, it absolutely, positively has to be delivered overnight.
Esposa, Lucy.
-No, no, no. -[speaking Spanish]
[Barry] I had my fingers in every pie on the rack.
Ten million in Mena National,
twelve million in Mena State,
fifteen in Mena Trust.
I had 40 parked in Miami,
twenty in Panama, seven million in lawn bags,
eight in Samsonites, four buried in the woods behind my house,
and 90 pounds of gold in my closet.
Hot damn!
Oh, honey, watch the yoke.
If this ain't the greatest country in the world. Ah!
JB.
Yeah.
-Hey, sis! -JB!
[JB] What the fuck?
Look at you!
-Look at you! -God damn!
Get in here.
Look at this fucking house!
Parking a Chevy's a lot harder than it fucking looks, Luce.
Hey! Watch your mouth around the kids.
-Sorry. -[videogame running]
That right?
[JB] Yeah, man.
They had me cramming those S-10s
into every goddamn inch of the parking lot...
[Lucy] Hey, you heard me!
I'm sorry!
Look, the thing is, is that the cars were so close to each other, right,
-you couldn't help but scratch, right? -[Barry] Yeah.
Then they would take the scratches out of my fucking paycheck, man!
-[Lucy] Hey! JB! -[JB] Sorry.
Well, I don't know how you handle the pressure, JB.
You're staying here, you're getting a job.
Or, you know, I could just give you some folding cash, you go on and do what you want.
-Don't you look at him like that. -[JB] What?
You are getting a job, JB, not a handout.
My brother's getting a job, Barry.
You're getting a job.
Definitely.
Well, you hear that? That's the law.
You're gonna have to work, son.
-Gonna have to work. -[Lucy] That's right.
[JB] Uh, what is it I'll be doing, exactly?
Yo, Barry!
Hey, Barry.
Barry! What now, JB?
So this is a big hangar, and I'm tired of sweeping.
You can take a break when you get it done.
Let's go. Get it done!
[Bill] Hey, man, I got a new job for you.
Get me a beer, man.
Dead soldier.
Here's your fucking...
[Lucy] Barry?
Yeah?
Roscoe dug this up in the backyard.
There are bills blowing around everywhere.
I'll rake it up in the morning.
I found three more of 'em up in the fireplace.
Shit.
We had cash flooding in from every direction.
Who... Who thought that was gonna be a problem? I mean...
We were running out of places to put it.
Easy. Whoa.
Don't get behind 'em. These are dangerous animals.
You know, maybe you should call the trainer. No, honey, I got this.
Come on, now.
Hang on.
[JB] What you think of that?
[girl] Holy shit!
JB got a new car.
Did you give that boy a raise?
[JB] Hey, Barry, Luce!
What in the holy fuck?
That girl is 15.
-It's huge! -I told you it was huge!
-You actually live here? -Uh-huh.
Hey! Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.
-What? -Come here.
[Lucy] What the hell, JB?
What?
I haven't done nothing yet!
-JB. Come on. -Hi, Miss Seal.
What... We were just gonna go for a swim.
Come here.
Please don't tell my mama that I was here.
[Lucy] Come on, honey. Let's go inside.
Where'd you get the money for this car?
I'm gonna be honest with you, Barry, 'cause I can't lie to you.
I stole it from the hangar.
All right.
I opened up one of the Samsonites. I found so much fucking money in there, man.
-JB, JB, JB. -So much goddamn money.
JB, you can't do that.
You can't do that.
[Pete] 500 down 300.
Watch out for that tree at the end.
[Barry] Yeah, I remember that.
No, Pete, you gotta turn that off. I can't see nothing with it on.
[Pete] Gotcha.
Seventy-five. Fifty.
[exhales sharply] Nicely done, boss.
You boys see this?
Oh! Fuck!
[man on radio] This is the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.
You are in violation of the Air Defense Identification Zone.
We are ordering you to land immediately.
Follow us to New Orleans NAS.
All right, boys. It's gonna be a long night.
Let's go back out to sea, 105 knots.
Get them flaps down.
[man on radio] I repeat, we are ordering you to land immediately.
[Barry] The DEA was using these fancy new jets that we couldn't outrun.
[man on radio] Follow us to New Orleans NAS.
[Barry] But all that speed comes at a heavy price.
[man on radio] I repeat...
[Barry] They could go fast...
but we could go slow.
For a long time.
[automated voice] Low fuel. Low fuel.
-[beeping] -We gotta turn around, guys. We're bingo.
Those pricks are right fucking there!
[Barry on radio] All right, boys.
DEA finally ran out of gas. Time to head home.
[Pete] Bill! The fuck, man?
Where you headed, buddy? Come on.
[Barry] All right, I'll get him. I'll get him.
Bill? Come on, turn around. Come on, let's go.
Bill? You hear me?
Oh, son of a bitch!
Bill's asleep.
[laughs] God damn!
[Barry] Bill, wake... Wake up, man!
[Pete] That motherfucker can sleep anywhere.
-Wake up, Bill. -[Pete laughing]
[Barry] Bill!
[Barry] Morning, Bill!
[Bill] Okay, I'm up, I'm up.
Welcome back.
Those bank financials that you asked for.
[McCall] Yeah.
There's a lot of money in Mena, Arkansas.
Thanks.
I think you're gonna appreciate what we've done here, Barry.
You're making me my own vault?
Oh, no, no. We're using this auxiliary for all our other customers.
We gave you the main vault.
How 'bout that!
[man on radio] Aerostar 2-1-niner-3-golf.
Head for New Orleans Naval Air Station at once.
Yeah. Come on, come on, come on!
You better run, you prick.
[man on radio] This is the United States Border Patrol.
[Barry] Shit.
[man on radio] We are ordering you to land.
[Barry] Hey, boys.
I see you finally got smart and got a slower plane.
Two of 'em.
[man on radio] That's right, son.
We up here as long as you want.
Aerostar, we are ordering you to land immediately.
[Barry] Ha. All right, motherfuckers. Let's land.
[man on radio] I repeat, we are ordering you to land...
What the fuck?
Stay on him.
Shit!
-Oh, shit! -[car horn blares]
Is this your yard?
All right. Well, that's for the damage.
And, uh, here's a little something extra for your sister.
Hey, little darlin'.
And your bike.
All right.
You never saw me.
[Gary] "A plane crashed in Louisiana with 200 kilos of Colombian powder."
Two hundred.
-Right. -Is that your boy?
I'm sorry, are you working for the fucking DEA now?
Interesting read.
I got it.
-[Ochoa] Hello, amigo. -Sí.
We had to get out of Colombia in the middle of the night.
[Barry] I wasn't the only one having trouble with the DEA.
[Ochoa] Escobar's gone crazy and declared war on the government.
[Barry] Thanks to Pablo Escobar's unique management style...
the cartel found themselves kicked out of Colombia.
The only place the DEA couldn't touch him?
That's right. Nicaragua.
[Ochoa] We're going to meet Señor Vaughan.
He's the Minister of Interiors.
He controls the airstrips.
It's how we get you in.
[Escobar in Spanish] Barry, just sit and keep your mouth shut.
-Here's your butter, sir. -Thank you.
You're welcome.
What's up?
How you doing?
Stop running!
-[JB] Fuck! -[tires screech]
-Hey, Luce, you hear me? -[Lucy] Yes.
-Honey? You all right? -Yeah, I can hear you.
Honey, I hate to tell you this right now, but JB has been arrested.
-That little shit. -[Barry] What happened?
[Lucy] I don't know. He got caught with a whole lot of money, the dumb fuck.
-[Barry] Honey... -What do you want me to do here, babe?
There ain't nothing to do, really. Uh...
I'm just in a meeting. And we'll go over that when I get home.
All right? I'll take care of that.
All right. Hurry, Barry.
All right? You just sit tight. I love you.
Okay.
How much? [speaks Spanish]
[in English] That's 15...
[Ochoa] Fifteen-hundred kilos, Barry.
-Fifteen-hundred? -Sí.
In one go.
In one go?
-[both] Sí. -[scoffs]
Well, we ain't never done that before. That's...
[Lehder] Sanctuary isn't cheap.
[scoffs] That's a lot.
Can you do it?
Yeah, I'm gonna... I'm gonna get home.
Right now. I'm gonna leave, and then... we'll figure it out.
I'll figure it out.
Get it fucking done!
Fucking lawyer doesn't know shit.
I got two fucking priors, man, and he doesn't understand.
No, no, no. He does understand.
-And you gotta do what he tells you to do. -[phone ringing]
[JB] No, he doesn't, man.
One more strike, man, one more strike and I could go to prison
-for life, man. -JB?
JB, just hold on.
Barry? Barry, are you there?
[boy] Daddy!
Hey, darlin'.
What's that? Hold on.
-Yeah? -[Ochoa] Barry.
We've been trying to get a hold of you, amigo.
Yeah, I know that, amigo.
Listen, could you hold on? I'll be right back.
-JB? -[JB] Yeah.
There's some people that wanna talk to me.
No, no, no. You don't talk to anyone about anything.
Now, you do what that lawyer tells you to, and you keep your fuckin' mouth shut.
I'm taking care of this.
Okay.
Listen, Jorge.
We gotta put on the brakes for a bit.
"Brakes"? No, no, no. No brakes.
We have product to move.
I understand, amigo. But I got a family situation.
Your brother-in-law? We know all about it.
We'll handle it, amigo.
No, no, no. I don't want you to handle it.
Barry, listen.
-I got it. I got this. -Barry.
Listen to me. We'll handle it. Okay?
-No, no, no. Jorge-- -So don't worry.
-Jorge... Jorge... -We'll talk business later.
[boy] I don't want to see Daddy no more.
[JB] Barry, they don't... They don't know about all them suitcases you got
or what you got in them planes.
The guns you got. They don't know anything about it.
We're good, man.
I can't fix this, you hear?
They're gonna give you ten... Ten years for not talking.
That's ten years people gotta worry you will.
But I didn't say anything, man! You can talk to the goddamn lawyer.
Where we going, man?
Jesus Christ! I'm fuckin' family.
We're family!
That's right.
We're family.
What's this?
Inside's a passport, first-class ticket to Bora Bora, and enough cash...
Enough cash to make a damn good life for yourself.
Now, you're gonna get in that car
and you're gonna drive straight to Dallas/Fort Worth airport.
And nowhere else.
You don't even stop to take a piss. You hear me?
Yeah, I hear you.
Good luck, kid.
I'll tell you what, Barry.
I'm gonna send you a goddamn address. Okay, Barry?
You're gonna start sending me cash on the fucking regular.
You understand? You hear me?
Fuckin' goddamn fuckin' dick, all high-and-mighty.
Piece of shit.
Oh, and Barry...
fuck you, man! Fuck you and my cunt sister.
Excuse me? Did you just...
Money every week, asshole!
What the fuck?
What? Oh, shit.
Hey! Hey. Barry.
Oh, my God.
[Bill] Hey, Barry. Barry!
What do you need, Bill? What do you need? What do you need?
[Bill] Hey, man... Man...
I'm, like, freaking out, man. What is going on with JB?
Huh? Don't worry about JB.
[Bill scoffs] What if he talks, man?
He ain't gonna.
[Bill] Yeah, but what if he does?
He ain't gonna talk, Bill.
How do you know?
I am fucking positive!
[Bill] Okay, man.
Good. I'm gonna trust you on this one, man.
Good.
[man] In the calendar year, your operations have transported
10,500 Russian AKs to the Contras.
Yeah. Five thousand of which
have found themselves in the hands of the Colombian cartel.
Right. But...
Out of the 916 Contras brought into the United States to train,
only half made it back to Nicaragua.
-Half is-- -The other half are in the wild.
What's going on here?
Oh, yeah, the... We had to send the Contras home.
-[Barry] Home? -Yeah.
They weren't fighting.
That's the reality of that situation.
[sighs] You know, it didn't help that their guns were in Colombia.
Did it, Barry?
So...
What now?
Mmm. We'll call ya.
Call me?
Schafer?
Hey, Schafer!
Who the fuck's Schafer?
Okay, everybody, you know the drill. Everybody gets a burn bag.
Into it, you put anything with Barry Seal's face or name on it.
Come on, boys. We gotta move.
We gotta get all this stuff out of here.
-Pete. -[Pete] What? Everything?
Come on, boys, let's go. We gotta move this out.
Let's go! Let's go!
[Monty] Into the burn bag. Go!
Purchase orders. Aircraft invoices.
Be a team here. Let's move it out.
Holy shit, man.
Look at all these guns. We gotta move all of it.
Where we supposed to put all of this stuff?
Just get it off my property.
Anything with the word "Mena."
Fuel bills, memos, names, directives, photos.
Anything like that.
Anything which can link us with him, you put it in the burn bag.
And then what do you do with it?
-[man] Burn it. -You burn it.
[Bill] Bob, need a little help back here.
[Bob] In the back!
[Pete] Give me a hand with this shit.
[Bill] Got it.
[DEA agent 1] Seal! DEA!
Back away from the truck with your hands in the air.
[DEA agent 2] Drop the fucking box, shithead!
-Show us your hands! -Drop the fucking box!
[DEA agent 2] Nice and high!
ATF!
Drop your weapons!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! DEA! -Lower your guns!
ATF! Put your guns down!
Stand down!
-[DEA agent 1] It's cool! -Everybody's friends here. DEA, all right?
-This is our collar. -[DEA agent 1] Bullshit!
No, no, no.
[officer] State Police!
What the fuck are y'all doing in my county?
[McCall] Nobody move!
FBI!
Ah, fuck.
Well, hey, boys, how about my phone call?
[automated voice] We're sorry.
You have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service.
Oh, shit.
If you feel you have reached this recording in error,
-please check the number and try... -Come on, Seal.
You know who I am, Mr. Seal?
No, ma'am.
I'm Dana Sibota, State Attorney General.
You've got DEA, ATF, FBI, all wanting their pound of flesh.
Yes, ma'am, it's... It's quite a room.
Yeah. Well, you hit the trifecta, didn't you?
I mean, guns, drugs, money laundering.
And the state of Arkansas is gonna rip the bark right off of you, boy.
We are gonna put you in a four-by-six cell for the rest of your life.
Ma'am, that's a long time.
Yeah.
[woman on speaker] Miss Sibota, I have Governor Clinton on the line.
He says it's urgent.
It's the Governor.
It's your governor.
Put him through. Clear the room. Take him with you.
Yeah?
What do you need, Bill?
[Barry] Did y'all know
that Caddies have more trunk space than any other car in the world?
I'll get each and every one of you a Caddy.
You'd do that for all of us?
Yes, sir. I would.
I'd get all y'all Caddies. Have 'em here this afternoon.
What are you trying to do, Seal? Add another 20 for bribery?
[Barry] Oh, no, no, no.
I'm just offering y'all Caddies for your troubles.
What troubles, Seal, hmm?
Well, bringing me down here, for one. You see...
I'm gonna walk out of here.
I'm gonna walk out of here.
And there ain't a damn thing any one of you can do about it.
[ATF agent] All right.
Do it.
-Wait. Wait. Wait a minute. -No, no.
-No, he's free to go, boys. -What the fuck?
[McCall] What the hell do you mean, "He's free to go"?
[DEA agent] You want to explain what's going on here?
-[Dana] He's free to go. -[DEA agent 2] Free to go?
You boys should've taken the Caddies.
I'll be seeing you, Seal.
Ma'am.
[Barry] I tell you,
it is good to see you boys, I ain't gonna lie.
But I figured you'd have to show up, see?
'Cause I just know too much.
Schafer sent you, right?
Who the fuck is Schafer?
All right, all right now.
Seriously, fellas, who are you?
Usually, I talk with you from my office in the West Wing of the White House,
but tonight, there's something special to talk about.
And I've asked someone very special to join me.
Are we going...
[President Reagan] Nancy?
Not long ago, I was asked by a group of children what to do if they were offered drugs.
And I answered, "Just say no."
Drug criminals are ingenious.
So we must be smarter and stronger and tougher than they are.
Say yes to your life.
And when it comes to drugs and alcohol,
just say no.
You a pilot?
I've been known to fly some.
Me, too.
Air National Guard.
-'68, '69. -Oh.
[Vice President Bush] Junior?
Well...
I'll see you around, flyboy.
[Barry] All right.
The Sandinistas are burning the American flag in the streets.
Please. There is no deal if we don't get the Sandinistas.
-Then there's no deal. -Horseshit.
There's no deal unless we get Medellín.
[Barry] Now, you may be wondering why my ass wasn't in jail at this point.
This is disgusting!
[Barry] But I gotta be honest. Frankly, so was I.
-[Rangel] Ollie... -[Colonel North] Oh, please!
[Barry] This fella here is with the DEA.
And this fella here is a colonel named Ollie North.
Reagan's go-to guy.
The DEA just wants to nail the Medellín Cartel once and for all.
Now, at the same time, Colonel North wants to prove
the commies in Central America are involved in the drug trade.
Let me say that again.
This is disgusting!
[Barry] Colonel North wants to prove the commies are dealing drugs.
And why am I in the room?
'Cause I'm the gringo who always delivers.
So, you want me to keep going?
For your country.
We're gonna bring these guys down.
And you're gonna be a hero.
All right, then.
They put me right back in business.
Now, I'm working for the White House.
[Rangel] All right, you have three cameras.
Fifty picture loads each.
You have one here in a bag.
The sightline goes straight down the back to where those gentlemen are now.
You have two more cameras above each door.
Sightlines directly in front of the door.
Each camera has a cord.
You just press this button to take a picture.
And that's it.
Let's go.
I can see the cords, Barry.
Yeah.
I can see this damn cord, which means they gonna be able to see it.
We'll hide it.
I'm not a photographer.
-Your thumb work? -Yeah.
Well, you just push the button.
When am I supposed to push the button?
When the guys are standing here holding the powder.
You know what? Fuck it, Pete. I'll take the pictures.
[Pete] Fuck!
[Barry] Listen. What's gonna happen with these photos?
Who exactly is going to be looking at 'em?
These photos are gonna be on a need-to-know basis.
"Need-to-know."
They're gonna be classified at the highest levels, Barry.
[boy] Daddy! Daddy!
-[Barry] Classified. -Daddy!
We do recognize the dangers involved here.
No, you don't.
Well, you could always tell us to fuck off
and spend the next 30 years in Leavenworth.
[Pete] Come on, boss!
Let's get this over with!
We'll see ya, Rangel.
-[Lucy] Smile, Barry! -[son] Bye, Daddy!
Shit! There's a fucking army out there.
They're gonna torture us...
Pull our tongues out through our necks.
That ain't helping, Pete.
They're gonna cut us up in little pieces and feed us to the pigs.
I don't wanna be fed to no pigs, Barry.
Gotta keep our shit together. Hola!
We're gonna get the yayo,
take these damn pictures, then get the hell out of here.
Let's keep our shit together.
No, no, no.
[Barry] Amigos... They're going to hear that goddamn camera, Barry.
-Amigos. -[all speaking Spanish]
Escobar. Ochoa.
[Barry] Hey, hola.
[Barry] Hey, Jorge!
Jorge. Fuck!
Come on, man.
A little help?
Shoot the gringos.
-What? -Shoot the gringos!
-What's that? -Shoot the gringos! Shoot the gringos!
-[men shouting] -No, no, no!
You fucker.
Pete, stand the fuck up.
[Ochoa in English] They are shaking. You're shaking.
Look at this! Hey!
He pissed himself, man.
You got me. That was a good one.
That was a good one.
I saved your life, Barry.
-I saved your life, eh? -Yes, you did.
-Remember that. -Yeah.
Remember. Crazy gringo.
Come here, Barry.
[Barry] Hey, Jorge.
Now, let's go say hi to Pablo.
Pablo's here?
Sí. He's paranoid, amigo. On edge.
-Thinks everyone is out to get him. -Hola! Pablo!
[Barry in Spanish] Let's do this.
What?
Everything good?
I'm here.
I'm here.
And I brought your Harleys.
[in English] We're still friends?
[in English] That was a good one that you pulled right there.
You really got me.
Hey, you know, I'm gonna have to get you back.
[Barry] Jorge...
look at this, my friend.
[Pete] Say cheese, motherfuckers.
[Barry] We're gonna make history.
-[Rangel] Barry Seal! -[man] Yeah!
Barry Seal! He's a goddamn genius.
There seems to be no crime to which the Sandinistas will not stoop.
[on TV] This is an outlaw regime.
The Sandinistas have even involved themselves in the international drug trade.
I know every American parent concerned about the drug problem will be outraged
to learn that top Nicaraguan government officials
are deeply involved in drug trafficking.
This picture, secretly taken at a military airfield outside Managua
shows Federico Vaughan,
a top aide to one of the nine comandantes who rule Nicaragua...
Fuck!
...loading an aircraft with illegal narcotics bound for the United States.
[Lucy] Those motherfuckers!
That's your fucking face, Barry!
This is an outlaw regime.
[Lucy] Oh, my God!
[Ochoa in Spanish] He betrayed us!
Pablo, we have to take care of this immediately.
That son of a bitch. I'm going to rip his head off!
[Rangel on phone] I am truly sorry, Barry.
North jumped the gun.
Yeah, well, you boys fucked me good.
We all got fucked.
Those photos weren't supposed to be released,
and certainly not until we had the Colombians in custody.
Yeah, well, they ain't gonna be coming for you.
Barry, you knew the risks when you took those pictures.
You knew what you were doing.
Barry?
Barry, you there?
Let's go get some ice cream.
[Barry] The Feds, they're gonna try to take everything.
When they come...
you gotta put on all your jewelry.
All right? All your rings, you know, your bracelets.
Necklace.
'Cause if you're wearing it, they can't take it away from you.
You understand?
All right, that's insurance for you and the kids.
All right?
I understand.
All right. And don't forget that it's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right. I love you.
[Lucy] I love you.
[Barry] Sure enough, they came.
And they took it all.
Hey, Luce, honey...
I was thinking...
that you might like to move back to Baton Rouge.
[Lucy] You ain't gonna find nothing in those drawers.
Try the hat boxes, third shelf up.
I mean, you loved it there.
What about you?
I mean, I'm...
Me, uh...
Listen, you see...
Look, if I run, they're, uh...
they're gonna come for you and the kids, I mean...
That's how a thing like this goes, but, Baton Rouge, you're safe.
No.
[scoffs] No, I ain't going nowhere.
We're a family and we're staying together.
I know. But-- No, sir. I ain't doing this.
-Listen, Luce. Luce. -No.
No, no. Honey, hang on. Don't do this now.
-No, sir, sir! I'm sorry. -[Lucy] You know what?
No, no, no, sir. Come on, sir.
Excuse me, she's wearing this now.
Luce, you gotta stop. Hey, you know, fellas...
Sorry, hey...
Can I just have a moment... Can I just have a moment with my wife?
It's been a hell of a day. [chuckles]
-[FBI agent] Okay, Barry. -Yeah.
You got one minute.
All right. Luce?
-Honey, now listen to me. -[man] Let's give him a minute.
Baby, baby, listen to me.
-[man] All right, folks. Head on out. -Listen to me.
I'm gonna go to prison.
I'm gonna do just... Just a little time.
And I'm gonna be fine there.
And we're gonna work everything out,
but I gotta know you're gonna be safe.
It's gonna be all right.
You gotta trust me.
I mean, you trust me, right?
Fuck no!
All right.
[Barry] Luce and the kids finally did move to Baton Rouge.
[Dana] How can we have a war on drugs when the biggest enemy of the state
[Dana] How can we have a war on drugs when the biggest enemy of the state is being protected by our side?
[Barry] And that lady prosecutor...
[Dana] Why, he never informed the FBI...
[Barry] ...she never, ever did give up.
...that any such sting operation was underway.
[bailiff] Defendant will rise.
-[Judge] Barry Seal. -Your Honor.
You are sentenced to 1,000 hours community service.
-[gavel bangs] -Dismissed.
-[Dana] Oh, that is bullshit. -[Judge] Watch yourself, Sibota.
I'm sorry.
[Dana] We are talking about a drug smuggler -here of the highest order. -Uh, community service?
Exhibit D!
[lawyer] Mr. Seal's planes are classified.
-[Dana] I am sick to fuck... -Sibota! ...of this Mickey Mouse tap-dancin' bullshit. -[Judge] I will hold you in contempt. -[Dana] Sorry. I'm very sorry.
So, I'm walking out of here? Now?
[Judge] State of Arkansas has spoken, Mr. Seal.
Do I have to go?
[Judge] Goodbye.
Hey, darlin'.
I do tend to leap before I look.
Maybe, uh... [clicks tongue]
Maybe I should have asked a few more questions.
Excuse me, uh, sir? Ma'am?
Would y'all mind moving out of the way? I'm just gonna start my car.
-Yeah. -[man] What?
I really appreciate that now.
[woman] Honey, just keep walking. Keep walking.
Thank you. Just startin' my car.
[man] Uh-huh. Appreciate it.
[Barry] I spent every day in a different motel.
Would y'all mind movin' outta the way there?
Thank you.
A different motel every day.
It's just for the safety of the children. Thank you.
But I had to show up to this Salvation Army halfway house
every evening at the same time.
Judge's orders.
You here for community service?
[Barry] Same time, same place.
-Uh, what's your name, sorry? -Louis.
Louis. Barry Seal. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Sign in for me.
[Barry] 120 days in a row.
There you go.
Hey, you may wanna move your truck, too.
Now, them Contras were damn excited about being in the U.S. of A.
[guard] Hey, Barry.
When are you gonna take me flying, man?
Thanks, Barry.
[Barry] Don't tell 'em I gave you that.
Day 36.
[Barry] You know, I guess you could say I helped build an army,
defend a country,
and create the biggest drug cartel this world's ever seen.
DEA, CIA, White House.
I mean, it's been a hell of an adventure.
Yeah, sometimes a little more than I bargained for. [chuckles]
But God damn! Now, you try telling me that this ain't the greatest country in the... -[gunshot] -[glass shatters]
We'll handle it from here, Deputy.
[announcer] Authorities believe last night's machine-gun killing of Barry Seal
was ordered by drug bosses in Medellín, Colombia.
Iran.
We get the Iranians to arm the Contras.
'Schafer' got a promotion.
After his release, Pete found God and became a preacher in rural Alabama.
The other pilots were never seen again.
The CIA continued to use Barry's plane to arm the Contras...
Shit! Come on, you big, fat bitch! Pull up!
...until one was shot down over Nicaragua.
The ensuing scandal was known as the Iran-Contra Affair.
[reporter] Mr. President, what do you know about money going to the Contras?
All I know is this is just gonna taste wonderful
All I know is this is just gonna taste wonderful and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
[reporter] Vice President Bush, did you know about the Contra aid or not, sir?
forbidden to foreigners.
A group of magical islands home to witches and demons.
A nation of rival provinces, whose lords were ruled by a shogun...
A nation of rival provinces, whose lords were ruled by a shogun... whose will is absolute.
Peace in the realm is kept by the samurai, master swordsmen...
tasked with protecting their lord and their province at all costs.
Should a samurai ever lose or fail his master,
he suffers the greatest shame in all Japanese society--
He becomes a ronin.
And yet, to know the story of the 47 Ronin...
is to know the story of all Japan.
It began with a boy.
No one knew where he came from or how he found his way to Ako.
Some said he was a changeling, no better than a beast.
Many believed he'd been raised by the tengu,
the demons of the forest,
who had taught him their dark powers...
and trained him in their lethal arts of killing.
The evil he had fled had left its mark upon him.
Oishi!
My lord, it is a demon.
He's a child,
He's a child, just like you.
Help me pick him up, Oishi.
[ Narrator ] Lord Asano of the province Ako saved him that day,
seeing something in the boy that Oishi did not.
Lord Asano's daughter, Mika, saw it too.
Mika's father allowed the boy to live amongst them...
against the advice of his samurai.
Look.
- What do you see? - A branch?
No.
It's a deer.
It took this path.
You keep it, Kai.
[ Narrator ] The samurai believed his presence would bring misfortune to their land.
Mika only saw a gentle boy.
Although he lived as an outcast,
Kai was determined to repay the love he received from Mika and her father,
whatever the cost.
[ Man ] Kai!
Well?
There is something wrong with the creature. It's up there on the rise.
There is something wrong with the creature. It's up there on the rise. But it will come down again to hunt.
It would be safer to set a trap and wait for it here.
It's up on the rise, Lord Asano.
- My lord. - Kill it!
I would rather have been killed by that beast...
than saved by a half-breed.
[ Man ] Yasuno!
Ako owes you a great debt, Yasuno.
We can finally welcome the shogun without fear.
For Ako!
[ All ] For Ako!
Well done.
Get out.
Get out!
Does Lord Asano live?
Yes.
[ Mika ] Hosting the shogun's tournament is a great honor for my father.
Everything must be perfect.
My lady-- Mika.
Lord Asano and the hunting party have returned.
They killed the beast.
Father.
I was worried.
The hunt took longer than we hoped.
Yasuno showed great courage.
Is anyone badly hurt?
Who are you looking for?
Is everything prepared for the shogun's arrival?
Yes, Father.
[ Asano ] I want all of Ako to share in this honor of hosting our great commander.
[ Mika ] I have made special arrangements for the visiting lords as well.
I've ordered stands put up all along the route.
Your mother would have been proud.
I was worried.
You always worry. [ Man Shouts ]
He so wants your approval.
Chikara has been training every chance he gets.
My lady, Kai has returned.
They told me you were hurt.
It's nothing, my lady.
Your back.
Sit down.
Someone should have seen to this before.
Thank you.
I saw the shame in Yasuno's eyes when they were praising him.
Even when you try to help them, they hate you.
Your father's samurai have always treated me as well as can be expected.
And is that all you expect?
It's all I know.
It doesn't have to be, Kai.
This is no place for you, my lady.
Are you sending me away?
Look at me and tell me you don't love me.
I will always love you.
But you have your place,
and I have mine.
Asano Takumi no Kami, ruler of Ako,
His Highness Shogun Tokugawa,
lord of provinces and master of all Japan,
thanks you for your welcome.
Lord Asano,
my friend,
Ako is magnificent... as always.
We anticipate with pleasure... tomorrow's tournament.
Father.
What are you doing in my home?
Last week at the hunt, I saw a fox.
I didn't realize at the time that it was a witch.
A witch?
I believe I saw the same creature again tonight.
She was in human form, among the nobles' concubines.
My lord.
They say only demons have the power to see past a witch's disguise.
Are you a demon?
No.
Then I suggest you are simply bewitched by a beautiful girl.
[ Man ] Lord Asano, may we present Lord Kira Yoshinaka,
master of Nagato, from the northern provinces.
Ako is as beautiful as I remember, Lord Asano.
We are honored by your visit, Lord Kira.
I look forward to the tournament.
I had no idea your concubine was so lovely, Lord Asano.
She's my daughter.
[ Chuckles ] Oh. Forgive me, my lady.
May I ask that your daughter sit with us?
I should like to make up for my rudeness.
Father, who is that?
My fighter.
I'm sure your father's champion will be an even contest.
Yasuno.
- [ Groaning ] - Yasuno.
Yasuno! Yasuno!
What's wrong with him?
Witchcraft. Get your father.
There is no time.
If we have no fighter, Ako will be disgraced.
Only a samurai can fight.
Enough.
Your fighter?
[ Man ] Champions, prepare for combat!
Bring them steel!
Stop!
You are not a samurai.
Kill it.
No!
No!
Forgive me, my lord.
The fault is mine.
Strip him of his armor. Beat him.
Stop!
I'm sorry.
[ Mika ] My lord!
Not now!
Father, please!
Lord Asano's mind is unsettled.
It is time to take Ako.
It is what you hoped for. It is what we have planned for.
What are you afraid of, my lord?
Show me your courage.
Give me your heart.
After this, there's no turning back.
You are bound to me... and I to you.
Rivers of blood...
and mountains of corpses...
will not stand in our way,
nor the tears of widows.
Find your envy and hatred,
and I will give you all you desire.
Father.
[ Screaming ] Father! [ Scream Echoes ] Help me!
Father!
Father! Mika. Father!
Father!
Mika.
Father!
Father!
Help! No!
My lord! Stop!
What is this?
Stay back!
My lord!
Please!
Father!
[ Man ] Everyone, go back to your posts.
The law is clear.
You have struck an unarmed guest and have shamed your home.
The penalty is death.
Because of your rank and the service you have done Ako,
I will allow you to regain your honor... and the honor of your house through seppuku.
and the honor of your house through seppuku.
Death by your own hand,
so that you may show courage and dignity in death...
as you once showed in life.
The shogun could have had me hanged like a criminal.
Instead he has allowed me...
to take my life... with honor.
You were bewitched, my lord.
Your mind was poisoned.
If I accept... my fate,
no one will question the honor of our people...
or punish them for my crime.
Promise me...
you will protect Mika and Ako from her enemies.
My lord!
I am ready, Oishi.
And when I die, I would be honored...
And when I die, I would be honored... if you would act as my second,
my friend.
Father!
Don't let them see you cry.
[ Man ] We must have revenge.
Whatever the cost, it is our duty.
My lord, what will you have us do?
If we fight now, we die.
And not just us.
Every farmer and villager in Ako will be killed.
We have to think of them first.
Poison, my lady. It will end your pain.
We have not lost Ako yet.
Your Highness.
Lady Asano.
I am sorry for your father's death.
He accepted it with dignity.
Your Highness,
as my father's only child,
I ask that I may look after his land until such time as I marry.
I have already considered this, my lady.
So that there will be no feud between your clans,
I decree... that from this day...
they will be one,
sealed by the marriage bond between you and Lord Kira.
You are granted one year to mourn,
but you will remain a guest of Lord Kira's until you are married.
Oishi.
You are now ronin,
masterless samurai.
I forbid you to seek vengeance for Lord Asano's death.
Lord Kira,
I leave Ako with you.
From this moment on,
you are banished from these lands.
Those who remain will be hunted down...
and executed.
You will never see him again, my lady.
Take a last look.
I don't trust Oishi. He no longer has the protection of his rank.
Throw him in the pit.
Break his will.
Father!
Father.
Get away! Get away from me!
Chikara, help him up.
Where are my men?
They have all left Ako.
And Lady Asano?
Her time of mourning is almost over.
Lord Kira took her to his castle... to begin preparing for their wedding.
Chikara.
What of the half-breed?
Kira's men took him to the Dutch island...
and sold him into slavery.
We need three horses.
Now.
Riku.
You must make the whole world believe you've divorced me.
It is the only way to protect you from what I have to do.
No one... but you and I can know that... you are and will always be...
you are and will always be...
the joy of my life.
I am the wife of a samurai.
Whatever your duty is, it is mine too.
Show them this,
and tell them to meet me at the Black Lake in a week.
Remember, the enemy will be watching.
[ Man ] Hey, stranger.
What's your business here?
I'm looking for a half-breed.
Good luck, samurai.
[ Crowd ] Half-breed! Half-breed! Half-breed! Half-breed!
Kai!
It's Oishi.
Kai!
It's me!
Kai!
Lady Asano-- Mika!
She needs your help.
[ Crowd ] Half-breed! Half-breed! Half-breed! Half-breed!
Kai, soon Kira will marry Mika.
We must stop him. Are you with me?
Lady Asano is to be married in a week.
What do you care?
When Kira took her away, you were on your knees.
We would have all been killed. You too.
What use are you to her dead?
What use am I to you?
Either follow me, or go back to what you were.
Don't turn your back on me, ronin. [ Sword Unsheathes ]
Follow you for what?
Kira has a thousand men under his command.
He's also... protected by witchcraft.
When I told you that, you turned me away. I was wrong.
I failed my lord.
I don't know who or what you are,
but I need your help.
Clothes.
I'll come with you,
but if you ever kneel before Kira again, I'll take your head.
Where did you learn to fight like that?
From demons.
My lord, forgive me.
The half-breed has escaped from the Dutch island.
They say a samurai helped him.
Oishi.
Find Oishi. I need him dead.
Hey! Yasuno, it's Oishi!
Hey!
He's back! Everyone, Oishi's back!
Oishi's back! Hey!
Father. Well done, Chikara.
[ Oishi ] Today we may be ronin,
but now the time has come.
What I propose... ends in death.
Even if we succeed,
we will be hanged... as criminals for defying the shogun's orders.
as criminals for defying the shogun's orders.
I take a vow before you...
that I will not rest until justice is done,
will not sleep until our master lies in peace...
and will not pray...
unless it is to ask the heavens' forgiveness...
for sending Kira to hell!
There are only two ways in--
the main gate here...
and this point beneath the west wall.
Both are heavily guarded.
Our best chance is to strike when Kira leaves the safety of his fortress.
He will travel to his ancestors' shrine to offer prayers.
We don't know yet when he will make the journey.
Isogai, you ride ahead to his temple town...
and see what you can find out.
Remember, even near holy sites...
there are brothels and plenty of loose-tongued officials who visit them.
Even if we know the route, we will need more men for an ambush.
Then we'll get them.
You and Chuzaemon and Okuda...
will gather as many of our former samurai as you can...
and meet us here at a farmhouse Horibe has found for us.
Forgive me, sir, but how can we succeed without good swords?
Take mine.
When we meet again, I'll have more waiting for you.
The rest of us will go to Uetsu.
The finest sword makers in the land work there.
Why is the half-breed here?
I asked him to come.
We can't take him with us. He's not a samurai.
None of us are samurai anymore.
Who are you?
We are farmers from Shimobe, sir.
We have come to buy tools.
This is Lord Kira's village now.
These are not farmer's hands.
Take the swords-- whatever you can salvage.
We'll need more.
Help him.
Eat, my lady.
You think I care if you starve?
Soon my lord will be ruler of all Japan,
and you can take your life like your father did.
You killed my father.
Weren't you the one who broke his heart?
You betrayed him with your lust.
We can go to Hida. They will give us weapons.
You will find nothing in Hida.
Kira's men will have taken over this entire region.
There is another way.
You will find swords in a sea of trees--
the tengu forest.
That is just a myth.
I've seen them.
How do you know about the tengu forest?
I was raised there, before I fled to Ako.
Those scars on your head--
are they the ones who marked you?
Yes.
And taught you to fight?
To kill.
They have many strange and magical ways to protect themselves and their beliefs.
They wanted to show me that this life has nothing to offer but death.
They wanted me to be like them and... renounce the world.
I vowed never to use the magical powers they taught me.
Although I was still a child,
I knew my place was among other men.
And you think that these tengu would give us weapons?
They will test our will.
[ Isogai ] My wife just won't stop nagging me.
She wants me to find her the best view of Lord Kira's procession.
Procession? What procession?
Nobody knows when Kira will leave his fortress, not even his own guards.
He'll hurry back before anyone is awake.
What is your name?
Yuki.
Where do you come from, Yuki?
[ Male Voice ] You've come back.
Are we lost?
No. They know we're here.
What is that noise?
[ Kai ] Ghosts. Spirits of the old and infirm who are left here to die.
Unwanted children too.
Only you.
I'm coming with you.
No.
Do as he says.
Stay here.
Whatever happens in there,
whatever you see,
don't draw your weapon.
Wait here.
[ Yasuno ] How do we know the half-breed hasn't led him into a trap?
Oishi trusts him.
Of course. He has no choice. We need weapons.
If he doesn't come back soon,
I'm going after him.
So the terrified boy returns as a man.
I have come for your help.
We are in need of swords.
Then take it.
These swords were forged to defend us against the hatred of men--
men who persecuted us for our beliefs.
The same men who despise you for being different.
And now you're here to help them.
They are good men. Their cause is just.
Many come for our steel.
But none return.
You told him not to draw his sword.
If he does,
he and all his men will die.
Was it worth it-- what you found in the outside world?
The love of a woman you can never have.
Yes.
Let me tell you of love, Kai--
the love of one night...
that brought you into this world.
An English sailor... and a peasant girl.
Your loving mother abandoned you to die in these woods.
A monster, a half-breed child.
Yet we found you,
accepted you, trained you.
We taught you many things.
But you fled,
and you turned your back on those gifts.
Gifts of death. No matter what you do,
Mika will never be yours in this life.
Then I will go to my death and pray I find her in the next.
[ Yasuno ] Sir.
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay.
No! Yasuno!
[ Tengu ] Draw your sword.
Save them.
Draw your sword.
- Save them. - [ Shouting ]
Draw your sword.
Save your men.
No more talk.
Will you give me what I ask?
Take the blade, Kai, if you can reach it before me.
Save your men. Help them!
Draw your sword, Oishi.
Save them.
Chikara!
A gift not forgotten.
[ Kai ] You passed their test.
Your men are safe.
You've got your swords.
What's so special about these swords?
What do they do?
Depends.
On what?
Who uses them.
What about a tall, strong,
brave man, like me?
They cut.
I think mine is broken.
Your sword. You keep it, Hazama. I told you we'd bring others.
I have the information you requested.
Lord Kira leaves for his ancestors' shrine tonight.
Well done.
Come, Isogai.
Gather the men.
[ Chikara ] Father.
- I want to go with you. - No.
Horibe, stay with him.
I ride to my ancestors' shrine... to offer thanks for our wedding.
Is there anything you wish me to pray for?
My lord will not like my answer.
You may look down on me, my lady,
but our children, and their children, will be of one blood.
Take care, Hazama.
Sorry.
It's a trap! Go! Go!
It's a trap! Get back!
- [ All Shouting ] - Get out!
Yasuno!
Yasuno!
Oishi, help me. It's Basho.
Hazama!
No! Oishi!
It belonged to Oishi, my lord.
Your half-breed... is dead.
So are dozens of your father's men.
All killed...
trying to save you.
Perhaps now... you understand...
the price of your love.
I promised my lord...
I would not harm...
a hair on your head.
But... what you do to yourself...
is not my concern.
Good night.
Kai.
I have a confession to make.
When I was a boy,
I used to wait in the woods outside your hut,
and when you came out,
I'd throw stones at you,
then hide.
I knew it was you.
I could see your belly sticking out from behind the trees.
I'm sorry, Kai.
You are a good man.
I should have acted the day Lord Asano died.
Our anger should have been sudden and swift.
Then even if we'd failed,
it would have been with honor.
You are a samurai.
We still have swords and the advantage of surprise.
Kira thinks we're ghosts.
We can use that, turn it to our advantage.
He'll never expect us.
We can still do what we came for.
Eat.
Your arm? Fine.
Go get your father.
[ Man ] Stay where you are!
What is this?
We are not some village troupe to be held up by bandits.
Lord Kira himself has hired us to perform at his wedding.
I have the letters and passes to prove it.
There is no need.
We saw you perform in Ako.
You are Lord Asano's men.
We need your help.
Kai.
Forgive me for not thanking you for defeating the beast...
and saving my life.
A samurai does not take credit for victories of others.
This belonged to Basho.
A samurai wears two swords.
[ Oishi ] When a crime goes unpunished,
the world is unbalanced.
When a wrong is unavenged,
the heavens look down on us in shame.
We, too, must die for this circle of vengeance to be closed.
We will leave this record of our courage...
so the world will know who we were and what we did.
Tonight, we will regain our honor...
and avenge our lord.
None of us knows how long he shall live...
or when his time will come.
But soon... all that will be left of our brief lives...
is the pride our children feel... when they speak our names.
Kai.
We end this now.
Now...
we are 47.
What do you see?
The omens are good.
Soon you will travel far.
In every town and village, people shall bow before you.
[ Man ] Halt!
Let them through.
[ Man ] Five minutes!
Lord Kira,
we are proud to present to you...
our performance as a gift for your wedding.
[ Oishi ] Don't hurt the princess!
[ Whimpers ] Kai!
Get them!
Stay there!
I knew you'd come for me.
Nothing will ever keep me away from you.
Nothing, half-breed?
Even death?
I know what you are.
You have no idea.
I'm not afraid of you.
You should be.
Come on.
Know now... the depth of my lord's courage.
In the name of Lord Asano of Ako--
For Lord Asano!
Chikara.
Rest now, my lord.
You are avenged.
[ Shogun ] Oishi.
I gave you a command forbidding you to take revenge.
Forgive me, Your Highness,
but a man may not live under the same heaven...
as the murderer of his lord.
All I ask is respect for my men.
They are brave, my lord.
The bravest I know.
I beg you to let them die...
with the dignity they deserve.
For the crime of disobedience,
you should all be executed as common criminals,
but you and your men...
followed the old ways of Bushido--
to honor your lord and to avenge treachery.
I see only samurai before me.
I grant you a samurai's death...
to be buried alongside your lord...
with honor.
Thank you, Your Highness.
Lady Asano is like her father.
She will make Ako great again.
Yes.
I know.
My father told me...
this world was only a preparation for the next--
that all we can ask is that we leave it... having loved and being loved.
having loved and being loved.
I will search for you through a thousand worlds...
and 10,000 lifetimes until I find you.
I will wait for you in all of them.
Wait!
Chikara,
son of Oishi,
step out.
Oishi,
I will not deny our country your bloodline.
Your son shall live...
to serve Ako...
as you and your samurai have done.
[ Kai's Voice ] I will search for you... through a thousand worlds...
and 10,000 lifetimes...
until I find you.

They're gonna walk out of here without even a slap on the wrist.
Mommy and Daddy are too hooked up.
But I like screw-ups like you.
You know why? 'Cause you're 100 percent guaranteed conviction.
-Where's my car? -I crushed it.
You did what?
-Sit down! -Easy. Easy. You're done. You understand me?
You're done. You understand me?
You're done. And all before your 18th birthday. Now sit down. ( knocking)
Sean.
What the hell were you thinkin', huh?
Mrs. Boswell? Please.
It's--it's Miss.
Officer, is it illegal to smoke in here?
It's a tough state. And it's a pretty clear-cut case.
He'll be lucky if they don't try him as an adult.
This is our third town in two years.
Your son's got two priors for reckless driving, willful destruction of property.
This makes it strike three.
They're definitely gonna want to get him off the streets.
Well, there's just got to be another way.
So, where are we moving this time?
We are not moving anywhere.
Sean.
I thought you were gonna be here on the 7th.
Today is the 7th.
Well, look, just hold on one second.
Come on in.
This is it.
You know, Sean, I was-- I was gonna be there.
But your mom, she said the 7th, see,
and we're a day ahead of you in Japan.
Well, you're here now, and that's good.
So, how is your mom?
Where do I sleep?
Now, Sean, you know she had no other choice.
I mean, it was either this or juvie hall, I mean, you just can't keep moving away
I mean, you just can't keep moving away every time you get into trouble.
Worked for you.
Look, neither of us asked for this.
But I promised your mom I'd take care of you.
So you just go by the rules her and I agreed to, and I'm sure you'll manage just fine.
and I'm sure you'll manage just fine. Rules?
Yeah, rules. Real simple.
You go to school, you come back here right after.
And I don't want to see or hear about you anywhere near a car.
Here, the bedroom is yours.

Yeah?
I'll hook you up. Half price.
No, I'm cool. 60 percent off. Hmm?
60 percent off. Hmm? Since we're both army brats and everything.
I ain't got no cash, man.
And I ain't an army brat.
All right, all right. Well, what about a cell phone, huh?
Everybody needs a cell phone.
No offense, but I'm probably not gonna be here
No offense, but I'm probably not gonna be here long enough to remember your name.
Then you gonna need some new shoes to book town with, man.
You like Michael Jordan? I love Michael Jordan.
Check this out.
Brand new Jordans. Not even out yet.
LeBron James couldn't even get his hands on those.
You selling that Sparco steering wheel?
Hell, no. That's mine right there.
Man, I even paid retail for it.
What you drive?
Oh, my ride? -Yeah. -Yeah. My ride's one of a kind.
-Yeah. -Yeah. My ride's one of a kind. Show me.
Thought you weren't stickin' around.
All right.
Slamming, huh? Look at that car.
At least let me drive.
Y'all better have some real cars around here.
Okay. I see somebody got jokes, huh? Well, all right.
I don't know if you're ready for them, though. You look a little nervous.
You look a little nervous. What up, Tosh?
What up, Tosh?
For when you blow your wad, man.
Hear that?
It's still not right for the way I drive.
I don't need a computer to tell me about my throttle response.
Okay. Then we're done here.
You wouldn't have that problem with a V8.
Boys.
All they care about is who's got the biggest engine.
I'm a guy. It's in my DNA.
So y'all race with these things, huh? Cute little toys.
You know, I almost didn't recognize you without your slippers on.
Don't you mean wabaki?
Neela, right?
You're a quick learner.
So, where you from, anyway?
Here.
No. I mean, not where you live. Where'd you come from?
Does it really matter where I'm from?
Who's the tourist?
What's with you and the schoolgirls, D?
You're moving up in the world. You gotta elevate your company.
Wednesday, Wednesday, meet Thursday. God. Girl.
Ladies, hold that thought, all right? All right, beautiful. Hold up.
He was just leaving. ( speaking Japanese )
I'm sorry. I don't speak Japanese.
Understand that? Gaijin?
Takashi.
We were just talking.
This isn't your scene.
That word you called me, gaijin or something or other,
what does that mean exactly?
Means, turn around, keep walking.
That's exactly what we gonna do. Come on, man, let's roll.
Yo, look, man, he's Yakuza.
Now, see, that's funny,
'cause I thought this was, like, a free country
Where a girl could talk to whoever she wants.
You know who I am, boy?
Yeah. You're like the Justin Timberlake of Japan, right? ( chuckles )
Leave.
Damn, man. You know Yakuza? The Mafia?
Look, sorry, DK-san. Monkey didn't have his banana today.
Hey, D, let's go. It's time to race.
Hey, good luck, Timberlake.
You're the one that's lucky, 'cause I'm about to race.
Then let's race. ( chuckles )
With what, huh? Your skateboard?
Easy to sound cocky when you got no ride.
Take mine.
Let's race.
What? I wanna see what the kid's got.
Can he drive?
Can he drive?
You know what DK stands for?
Donkey Kong?
Drift King.
Drift?
What do you mean, drift?
Still need a dictionary?
You know that real famous painting?
The one of the woman who's smiling all the time? The Mona Lisa.
Right, right, right, right. Mona Lisa.
Well, look, man, this car right here's like the Mona Lisa of the drift world.
Han rebuilt this bad boy from ground up. We talking forged pistons,
We talking forged pistons, bigger turbo, new rods, new crankshaft.
Hey, man, Han's labor ain't cheap, man, you feel me?
Well, if I needed a 30-second lesson on how to drift--
All right, look, man. There's lots of ways you can do this, all right?
Hand braking is the easiest, so the first thing I want you
to do, I want you to rip that e-brake. All right?
All right? After you rip the e-brake, then I want you to power over.
You know what? Just don't mess up Mona, all right?
All right.
Ready.
Set.
Go!
♪ Cause I can see the sun ♪ I told you.
Damn it!
Damn it!
Don't leave town.
Do you know what time it is?
I thought it was around 7 o'clock.
You know, U.S. is a few hours behind.
Looks like the party was better here, anyway.
Have you been racing, Sean?
You're out of here.
Go ahead.
You don't get it, do you?
You have nowhere else to go.
If it doesn't work out here, you're going to jail. Do you get that?
This isn't a game. And I'm gonna tell you one more time,
if you're gonna live under my roof, you're gonna go by my rules or get out.
Understand?
Understand?
Yes, sir.
Get in.
I'll get you your money.
Why you talking like you have a choice?
There's a guy in there with a paw that owes me some money.
A paw?
Go get me my money.
Okay.
Han said, um...
okane.
Han said okane.
Let's go.
You're in the pickup and delivery business now.
I might call you once a week or once an hour.
I don't care if you're sick as a dog or in bed with Beyoncé.
I call, you show.
Only if you teach me how to drift. This ain't a negotiation.
I wasn't negotiating.
What's he doing here?
He's paying me back for that crumpled beer can sitting in my garage.
Hope he's not driving.
Gaijin.
When is your next race? I'd really like to be there.
Why not be in it?
You heard me.
Ready to lose another car, Han?
I'm ready to take that '86 Corolla off your hands.
All right.
Put up the '72 Skyline.
Done.
What do you think, Morimoto, huh?
Get him out of here.
We have business to discuss.
Your shipment's late.
Since when are you so worried about the details?
When is the shipment arriving, Han?
Just sit pretty and let me handle it.
Hey, Dad, it's me.
I had to stay after school for some extracurricular activities.
So I'll be home a little later.
Sir.
You really need to stop following me around.
What are you doing here?
I thought I'd stop by and ask your boyfriend for some drifting lessons.
Trust me. You don't wanna be a part of this world.
It's good enough for you.
You don't know anything about me.
Well, why don't you think I know?
'Cause I'm a gaijin? An outsider?
Let me guess.
You're an army brat who moved around a lot.
Your mama and daddy was never home.
So you walked around pissed off all the time
and now you found your family with these drift nuts.
Zero for one, cowboy.
Why can't you go find a nice Japanese girl
like the rest of the white guys around here?
Is everything okay back there?
I can handle DK.
I thought he's Yakuza.
His uncle's Yakuza.
He's just playing gangster in his little storage room.
But I need him.
He keeps Uncle Kamata from poking around too much.
What do you mean?
Well, his uncle gets a piece of the action from everyone on his turf.
We're on his turf.
50 percent of something is better than 100 percent of nothing.
So have you raced DK?
Why not? Is he that good?
What's the point of a race?
To see if I'm better than the other guy.
Just proves you're faster, that's all.
If I were to race, it would have to be for something important. Or why else do it at all?
Or why else do it at all?
Why are you letting me race?
'Cause you're DK's kryptonite.
And you owe me a car.
Oh, shit.
What the--
Police cars here are only factory-tuned.
You can do better than 180k, they can't catch you,
so they don't even try.
You know what? I'm beginning to like this country already.
Danny!
Oh, you're looking good. Hey.
( Japanese music playing ) Disco.
We gotta catch up. Get you a drink on me, huh?
Let's go.
Uh-oh. Easy now, ladies.
Come on.
Hey! What's up? How you doing?
Hey, baby.
Keep your hands off the kid, girls. He's underage.
Ladies, ladies, ladies. Disneyland for grownups, huh?
All these girls, man, they look like-- What, models? Check it out.
What, models? Check it out.
See, Tokyo is the fashion capital on this side of the planet, all right? Now, imagine you been posing all day.
Now, imagine you been posing all day. I mean, that's a lot of hard work. Not only do you get tired, but, on top of that,
Not only do you get tired, but, on top of that, you wanna have a little fun, but you can't
you wanna have a little fun, but you can't 'cause you don't even know nobody in town. And most of the guys around here are too chicken shit to even try picking up one.

Han, where did you find this guy?
Will someone please teach this guy how to drift?
Is that yours?
Sure is.
What happened?
I don't know. I found it this way at the base.
It's got potential.
Yeah, maybe. We'll see.
You know, Sean, the Japanese have a saying.
The nail that sticks out gets hammered.
You're gonna be late.

Come on, man, you broke it.
Hey, whoa, whoa.
There must be a misunderstanding.
Out of my way, or you're next.

Okay, let's go, then!
Let's go!

Try not to break this one.

Now everybody's gonna want exchanges around here.
Damn!

So, how did you end up over here, anyway?
Well, you know those old Westerns where the cowboys make a run for the border?
where the cowboys make a run for the border?
This is my Mexico.
Why'd you let me race with your car?
You knew I was gonna wreck it.
Why not?
'Cause it's a lot of money.
I have money.
It's trust and character I need around me.
You know, who you choose to be around you lets you know who you are.
And one car in exchange for knowing what a man's made of,
that's a price I can live with.
Look at all those people down there.
They follow the rules, for what?
They're letting fear lead them.
What happens if they don't?
Life's simple. You make choices and you don't look back.
So, if you don't drift to win, what do you drift for?
You really want to know? Yeah.
Okay. Let's go.
There's no "wax on, wax off" with drifting.
Learn by doin' it.
The first drifters invented drifting out here in the mountains by feeling it.
So feel it.
Again!
What's in this bag? You'll see.
How much you got? Keep going, keep going.

Hey, Twink. Get this man a bunk.
Pleasure doing business.
Yeah, baby. I told you. I told you, didn't I?
It's actually not bad. I didn't even have to put ketchup on it.
See, I'm not a total gaijin.
I hate that word.
It's what they used to call me when I was a kid.
I thought you were born here.
Well, "outsider" can mean many different things.
My mom died when I was 10.
She came out here from Australia when she finished high school.
And all I know about her is that she went to work in a hostess bar.
DK's grandmother took me in.
Well, my parents split up when I was three.
Me and Mom moved around a lot. Mostly 'cause of me.
Well, it was all 'cause of me.
Kind of made myself an outsider,
you know, without even thinking about it.
But I realize now, outsider or insider, it doesn't really matter.
All that matters is knowing what you really want and going after it.
We used to come up here when we were kids. Even before we could drive we'd cut class, sneak out,
Even before we could drive we'd cut class, sneak out,
come up here, and watch the older kids drift.
Things were different back then.
Once I got my license, I practically lived up here.
Back then, kids just drove whatever they had.
You know, we just made do. No one bothered us.
The day I got my license is the day I got my first speeding ticket.
The day after that, I won my first race.
I beat this rich kid by three lengths.
I gotta admit, it felt good.
It felt like--
Like everything else just disappears.
No past and no future. No problems.
Just the moment.
Boy needs to chill.
Hey, Twink, I'm gonna grab another set.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Another set? No. Look, that was your third set today. I mean, them tires ain't cheap.
DK, grab a chair. We're about to roast some marshmallows.
Yo, come on, man, look--
Stay away from her, or the only thing you'll be driving is a wheelchair.
Find yourself a new driver. ( spits )
I'm all right. What'd you expect?
You didn't just play with fire, you soaked the matches in gasoline.
It's over.
All this over a gaijin? I am a gaijin.
You've changed, DK.
You say I've changed.
But we're not so different, you and I.
We're both products of fuckups, aren't we?
They say your mom was the best trick
in all of Kabukicho back in the day.
Leave my mother out of this.
If we hadn't taken you in, you'd be just like her,
doing anything for a buck.
Think anyone would take a second look at you if it wasn't for your uncle?
We're the same, Neela.
Difference is I know who I am and where I belong.
Do you know who you are?
Do you know where you belong?
Hey.
Come on.
Hey, brother.
I vouched for you! Put my reputation on the line for you!
We were partners!
You think you can keep your side deals from me?
Come on. We ain't in the Boy Scouts.
This is what we do. Takashi!
What about now?
Hmm? Is this what we do?
Man, you need me.
You'd still be shaking down teahouses for chump change if it wasn't for me.
Get in! Go! Go! Go!
Come on.
( honking )
Sean. Sean!
Takashi.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Okay.
I'll go with you.
Neela.
See you when Daddy's not around.
I'm putting you on a plane tonight. -Dad-- -Sean, don't argue with me.
-Dad-- -Sean, don't argue with me.
I did this. I can't run away.
I can't.
Sean, I'm your father. I'm responsible for your well-being.
And I'm responsible for my mess.
I gotta do this.
Can you understand that?
At least you're not redoing my mistakes.
You all right, man?
We're leaving town. Look, I know some people--
I can't do it, Twink.
Look, DK wants your head. All right?
And the trouble you just made for Kamata? You're done here, bro.
Maybe I should talk to Kamata. What?
DK answers to him.
I know I just didn't hear that.
I gotta end this. I'm gonna go talk to him.
What, are you crazy, huh?
Han is dead, all right!
Plus, you can't just walk into Kamata's place, man!
It's all I got.
Something I think Han would've wanted you to have.
What's this?
You're gonna need it if you're gonna make it out of Kamata's place alive.
Don't you need it?
No, it's cool. Look, I'll figure it out.
Sean.
You need to leave.
You came to the wrong place.
I didn't come here to see you.
Takashi.
You think you can walk in here,
You think you can walk in here, dump some cash and walk out?
I know I'm only returning what belonged to you in the first place, sir.
But that's not why I really came.
I came here to apologize.
I know your nephew and I have embarrassed ourselves badly.
Sir, I'm here to offer you a peaceful solution.
How do you plan to accomplish that?
A race.
DK and I have caused nothing but problems for you, for us.
And I'm asking you to allow us to settle this, once and for all.
We race
and the loser leaves town for good.
I've already beat this piece of shit once!
Good.
Then it should be easy.
The cops took all the cars.
Hey!
That's why she's spitting.
We almost there, Twink. Couple more tweaks.
It's not the car I'm worried about, man.
DK picked this road for a reason. This is his mountain.
He's the only one to ever make it to the bottom.
Yeah!
-Yeah! -Yeah! Yes!
( grunts )
-Yeah! -Come on!
-Woo! -Come on, Sean.
Sean's the boss. Let's go.
Damn! Come on, man! That ain't right.
Yeah, baby! That's what I'm talking about, man.
That's what I'm talking about, man. I told you!
Hey, yo, Sean! Yo, Sean!
Hey, check this out, man.
This dude over here wanna race the new DK.
Heard he's been beating everybody around Asia, too.
Not tonight, Twinkie.
Said he knew Han.
Said Han was family.
All right. Let's race.
Nice ride.
I won it from our friend Han a few years ago.
I didn't know he was into American muscle.
He was when he was rolling with me.
You know this ain't no 10-second race.
I got nothing but time.
You ready, kid?
Come on, Sean! Come on!
Ready!

The Heart has a chance of success at just 32 percent.
Not helping, Jack.
Um… Stone, big drop coming up.
Big drop.
-How big? -[Jack] The mother of big.
Really, really big.
And we're in the game.
Look, I've got money.
More than you can imagine.
It wouldn't be enough.
Eight minutes out. We're not gonna make it.
Stone, Mulvaney's security are arriving at the cable car station.
Take the route to your left. You need to pick up the pace.
The terrain's too flat, and you're losing altitude.
If you cut across to the piste, you can pick up a snow bike.
Cables! Cables! Cables! Ca--
Chance of success just plummeted.
Only 'cause you've got no imagination.
Oh, nice. Nice.
[Bailey] Oh, you're joking!
Come on!
He can hold them off without us, right?
Hold on!
[Jack] You can get ahead of the bikes at the next corner.
[man] Hey. Are you okay?
We meet again.
Must be destiny.
Must be.
[man] Hey.
Hey! Hey!
Stone, watch Bailey and Yang to your right.
The Charter's worked too hard to embed you in MI6.
We cannot risk your cover.
Well aware, Jack.
How many in the welcome party?
[Jack] Six of them.
Four pistols, one shotgun, and a sniper
with a very impressive record.
Get out of the way!
[Jack] Get away from them. Take the path to your right.
The sniper has opened fire on Parker.
[Stone] Jack, give me a line.
I got the lights.
[Jack] Behind you!
Chance of success to 85%.
Only 85%?
Hardly seems fair.
Uh… two more on your right.
[Stone] Look at that.
Parker and target still very much alive.
[exhales] Great.
Now, hide the bodies and get out before MI6 sees you.
Okay.
What's happening?
-Yang. -Hey.
Where'd they go?
Where'd who go?
Mulvaney had an army of security.
[Parker] Got scared off by the sirens maybe?
No point waiting to find out. Let's just grab him and go.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! He's foaming. -Shit.
[Bailey] Bastard took cyanide.
[Yang] That's old school.
Shit.
Jesus. He's dead.
Grab a leg. We have to get back up the mountain for Stone.
All right, genius. Now what? ♪ What you don't know cannot ♪
♪ For myself 'Cause I've been quiet way too long ♪
♪ Believe me, all I want is you ♪ ♪ For myself 'Cause I've been quiet way too long ♪
Genuine dog's breakfast.
The Italians are livid, as are Defense and Number 10.
-I take full responsibility. -[man] "I." That's your problem, Parker.
Mulvaney's dead.
Yang gave the wrong person a heart attack.
And Stone, what the hell were you thinking getting out of the van?
-That was the only way she could get-- -[man] Put it in the report.
Paperwork. Excellent. That'll show Mulvaney's lads who's boss.
[man] Enough.
Mulvaney's gone. And so is any hope of using him as an asset.
But now we have a new target.
Someone broke through the highest levels of military encryption, including our own.
-Did you look into the girl? -[man] The girl?
Oh, yes. I'm afraid we'll need more than that.
We are trying to trace her, but so far, we have nothing.
-I'm happy to look-- -[man] We have people for that.
Different people.
You can all concentrate on your admin. Sandra.
[Parker] Cheers, Sandra.
Thanks, Sandra.
Love you, Sandra.
[Bailey] To Stone.
-First time out of the van. -[all] Hey!
-[Bailey] And she didn't blow the op-- -[Yang] No, we did that all on our own.
Too bad. Been on a good winning streak since Stone joined us.
Thought you might be our lucky charm. But you did win at blackjack.
And I'm never gambling again or stepping out of the van.
What'd you do when I left you up there?
[inhales] Hid in the toilets.
-What? You said to stay out of sight. -True.
All right. Leave her alone.
We got more important things to discuss.
Like, the girl.
But let's be honest. We already know who she works for.
-[sighs] God. -That's right. The Charter.
-Strap yourselves in. -[Yang laughs]
Whatever. I just identified another one of their ops.
They took out a terror cell who hijacked an oil tanker in the Panama Canal.
Yeah, but who would have that kind of power?
-I'm doing it again, aren't I? -Yeah.
Okay, fine, mock me.
But it's true.
Ex-intelligence operatives answering only to themselves.
No national allegiances, no political leanings.
Putting out fires their governments never allowed them to. That's…
That's the Charter.
The most highly trained agents
working together to keep peace in a turbulent world.
No. That is a Saturday morning cartoon.
Nobody knows about the Charter because they don't exist.
Pass me the vinegar.
-And this girl. -[laughs]
This girl is part of it, and you know it.
Okay, don't judge me. I'm gonna go with this for a sec.
-If the Charter are such do-gooders… -Mm.
…why'd the girl interrupt our mission?
That's a good question. Yep.
Sorry, Bailey, there is no secret genius organization pulling all the strings.
It's just us, Sandra, and her paperwork.
But it was a nice bedtime story. Speaking of which…
Already?
-Jet lag. -Um, there's a one-hour time difference.
Night, guys.
-Night. -Night.
[laughs] Right in the eye.
-I drive with that eye. -Might make you a better driver.
[Yang] Can't make you worse.
-Kidding. I take it back. -[Parker] No.
Sneaking up on me?
A field agent should be ready for anything.
You were saying? I never should have told you I swim.
A weak moment.
I liked it.
So… the girl.
What news?
No news. We were told not to look.
You're a terrible liar.
Look, if we leave it to the pen-pushers at MI6,
she'll hack the entire world before we even get a name.
I should've gone beyond the mission and brought her in.
Well, your hands were pretty full at the time.
And besides, it wasn't our objective.
Why don't you try and live a little? Could be fun.
What happened to "Don't get out of the van, Rachel"? Ah.
-This is different. -Hm.
So, rules are rules unless they apply to you.
Why do I feel like you know me better than I know you?
Maybe I should listen to one of these dreary podcasts of yours. -♪ Don't stop thinking about tomorrow… ♪ -Ah.
Bailey got to you, huh?
Mock our music, and I won't tell you my theory.
My lips are sealed.
She's new to the scene. Has to be.
Otherwise, we would have heard about her.
To get a guest list like that--
She's working with someone else. A veteran. But who?
We'll make a list. I'll bring snacks.
I, uh, I'm sorry. I already have… a brunch date.
Can I come?
Bye, Parker.
[Stone] Ivo? It's been a while.
Nine of Hearts, it's good to see you.
-How's it going? -It's been busy. This way.
The Charter has been dealing with three actionable threats this morning.
Potential sarin gas attack in Paris.
The Heart predicted the time and location of the attack with 87% certainty.
Eight of Hearts is on site now.
Six is defusing a potential international incident
in the South China Sea.
And Diamonds team's handling hackers targeting the North American power grid.
That, um… That's the peacock.
-Hi. -Came with the house.
-[peafowl caws] -[Stone] Hey, Jack. Enjoying your new office?
We can't all be gallivanting around the Alps.
How's King of Hearts? Is she angry?
Have you seen her yet?
Well, let's see. You lost control of the situation, target is dead,
Well, let's see. You lost control of the situation, target is dead, then you had to kill six men.
What a glorious outcome. -Victoria Crosses all around. -[Stone] Morning, Nomad.
-Victoria Crosses all around. -[Stone] Morning, Nomad.
Good to see you too. Love what you've done with the place.
Is she developing a sense of humor?
-Did you find the girl? -Of course.
Keya Dhawan.
She is from Pune in the west of India.
Orphaned at eight.
[Stone] How'd she learn to program?
Ever heard of Niam Kharche?
Billionaire investor, pharmaceuticals.
Had business in Pune.
Ran IT workshops for kids in underprivileged communities.
[Stone] He spotted her in one of these programs.
Yeah. He saw she was a prodigy, took her under his wing, trained her up,
and then they had a falling out.
Why?
[Nomad] The Heart's better at whats than whys.
And the what is, she split from Kharche and disappeared.
She's 22 now.
Not much older than when we met.
[Nomad] Yes, but she fell in with a bunch of criminal lowlifes.
Some people get all the luck.
We think that Keya set up the casino of blood.
She knew about Mulvaney's gambling habit and used it to lure him in.
Why?
Mulvaney had become obsessed with a new weapon, a myth.
A quantum computer sophisticated enough to hack into anything, anywhere.
The Heart.
So, where is she now?
The Heart predicts with 96% certainty
that Keya is heading to Lisbon for the opening of Club Moritz.
So, we will leak her location to MI6.
Then we should have your operation back up and running within 24 hours.
It doesn't feel right.
Keya chose to hack into our comms feed on the mountain.
She revealed herself to me, looked me straight in the eye.
I'm not sure if we should ignore the Heart,
the closest mankind has to perfect intelligence,
because of eye contact in a bar.
This might be why you're single, Jack.
Just follow the numbers.
Your mission is Lisbon.
And if she's not there?
Eat tapas.
Just not with your MI6 team.
So, you're spying on me now.
I'm tracking my asset.
You know what you signed up for.
No relationships. No friends.
No poolside tête-à-tête.
What we do is too important.
When governments fail, the only thing left is the Charter.
I'm undercover. This is just part of it.
-Everything's under control. -Good.
Keep it that way.
Your target is Dhawan.
Come on, Keya. Take the bait.
Smile.
Hey, Bailey.
[Bailey] Hey. We got a lead on hacker girl.
We're going to Lisbon.
Better call the cat sitter.
Oh no, no. Barry's all right. He's--
I told him, no parties.
Okay. Sweet dreams.
Wheels up at eight.
Got it.
-Night, Bailey. -Night.
[Bailey laughs] What about this?
[Parker] Ah Jesus. Just when we thought it couldn't get worse.
-[Bailey] Are you singing? -[Parker] I'm clearing my throat.
Tune.
-[Stone] Look at that. -[Parker] No.
Voice of an angel.
♪ I want to be with you everywhere ♪ ♪ Oh, I ♪
Bailey, you should meet my gran. She has the same taste in music,
and you have the same hair.
It's my van, my tunes.
Yeah, that's what she says.
-[Bailey] Oh, sorry. -[Parker] Whoa.
-[Bailey] Oh, sorry. -[Parker] Whoa. Little harder next time. I didn't quite crack a tooth.
Little harder next time. I didn't quite crack a tooth.
[Yang] You okay back there?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just, uh…
-[Yang] Carsick. -Mm.
-[Parker] It's Bailey's music. -[laughing]
Come on, swap seats with me.
-What? No, no, no. It's fine. -Come on. No, it's fine. Move.
-Okay. -[seat belt unlocks]
-[Stone] Jesus! -[Bailey] Seatbelt.
[Yang] Bailey!
[Parker] Aren't you supposed to be an elite driver?
Sorry.
-[Bailey] Okay? -Yeah.
[Yang] How long till the club opens?
[Bailey] We head out in a couple of hours.
[Bailey] Hey, Stone.
Sent you something. Check it out.
-What is this? -It's for my niece's birthday.
What do you think? Female perspective?
It's very pink. [chuckles softly]
[Yang] Parker, this music is ancient.
-What are you, a hundred years old? -It's called culture.
Yeah. Sorry, Parker, I'm with Yang. Yang!
[Yang] Yes!
-Woo! -Oh, okay.
[Yang] Now we're talking.
Oh, come on, Bailey. You know you want to.
Yes, I do.
[Bailey] Stone?
-Oh yeah. -[Bailey] Stone, come on.
[Bailey] You know you want to. Come on.
[Yang] Yeah.
Oh no you don't.
Watch out, you might actually enjoy yourself.
-She's smiling. -[Yang] Oh yeah!
[man] Six hostiles entering the building…
Nine, I have you.
Six hostiles moving up the stairs. More outside.
They'll breach the doorway in four…
three…
two…
one.
[Bailey] Parker.
We're gonna get you out.
Stone, go now!
Nine, the window.
Get out. Now.
Stone, you will die.
Jack, I need your help.
Plotting exit routes… now.
Come on. Parker, come on. Come on!
I'm going back in.
What? No.
Saving them is not your mission.
-Get out of there. -Jack, please.
No. At best, you break cover. Most likely, you die.
Stone?
Stone?
Stone!
-Holy shit. -Come on.
Time to go.
There'll be more. Come on.
Van's a no-go. Go, go.
Does that thing ever work?
Yeah, yeah. It works. Just not on every car.
There. Move!
Stone. Now would be good.
Move over. I've got this.
-Away from the guns, Stone. Away! -Just a second.
Down! Down! Down!
Go! Go, go, go, go!
Okay, Stone. Time to start talking.
You hack, you fight, and you drive. Parker, are you getting this?
-Three vehicles. Lots of guns. -Yeah, I can tell by the bullets.
-Stone! -Sort of in the middle of something.
Brakes, brakes, brakes!
Oh, okay. Okay, you got it.
Yang.
-Got it. -On your three o'clock.
In three, two, one.
Clip's out.
-Are you trying to kill us? -Pretty much the opposite, actually.
Okay. This might be kind of intense.
Oh, this isn't good.
-Stone, they're still coming. -I know.
Hold on.
Well, I can't speak for the others, but I… I think you're ready for the field.
We need to get off the road and lose this van.
[Yang] Rachel.
Rachel.
Stone.
Who the hell are you?
It's complicated.
-[sighs] -From where I'm sitting,
a baby agent from IT just took out an entire kill team.
-Bailey, what's taking you so long? -Shit.
The Charter? You're the… you're the bloody Charter?
What, are you trying to bring in Dhawan yourself?
Are you working with her?
[Yang] Answer him.
You owe us that.
We're after her too.
Oh my God.
The Charter's real.
And you're one of them.
I wish I could've told you more.
But we all want the same thing.
No, we don't.
You're not the only one with a secret.
Did they mean something to you?
Oh, come on, Rachel. You're only playing a part, right?
Who are you, Parker?
Why don't you ask the Heart?
If you wanted me dead, you would have shot me first.
[exhales] Still a few things I need to know.
About you, the Charter.
But perhaps most of all,
I was looking forward to a fight.
-[groans] -Talk.
Keya and I learned that the Charter infiltrated MI6.
I had to flush out who.
At first, I thought it was Yang,
but I was so pleased it was you.
Keya's working for you?
Your hand's shaking.
You barely nicked me.
That was the point.
Poison-tipped.
A little basic, I know, but it hits the spot.
Looks like the paralysis is kicking in.
I spent six years looking for you people, Stone.
Then fate brings you straight to me.
You're a very good agent.
But you were so busy letting a machine think for you that you missed me.
Right here,
in front of your face…
the whole time.
And Mulvaney?
Well, he was tech-averse like me.
Kept everything up here.
So, Keya and I set up our casino of blood to lure him in.
We needed to have a little chat about the Heart.
All right. Okay, okay, okay.
[Parker] Talk.
Yeah, I--
The Heart is what gives the Charter its power.
It's the most formidable weapon you never knew existed.
It can hack into anything, anywhere.
Cell phones, power grids, the banks, governments, military, health records.
Your secrets.
It knows you better than you know yourself.
It's determinism.
With access to trillions of data points at once, its modeling is so accurate
it can predict the future.
The Heart is knowledge and power.
It can crash a market or drop a plane out of the sky.
Who needs to steal a nuclear bomb when you can control them all?
If you own the Heart…
you own the world.
Where is it?
Where… is it?
Only a Charter member could tell you.
The poison's a cholinesterase inhibitor.
Cold War paralytic.
My chemist does all the classics.
Like cyanide.
Oh, relax, Rachel.
Killing you is not part of the plan. We need you to deliver a package first.
-[groans] -I've loved working with you, Rachel.
Hand on heart.
[Nomad] Stone?
Stone?
She's awake. She's awake.
[nurse panting] Hold her here. Hold her down.
Oh shit.
-[grunting] -Take this. Help me. Help me here.
Keep her steady.
Cholinest-- Cholines--
Wait. Get me atropine. Five mils.
It's cholinesterase.
Jack. Jack.
-[Jack] We've been breached. -How?
It's… There's a Trojan in our system delivered wirelessly.
Chewing through security like it isn't there.
Restrict all access.
Nomad, I've tried. No-go. They're trying to access the Heart.
[Nomad] From where? We're walled off.
It's a weak wireless signal. It's coming from…
inside the building.
Stone.
[doctor] Quickly. We need to monitor her airway.
-[nurse] Go ahead. -[doctor] Hold her.
Press down.
That didn't do it.
-[Stone breathing heavily] -Stone.
What's happened? I need to know what's happened.
How long were we compromised?
[Jack] Three minutes and 45 seconds. Running a system check now.
We need to know what they accessed. Is the Locker safe?
The Locker is still flying high
with the Heart safe inside, 85,000 feet up.
No one's getting up there without a space shuttle.
It's passing over the Atlantic, towards West Africa.
And the other suits, can they still access the Heart?
-Looks like it-- Jesus. -What?
There've been 100,000 attempts to access files.
Clubs team are analyzing the data, but looks like our security held.
We need to shut it all down now.
-Shut what down? The Heart? -Until we know what they've done.
We have no idea what they're capable of.
Don't need to shut it down to find out what they've done.
-We'd be harming ourselves. -We don't know. She's not stupid.
-And neither are we. -Sure about that? Because right now--
Rachel. Rachel. He's right. We'll sort it.
"We"?
A word in private. Now.
I told you. I knew Keya was playing us, playing the Heart.
No, you didn't. No, you didn't You had a feeling.
Nothing… nothing concrete, nothing actionable.
A mood, a notion, a hunch, a bollocks. We don't trade in those.
I knew she wouldn't be there.
You ignored the Heart, and you went back in.
-To save my team. -They weren't your team.
They died anyway. You going back made sure of that.
You blew your cover.
If you'd left when we told you to, Parker would've followed you,
we'd have caught him, and Yang and Bailey might be alive.
-I should've just listened to the Heart? -Yes.
The Charter exists for one reason.
To maximize lives saved. That's the only moral metric there is.
And it's a calculation. A pure and objective calculation.
Made for us by a machine.
Have you forgotten how radical that is?
It doesn't mean that what we do is easy or feels nice.
You'll have the voices of those people in your head for the rest of your life.
And you will never not feel responsible for them ever.
But the end justifies the means.
I spent every day with Parker for a year and didn't see it coming.
No.
Neither did the Heart.
So, what do we do now?
[groans] I'm…
Gonna make some tough choices, and this is the first one.
I'm standing you down, Rachel.
Go home. Get some rest.
Keep your head down. Don't do anything stupid.
You can't do this.
You're compromised.
Parker knows you. Dhawan knows you.
And the other Kings, quite rightly… don't know if you can be trusted.
And you?
I want to protect what we've spent 20 years trying to build.
So, I'm just out.
It's about the greater good.
It's nothing personal.
No.
I'm starting to see that.
[man] Hello?
-Stone? Wrong number. Wait. -It's for me.
[man] That's my phone. I--
[Keya] So, why is a Charter agent riding around all alone,
just hours after being poisoned?
Doesn't feel like they're taking care of their most valuable player.
What do you want?
[Keya] Don't be a sore loser.
I bet you used to think we were so alike. Now you know I'm better.
Better? You killed my friends.
What?
[Stone] You didn't know, huh?
Well, I told you this wasn't a game, Keya.
Heart or no Heart,
I'm coming for you.
-Morning, ma'am. -Morning.
[man] Nomad. Great spot.
All four kings in the same room. How long has it been, three years?
Not long enough.
So, who is this Parker, and how did we miss him?
Career intelligence agent. Born in Belfast, lives alone.
He has no one he cares for. There's nothing much to live for.
He has devoted his life to a country that sees him as expendable.
Okay. We get it. All that is fuel for the fire.
-But it won't burn without a spark. -[woman] I was getting to that.
I had to lean extremely hard on some very old friends for this.
Chechnya, December 2015.
What's this?
It was before your time. Before the Heart, for that matter.
A Chechen warlord was given free rein by the Chechen and Russian governments.
The West, as always, were looking the other way.
He was wiping out whole villages, trying to stamp out dissent.
But… what's this got to do with Parker?
He was there.
Different identity. No electronic records.
But he was there, with MI6,
delivering weapons to take the warlord out.
[man] Any sign of them?
You got an ETA yet?
They'll be here.
[woman] We intercepted a communication.
It was a trap.
[King] Intelligence came through from MI6 that their entire team had been executed.
We thought there was no one left to save.
The region was a tinderbox on the verge of full civil war.
We couldn't let those weapons fall into the warlord's hands.
It would have cost thousands of lives.
We had a drone that was stationed overhead armed with missiles.
I gave the order myself.
We made it look like a rebel force had ordered the drone strike.
MI6 buried their mistake.
No report, no investigation.
No record of the personnel who had been involved.
We thought everyone had died.
Until a few hours ago.
What a mess.
So, you think… he knows it was us?
I think that's a safe assumption.
And now he wants to destroy the Charter.
You killed Bailey and Yang?
That wasn't the plan.
You stick to the tech and leave strategy to me, okay?
Let me remind you, we're partners. Okay? So if you want me to do my job,
you have to tell me what you're doing before you do it.
Let me remind you, the Charter don't give two shits
Let me remind you, the Charter don't give two shits about people like Bailey and Yang.
So, if you want us to succeed, you shouldn't either.
[Stone] Hey, Barry.
I'm a friend of your dad's.
It's okay.
[whispers] I've got you.
The camera.
She hacked into the camera feed.
Let's see how well she covered her tracks.
There she is.
What's in the desert, Keya?
I'm guessing it's not the nightlife.
Are you shitting me?
West Africa. The Locker.
[Parker] You ever done this before? Choppered in at over 40,000 feet?
Trick question. No one has.
But my mama always said I could do anything.
How long do we have before the Locker descends?
Eleven hours and seven minutes.
At which point, the Charter will realize what's going on.
It'll take nine minutes and 26 seconds for the Locker to drop to 40,000 feet.
We'll have about eight minutes to get in, take the Heart,
and get out again before they regain control.
Very precise.
You're sure?
No. I'll be sure when it descends.
If they found my code, it won't descend, they'll be waiting for us, and we all die.
-Hey. -Good morning.
What time is it?
Uh, it's nearly seven.
What? Oh shit.
[Ivo] Any luck?
Uh… nothing. But they need to pop their heads up at some point.
-I'll see if they-- -[alarm blaring]
Oh no, no, no, no, no.
Get Nomad now! Get Nomad now!
Just get me up there. I'll do the rest.
Nomad will string me up for this.
Tell her I stole your keys.
You'll just have to trust me.
[Keya] Okay. Moment of truth.
How will we know if it's worked?
Would you look at that?
The Locker has been dropped 15,000 feet in the last two minutes.
Still descending.
Security systems are all down. I'm locked out.
-How is that even possible? Another hack? -No. No.
-How is that even possible? Another hack? -No. No. This is why they did it the first time.
It's been lying dormant in our system until now.
-Can you override it? -I'm trying.
[Ivo] The air lock's been breached.
Contact every Charter agent in the region.
There's no one within 500 miles.
[pilot] Approaching coordinates in five, four, three--
-I hope you know what you're doing. -[Stone] Tell me about it.
-We have a something approaching fast. -[Nomad] A something?
-[Jack] Thirty seconds out. -What is it?
I think-- I think it's a someone.
Who is it?
Go in closer.
Is that--?
It's Stone.
I have to descend. Lower the rotor speed.
[Parker] Copy that. See you in seven minutes.
[Nomad] She's not gonna make it.
Look who it is.
-I'm gonna need a minute. -No!
The ship's lining is filled with hydrogen. One spark, and we're all dead.
No way to get hold of her.
Come on, Rachel.
Come on.
It's over, Keya.
For who?
I told you not to get out of the van.
You also told me to have some fun.
It's gone.
And now you answer to me.
We've lost the Heart.
Not yet.
Parker. Ninety seconds. Let's go.
[Parker] Shame about your parachute. You'll be needing that.
-[Stone grunts] -[Keya] Get off me!
No, no, no, no, no! [screams]
-Get after them. -Impossible.
-We'll be lucky to get to base as it is. -[grunts]
Get away!
Leave me alone!
Morning, sunshine.
Give me that thing before somebody gets--
I don't think so.
So, here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna secret-agent our way back to civilization,
and I'm gonna follow three steps behind you with this gun.
-Where's the Heart? -Parker has it.
But I encrypted it to my biometrics, so it's useless without me.
Come on, get up.
If I shoot you now, all this is over.
Show you the same mercy you showed Bailey and Yang.
It's the logical play, Rachel.
It's what the Heart would tell you to do.
I'm not like you.
On your feet.
We need to keep moving.
So, what's the plan, Keya?
Trying to get even with Niam Kharche for kicking you out of the penthouse?
Right. You think you know everything.
I bet the Heart told you that he adopted me,
lifted me out of nothing. But did it tell you why?
Kharche used my parents like lab rats in a medical trial, and it killed them.
He covered everything up and took me in thinking he was doing me a favor,
but I let him think that because I knew one day,
but I let him think that because I knew one day, I'd be strong enough to make him pay for what he did to my parents.
I'd be strong enough to make him pay for what he did to my parents.
So, you get to tear the whole world down?
Oh, this is not just for me.
It's for people like me.
Parker's gonna destroy the Charter.
I've got my whole naughty list, and we're going to expose them all.
With no thought of what comes next.
You're a child.
And you think the Charter's any better?
Just because they saved you doesn't make them good.
You think I didn't look into you?
How many schools did you get kicked out of?
Seven? Eight?
Always a rebel. Always a problem.
Violent, alone, helpless.
-Stop. -Until the Charter comes along, right?
And gives you that discipline that you so clearly crave.
But did they take you in because you were good?
-Or because you were broken? -Enough.
Maybe I was broken.
But there's a woman I know only as Nomad.
She rescued me, trained me,
showed me what's possible when there's someone watching your back.
Where is she now?
Let's go.
Parker's coming for you, and I wanna have a bigger gun when he shows up.
They're headed for us.
Maybe it's Parker.
It's definitely not the Charter.
[Stone] Mercenaries?
Okay, let's just, um, give them a good cover story.
They'll keep us alive for ransom. We reel them in, and then bam.
Just to be clear, the "bam" is for you to take them out.
Yeah, I get that.
[in English] You know, the Charter can take down Kharche.
Parker's way isn't the only way.
[in English] Come with me.
She got away.
That wasn't the deal.
Killing her wasn't the deal either. You have to pay me now.
The deal changed.
You're a hard woman to find.
Six of Hearts.
Nomad sends her best.
Dhawan is back with Parker. I slipped her a tracker.
They're heading north. Looping you in now.
[Nomad] Hi, Rachel.
Nice to hear your voice. I was a bit worried about you.
Were you?
Okay, got her. They're heading towards Iceland.
I take it I'm no longer compromised.
Well, they have the Heart, so we're all compromised.
Parker's coming after the Charter, so we're heading to a secure location.
Clubs is assembling a team.
We'll make sure they're on the ground by the time you arrive.
And if we're too late?
Just get there as fast as you can.
If they get the Heart online, God knows what they're capable of.
I'm on my way.
It's not impregnable, but it's the best we've got.
If the Heart wants to find us, it will.
[Stone] Will this hunk of junk make it to Iceland?
Hell yeah.
Nice trick you pulled with the facial recognition yesterday.
Trying to put a lock on our new toy.
Would you come back for me if I hadn't?
We're a team, Keya.
Don't do it again.
I think I have it.
I know where they're going. Reykjavik University computer lab.
It has a cryo-storage facility, several floors of servers.
The tracker's heading straight for it.
See, Keya, don't say I don't keep my promises.
Okay, be ready. You know your instructions.
Couple of minutes, we'll be up and running.
Are we up?
We're up.
Is this your naughty list?
Emails, texts, bank accounts. The Heart's using my algorithm to sort through it all.
So, we can find anyone? Gain access to anything?
Greatest skeleton key in the world.
Show me.
[Keya] There it is.
Evidence of Kharche's years of experiments on innocents across the country.
That's the truth… for the world to see.
That's impressive. But let's see what else this thing can do.
Find me the Kings.
What are you doing?
[woman] Nancy Morrison. King of Diamonds. Ex-CIA.
The Heart tells us she's heading to a safe house with her family.
Drop the lift.
Are you serious?
No. Do--
You're welcome.
[man] Hang on. I have another one.
I think you're gonna like this, boss.
An unidentified military plane landed at a private airfield 33 minutes ago.
There.
Jiang Hsu. Served 35 years in Chinese State Security Service.
The King of Clubs is here in Iceland.
Even better. Where is he now?
Two minutes out.
Sending the plans now. Stone is on her way.
We don't have time to wait. Tell her to follow us in.
Any news of Spades or Hearts?
[man] Nothing yet.
There were other people in that elevator. In that lobby.
Calm down, Keya.
You said we were going to expose Kharche and then the Charter, not murder them.
The King of Hearts with her team. They're in a bunker outside of London.
Good.
Take them out.
[Clubs] We're approaching now.
-We'll see you on the other side. -You're going in with them?
I ordered the strike on Parker. It's only fair.
You know… I would have made the same call in Chechnya.
Thanks. The right--
I've lost contact.
The Heart's online.
No, no, no, no.
We're locked in.
[Jack] Oh God. They've shut off our ventilation system.
No, no, no, no.
Jack, how long we got?
At this rate, about an hour and we're out of oxygen.
The Charter never worries about who gets in their way. Neither will we.
[woman] King of Hearts is locked in. They'll be dead in an hour.
-You have to stop this, please. -Someone has to control this power, Keya.
-Why not us? -This is not what we agreed.
You're still not seeing the bigger picture.
This isn't about some pissy little grievance you had
with the bad man who killed your mom and dad.
This is about power.
Concentrated in the hands of the few, of the very few who could use it for good,
who could actually make a change, but they don't.
At this moment, we are mining trillions of pieces of data.
In a matter of hours, I will be able to take down
In a matter of hours, I will be able to take down the remaining members of the Charter.
We've been used and manipulated our whole lives.
Now it's time for us to take control.
[Clubs] Go.
[man] Clubs team are inside the university building.
What… are you doing?
You wanna know how great men get power, Keya?
It's not because they earn it…
or because they deserve it.
It is because when the moment comes,
they take it.
Stone is one minute out.
In position. We're all set.
[woman] She's approaching the university.
Stone, you need to get out now.
I don't have long.
Keya?
I have a failsafe uploading. It will disable the Heart.
They won't be able to access it without me.
I'm outside. But you already know that.
No, you're not. It's a trap.
I found your tracker.
The lab is a decoy. You need to get your team out now.
-Why should I believe you? -Because you were right.
Okay? You told me about Parker, and you were right about everything.
My parents would have never wanted this.
Just please listen to me.
Get your team out of there right now.
-Tell me where you are. -[Keya] Okay.
I'm sending you my coordinates. I'll leave the back door open.
Shit.
[grunts] I'm Nine of Hearts. I need your radio.
[groans] Go.
This is Nine of Hearts. Get out of there. It's a trap.
Do you hear me? She found the tracker. Get out of there.
Do you hear me?
Yeah… I hear you.
What's going on?
-Where is she? -[woman hesitates]
-[woman mumbles] -What has she done?
-How long to fix it? -Oh.
I-- Could be minutes. Could be hours.
You have until I get back.
[Jack] The door won't move.
[grunts] Damn it!
[Ivo] There must be an emergency override system.
We must have missed something.
Jack, is there any way we can get hold of Stone?
No. No comms. We're still offline.
Maybe-- Maybe try the landline.
[groans] Okay. Okay.
-[Nomad] Stone, thank God. Where are you? -Clubs are dead.
University was a trap.
I have new intel.
A new location.
We've-- We've lost Clubs?
What new intel?
[Stone] Keya. She shut down the Heart.
-How do you know she's not playing you? -I don't.
[Nomad] We're gonna die in less than an hour.
-They shut down our air supply. -What?
-She shut down our air supply. -[Stone] Parker did.
I believe her, Nomad.
I'd be dead too if I hadn't listened to her.
I trust her, and you need to trust me.
Fifty minutes.
I can work with that.
I'll see you.
You too.
Sorry, I need your truck.
[Parker] I know you're in here, Keya.
You know, you still have a choice.
You can still be a part of this.
You're only delaying the inevitable.
-Would you like me to wait? -[Stone] Definitely no.
But thanks!
Come on, Keya.
[Nomad] Settle down now.
Conserve air.
-Move. -[panting]
Get the Heart back online.
Do it!
Get up.
Get up!
[Parker] Right. Where do we start?
Fingers?
No, we'll be needing those. Knees?
-[Keya screams] -Yeah.
Last chance.
[inhales] Okay, I'll do it.
Go on.
I need to get back in there.
The Heart has to be disconnected and reconnected again to the servers.
Any interference, the system automatically shuts down. You know that.
[Parker] Move.
This doesn't end well for you, Stone. Take another step, and she's dead.
-I don't care. I'm here for you. -[Parker] Bullshit.
You and I know that without this one,
the Heart stays down and everyone inside that bunker dies,
unless, of course, they're dead already.
I have the Heart, and I have the Kings. That's a winning hand.
Okay. I'll put it down.
Good girl. Now, kick it away.
Tell me this, though.
What's your point, hm?
And why do you have to kill them to make it?
I've served my entire life, Rachel, and none of it mattered.
The world is still in chaos.
The Heart has the power to change everything.
But the Charter are using it to keep things exactly as they are.
You don't wanna change anything. You just wanna be the one in charge.
First thing you did with all that power was kill people.
[scoffs] The problem with men like you, Parker,
is that your power is only ever based on threats and violence.
And when you brutalize everyone around you, even your own team…
you'll never have the one thing I know I always will.
Yeah?
And what is that, Rachel?
Someone to watch my back.
Maybe in the next life. [chuckles]
See you when I get there. [exhales]
[Stone] Nomad, tell me you're okay.
Is everyone still with us?
[groans] Yeah, yeah.
It's good to hear from you, Stone.
I knew I would.
Hey, Barry.
What's this?
I don't know.
It's beautiful.
[girl] But what is it? Who's it from?
[Stone] Looking good.
I decided to embrace the cliché and use my time in jail to get ripped.
You've had worse goals.
So my lawyers tell me.
And you? Back with the Charter?
[inhales] Yeah, I'm back with the Charter.
But on two conditions.
The Heart's an amazing tool.
But that's all it is.
If we only follow the odds, we'll never do anything in spite of the odds.
And what if the odds tell you to do nothing?
That's when they send me.
What's the second thing?
I liked my team, Keya.
I miss them.
I wanna surround myself with people who will change the world for good.
How we doing, Jack?
[Jack] Good news and bad news.
The good news, I've scouted the square, and your plan just might work.
The bad news--
[exhales] Uh, they were out of oat milk.
-[car door closes] -Jack.
What? You told me to blend in.
Did we get into the power grid?
Yeah. It wasn't that hard, because their password was "password."
Your coffee.
Thank you.
This is cold.
Um, you know we can still throw you in jail, right?
[Stone] Hey.
Stay in the van.
We stay in the van, boss.
-The Heart's all set. -[Stone] And the diversion?
Ready.
Two men.
Approximately
40 goats.
They're not on anybody's side. We don't have to shoot them.
Egress?
Primary over the top, secondary down the road, tertiary to the river.
No one can track you through the water except a fish.
Sarah's headed off to nursing' school next month.
She sewed that herself.
It's beautiful.
You sure this is a peacekeeping mission?
Normally there isn't any peace to start with.
This shit's awful calm.
-Not at these coordinates. -Yes, sir.
Go ahead and plot an alternate.
Yes, sir.
[man over radio] Command Post, Command Post, this is TS-129, over.
Sir, I have visual confirmation of TS-129's current position.
[man 1] Mission accomplished, en route to extract site. Distance eight klicks. Over.
[Donnie] Command Post, Command Post, this is Viper.
I have friendly forces moving towards extraction point, over.
Heads up, our boys are coming through.
[man] Viper, this is CP. Be advised,
possible hostile forces approaching TS-129 at their twelve o'clock.
[Swagger] Call them out.
Target.
Sector Bravo, deep.
Vehicle, belt-fed weapon.
Range it.
870 yards and closing.
Wind, three-quarter value, push two left.
900 yards. Wide spot on the road.
On target.
Hold scope.
Fire when ready.
Hit.
[Donnie] Command Post, this is Viper. Hostile threat down, over.
[man] Viper, this is Command Post. We copy your traffic, over.
Call it in. It's time to go.
Command Post, this is Viper. Mission accomplished.
-Packing up. -Shit!
[man] Viper, be advised [gunfire] larger hostile forces approaching near sector Bravo.
Weren't supposed to be hostiles that close!
Crooked tree. 675, 30 miles an hour, three-mil lead.
Position to machine gun. 900, three-quarter value.
Fire when ready.
Jefe. 920. Three-quarter value.
I see it, Donnie. I see it. Fire when ready.
[Donnie] They don't know where we are. But they might get lucky!
[Donnie] Command Post, Command Post, this is Viper.
Enemy forces have been stopped. Break.
Friendlies are continuing on to extract point. Break.
Friendlies are continuing on to extract point. Break. We're receiving small arms and indirect fire from hostile troops. Break.
Command Post, do you read me?
Shut it down.
They're highly-trained men,
eight kilometers inside a country we are not supposed to be in.
I'm sure they'll get out just fine. Shut it down now.
[Donnie] Radio check. Do you read me?
-Okay, wrap it up. Let's go! -Do you read me?
[man 1] Pull out those tracks. [man 2] Pull out those tracks and pack it up!
Intelligence said they didn't have air support!
Call it in!
Shit! The channel's down!
That's impossible! The comm link's dead!
They left us here. Don't worry, we're getting home!
[screams] Donnie?
Donnie!
Come on, boy!
Come on, Sam!
What're you doing, huh? What're you doing?
Come on.
What? I got nothing.
What?
All right, come on, let's go. Let's go.
That's a good boy.
Good boy.
Well, let's see what lies they're trying to sell us today.
Here, boy.
Good boy.
[Sandor] Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger.
USMC, retired.
He is the best there is.
[Dobbler] His last assignment went wrong.
Put in unfriendly territory on a loan-out and left as expendable.
Opposing force sent an attack helicopter
and a hundred-man company.
His best friend and spotter was killed.
No official report.
Ghost report says he inflicted 70 percent casualties, the rest fled.
The agency asset that left them there to die?
Suddenly removed from the face of the earth two weeks after.
They never laid it at Bob Lee's feet.
He retired a week later.
I guess Bob Lee didn't think he was expendable.
[Johnson] Grows and shoots his own food.
[Dobbler] Yeah, he rarely ventures out at all.
This is a man with a history of duty and patriotism.
Not as punch lines, but as core beliefs. Aye.
Some people don't know what to do when their belief system collapses.
Bob Lee is one of those.
You sure, boy?
Nope. I ain't buying. I don't want any.
You guys turn around and go back to wherever you came from.
Bob Lee Swagger?
My name is Colonel Isaac Johnson.
You're a hard man to find.
But not hard enough.
Come a long way to see you.
We have some business needs your attention.
You wanna use your low gear going down the road
or your brakes'll go.
-Come here. Come here, boy. -[Sam snarling] Don't do that.
Come near the porch I didn't invite you, you'd have to shoot the dog.
That's a slow draw you got there.
Sure you want to do that?
Shoot a dog in this county on a man's land,
I'd bury you in the hill, and tell the sheriff a month or two later.
He understands.
Take your hand off your weapon.
Slowly.
So the gunnery sergeant doesn't have to bury you in the hill.
I don't carry a gun.
You know what that is?
It's a Congressional Medal of Honor.
They don't hand those out easy.
Yours?
Yeah.
Your father had one, didn't he?
What did you do?
Something foolhardy. Kept some other boys alive.
Will you give me five minutes?
Yeah, your dog stays outside.
Come on, boy. Get in there.
I need you to plan a presidential assassination.
Whose president?
Ours.
I didn't say "execute".
Plan.
So it can be stopped.
There's gonna be an attempt on the life of the President in the next two weeks.
Code was broken on an anonymous transmission.
It was internal.
We can't go to the usual agencies.
The government itself has been penetrated.
The President has three public engagements during that time.
Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C.
Standard Secret Service protective cordon
is out to 880 yards.
But this intercept claims that the shot will be taken from beyond a mile.
We need you to scout, tell us how you would do it,
so we could stop it.
I'm not entirely convinced that a shot like this could be made.
But let's not take the chance.
Your longer shots were never confirmed.
That's because long shots generally go places
you wouldn't wanna have to go afterwards to confirm them.
Confirmation's a desk pogue's problem.
You know what it takes to make a shot at that range?
Everything comes into play that far.
Humidity, elevation, temperature, wind, spindrift.
There's a 6-to-10-second flight time
so you have to shoot at where the target's going to be.
Even the Coriolis effect, the spin of the Earth, comes into play.
President'll be wearing body armor. That means a head shot.
At over a mile.
You believe there's a shooter involved capable of making this shot?
Yes.
Well, then you got a real problem. You need to find the shooter.
That's being worked on from another direction.
We need you to do this.
Don't really like the President much.
Didn't like the one before that much, either.
You like the idea of the President?
Living in a free country?
Do we allow America to be ruled by thugs?
Sure, some years we do.
I believe you stood before a flag
and solemnly swore
that you'd support and defend the Constitution of the United States
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.
I think your five minutes is up.
Listen to me, son.
I don't want you to turn on the TV next week
and see the President dead,
and know you could've done something about it.
Don't do that to yourself.
[Swagger] Is that the new one?
The truck.
You got the big engine in there?
Wow, look at that, huh? Eight-liter V8.
Thing's so big, EPA doesn't even bother to give you the gas mileage for it.
You mind if I take a picture?
This is beautiful.
Someone will be at this number night or day.
You see what he did? He didn't need a photo of the engine.
No, he doesn't give a rat's ass about the engine.
He's trained in counterintel.
Backed up far enough to take a picture of the plates.
This is our guy.
I thought he turned you down.
He said yes. He just doesn't know it yet.
1,760's a mile.
It's a far piece, Sam. Think the President ought to worry?
Yeah, I think he better worry.
Yeah, he'll be fine.
Just feed him once a day. Read him a few ballistics tables if he looks lonely.
Yep. I'm out.
Come here, buddy.
Okay.
Think you'll be able to tough it out without me for a couple days? Huh?
Yeah.
[man on radio] This is Command Post. What's your status? Over.
[man 2] Yeah, we're finishing up here on sixth.
[man 1] Roger that. We copy. Checkpoint down, over.
[man] Before you stands Independence Hall, the birthplace of the United States
and one of the most important buildings in American history.
Built in 1732…
[man 2] Keep a visual eye on 72nd.
…both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution
were debated and signed here.
[Swagger] Out of the three cities,
there's only one with a reasonably high chance of success.
There was no room in Baltimore.
Street isn't wide enough to correct for the windage,
buildings are in the way.
D.C.'s a pure suicide mission.
I mean, unless you're sure your shooter's interested in 70 virgins
waiting for him in the afterlife,
I'd rule that out.
Shot's got to be taken from Philly.
From beyond 1,800 yards, though.
It's one of six possible locations,
approximately five stories above the President's location.
Flight time of the bullet that distance is five to six seconds.
They'll have to wait till he takes the podium,
several lines into his speech.
That way he'd be completely static, obviously at his most exposed.
Shot requires a large-caliber weapon.
Expect the bullet to be handmade, bronzed alloy turned on a lathe.
Slightly lower ballistics coefficient,
touch more slippery.
Least that's what I'd do.
You can kill him from that far away?
Mile and a half, the bullet's going to strike with more energy
than a .44 Magnum point blank.
Yeah, I think you can kill him.
The challenge is the wind.
Lightest breeze uncorrected at that distance
is enough to ruin the shot.
He's gonna need indicators between the podium and the shooting position.
Velocity corrections are easy,
but an angle change, that becomes a trig problem.
He's gotta do that in his head on the fly.
Without something to gauge, your shot's just too tough to make cold bore.
[Johnson] Impressive recon and report, son.
Move too soon, we lose him.
We want to take him alive.
If we don't know who hired him, it could just happen again.
We'll have six three-man teams standing by.
Gunnery Sergeant Swagger?
A moment?
You've done your country a great service, son.
-On the day… -Look…
Listen.
You're one of the few people who knows what to look for.
I could use a spotter.
[man] Thank you, Philadelphia.
The President speaks in 20 minutes.
…before you on this stage…
[Johnson] Notify our teams. Check their positions.
…patriots met in Independence Hall and created a document,
the Declaration of Independence…
[officer] Sir?
…and a country, the United States of America,
that changed the world.
Philadelphia is our home. We are…
[man 1 on radio] Stand by, all teams. This is Listening Post.
Flashlight's current location is approaching Checkpoint Jason.
All sniper teams send update on your sitrep.
Stand by. [man 2] Yes, I have a clear line of sight.
[woman on radio] Copy that.
[man] Post 18 clear, over.
[woman] Post 19, please report. What's your status?
All clear. There's really nothing going on here.
[man] The Archbishop of Ethiopia…
[newscaster 1] The President will be awarding the Philadelphia Brotherhood Medal
to His Grace Desmond Mutumbo, the Archbishop of Ethiopia.
[newscaster 2] There's been some controversy surrounding the Archbishop
as he's been speaking out regarding the atrocities in his country.
He plans to meet with the President right after the ceremony
to discuss these matters.
[Archbishop] These are great times.
[Archbishop] These are historic times.
And these are troubled times, as well.
This medal that your country…
[Swagger] Yellow ribbons.
Yeah, people put those up to remember the troops.
No, they tie those low around trees.
These are windage flags.
Roughly the location I'd have put them in
for a shot from the steeple.
Yeah. Maybe.
No, definitely. He knows what he's doing.
You guys got a team in place to take out the church?
They'll move right before the shot is taken, when his focus is elsewhere.
[Archbishop] …raises its head and confronts freedom,
but slyly, subtly, chokes it off at the root.
And it is our responsibility
to find these dark weeds.
[man] Flashlight has arrived. I say again, Flashlight has arrived.
Phew! [woman] If you just joined us…
Officer Timmons, our local resource.
Bob Lee Swagger.
It is a real honor to meet you.
You're unsnapped, officer.
Shit. Oh, fuck.
Don't want to lose that now, do I?
Again, it's an honor.
[Archbishop] …of our stewardship of this great…
[Swagger] That our guy in the collar? [Johnson] The Archbishop of Ethiopia.
He's getting a medal. Know it?
HOA. Horn of Africa. Yeah.
You know I worked there?
You know what they say about the first thing that you feel
You know what they say about the first thing that you feel when you shoot a civilian?
-Recoil of your rifle? -Right.
[Swagger] That's very original.
[announcer] Thank you, Archbishop, for those inspiring words.
[Johnson] The President speaks next.
All teams stand by.
[man on radio] Agent Gibson, we read your fly-by. Situation all clear, over.
[man 2] Agent James, all clear.
[announcer] Now it gives me enormous pleasure…
-Got wind at three, full value. -…to introduce to you
the President of the United States.
Make it four-and-a-half minutes of angle.
Three-mil hold, in case the wind dies.
He's loaded.
Altitude, humidity, temperature accounted for.
[president] In the city that was the capital of…
[Swagger] We gotta take him.
Ten seconds.
Wind matches his setup. Take him! Take him now!
Send in the ERT team. Take out the…
[man] Shots fired! Shots fired!
[man on radio] Flashlight is down, Flashlight is down.
-What? Flashlight down? -I say again, Flashlight is down.
[newscaster 1] The President has been shot. [newscaster 2] There's mass confusion…
Has the President been shot?
[man] Right at the church steeple.
[Payne] How could you miss?
How could you fucking miss?
Thirty seconds, clear out. Chase him down.
He's bleeding. Kill him.
[man 1] Command Post to Condor Two, load up, over.
[man 2] Condor Two loading up.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Hurry up, guys. Come on.
[man] Condor Two, this is Command Post. Stand by for update, over.
[man 2] Standing by, over.
Command Post!
Command Post! Command Post,
this is Post 19. You guys read me?
-Should I hold post? -Please.
Please help me. Please. They shot me.
FBI. Put your hands up! Please. Hey.
Save me.
What?
Give me the keys.
I didn't shoot the President. Timmons was a setup.
-[car alarm beeping] -Help!
FBI! Took my weapon and my car.
Don't worry, I already shot him twice. You all right?
[man 1] CP, 17, can you repeat possible suspect description?
[woman 1] Negative, no further at this time.
[woman 2] CP, this is 15. No activity at my location.
I am available to move if necessary.
[woman 1] Copy that.
[Timmons on radio] This is Officer Timmons requesting backup.
Pursuing suspect in assassination.
Now fleeing in stolen FBI vehicle, moving south on Front from Diamond.
Suspect is armed and dangerous. I repeat,
suspect is armed and dangerous.
[woman 1] All Philly PD units be advised,
assassination suspect is fleeing in a stolen FBI vehicle.
He is going south on Front from Diamond.
[man 2] This is Condor 2. We are transitioning from roadhouse to Front Street.
Please advise for further description of suspect vehicle.
[woman 1] Dispatch, 419, I'm heading south on Thompson.
Do we have a color, anything on the vehicle?
[woman 1] Assassination suspects vehicle
is one government-issue black 2006 Ford Crown Vic.
Pennsylvania license number 7-3-1-7 James David Edward, over.
[man] What was suspect's last known location? Over.
[woman 1] Last known is south on Front.
Do we have multiple suspects or a single suspect?
[woman 1] Agent James, negative. No further information…
[man 1] This is Agent Pittman. Car seen going high speed on Castor.
High speed on Castor. Be advised.
Timmons called it in?
Right on time, like he was supposed to.
-Before he shot him again. -Well, he's been hit twice,
so unless he can stop the bleeding without going to the hospital or a doctor,
it doesn't really matter.
They're going to find him lying dead by a dumpster in an alley in 20 minutes.
[man 1] What is your location?
[man 1] Suspect vehicle a black sedan, four-door…
[woman 1] All units be advised,
eyewitness reports suspect vehicle entering High-Tech Car Wash
on the northwest corner of Girard and 9th, over.
[man 2] Command Post be advised,
this is Condor Two en route to suspect location, over.
[man 3] Command Post, Condor Three copies. All en route.
-Yo, man! -Watch it, man!
Shit!
[man 2] Command Post, Condors Two and Three moving to intercept, over.2
[officer 1] Suspect vehicle collided with a truck under the 95.
He's at Market and Columbus.
[officer 1] Looks good. Vehicle is disabled. Repeat, vehicle disabled.
[officer] Take him down! Fire!
I got a Crown Vic. Black. Government plates.
Dead guy in the front seat?
I want the banks of this river lined for 30 miles, five minutes ago.
All right. Let's start the search downriver.
[reporter] I'm here with Officer Timmons, who pursued the suspect on foot.
Officer, can you tell us what happened?
[newscaster 1] The would-be assassin, tentatively identified
as retired Marine Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger,
is being pursued by thousands of State and Federal law enforcement personnel
State and Federal law enforcement personnel as we speak.
[newscaster 2] As the net begins to tighten nationwide, there is still no trace of Swagger.
Nothing but an abandoned car has been found
at the bottom of the Delaware River.
[newscaster 3] Seven-year veteran Philadelphia police officer Stanley Timmons,
first to respond to the scene,
is believed to have shot and injured Swagger.
Early reports indicate that the assailant
may have been hit as many as two times.
Meanwhile, the FBI has been unwilling to comment
on information that an agent of theirs
was assaulted and disarmed by Swagger as he fled the scene,
possibly in a stolen FBI vehicle.
At this time, no sign of Swagger has been found.
You have embarrassed this office.
You will be facing a review from the Office of Professional Responsibility.
Sir…
Well, I don't feel embarrassed.
A Force Recon Marine Scout Sniper
disarmed me three weeks out of the academy.
If anything, I feel lucky to be alive.
Why'd he say he didn't shoot the President?
Because he didn't.
Also, he said Timmons was a setup.
He never said that.
City cop managed to spot, shoot this guy twice.
You got your ass kicked.
You're misremembering.
That's normal under extreme stress events.
Have you given your official statement yet?
Because I would be very cautious about what went in it.
Well, maybe I should wait for the report to come out, read it and then remember.
[man whispering] Can you believe this fucking guy?
There you go.
Yes?
The raw feeds are in from the networks.
[newscaster 1] …development, security camera footage from Washington, D.C.
and several locations in Philadelphia
shows the suspect, Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger,
scouting shooting locations, traveling and taking wind readings.
As the net begins to tighten nationwide, there is still no trace of Swagger.
Excuse me.
Can't sell you nothing. Just lost our power.
Please. I got cash, and you can keep the change.
Ain't gonna be able to find nothing.
Please, all I need is a marinade needle, some salt, some sugar,
couple bottles of water.
How many?
[Memphis] Well, sir, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sure she's a really nice Christian woman,
but we don't take care of those things here.
Yeah. Okay, well…
[newscaster] The FBI released a video letter threatening the life of the President.
…see a counselor. Dr. Phil or something. Okay.
…see a counselor. Dr. Phil or something. Okay. …signed and dated by Bob Lee Swagger just 10 days ago.
[newscaster 2] Federal agents today executed a search warrant
in the Wind River range of Wyoming
where Swagger had been living for several years.
In the meantime, the FBI has been unwilling to comment,
as no sign of Swagger has been found.
-Get anything? -No.
Yeah, wait, wait. Where was this?
[Turner] And? Yes? She thinks it was him, but it was dark because the power was out in the store.
-What'd he buy? -[man] Gotta be.
Uh, salt, sugar, water, and a marinade injector.
Guy going to a barbecue.
Salt, water, an injector could be used for an IV,
but what's with the sugar?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold that! Hold that!
Well, sugar's been used to treat battlefield wounds
for hundreds of years.
It has something to do with osmotic pressure.
It was popular during the Napoleonic War.
Uh-huh. You go into Howard's office with the Napoleonic War,
he's gonna put you on psych leave.
Go back to your desk. I'm saving your life.
-[gunshot] -One thing is…
…1790 to 1800.
-One thing is… -[gunshot]
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.
I know who you are.
You're Bob Lee. Swagger. Donnie's old partner.
Look, I didn't shoot the President.
I know.
You do?
The President's not dead. Ethiopian Archbishop is.
Why in the hell would somebody want to shoot him?
Look, you're a nurse, right?
No. No, that was Donnie's dream. I couldn't stand the blood.
I teach the third grade.
-Please. -Look, you should go.
Please.
Please?
I didn't do whatever they said I did.
I swear.
I'm in some bad trouble and I need some help.
I wouldn't have come all the way here to lie to you.
You still figuring on shooting me?
Only that shotgun's a little long to bring up fast.
Look, if you're going to do it, just get it over with.
I ain't got nowhere else to go.
Pull the truck in the garage. The neighbors will be up in a minute.
You'd best call me Sarah.
All right.
[woman] 911, what's your emergency?
Hello?
[woman] This is 911. We received a hang-up from this location.
Yeah, neighbor's dog knocked over the trash cans
and scared the hell out of me. Everything's fine. Thanks.
Okay, then.
Seems you call the police and hang up without saying anything,
they call you back right away.
I should've come and seen you in person.
Before. I mean, then.
Yeah, I read the letter.
It was okay.
And once a year I got the flowers.
You don't look real good.
I'm supposed to be dead. Been a long night.
Why aren't you?
Well, the U.S. government spent a lot of time and money
teaching me how not to die
after they got done teaching me how to kill people.
So how is it I'm supposed to help you?
You can do a running cross-stitch, finish it with an embroidery knot?
Yeah.
You got to try to spread it out.
It's gonna look odd you buy it all in one place.
How can it be three years ago when it seems like ten?
Mileage can be rough.
No one ever beats me in.
You never left.
Everyone keeps telling me I'm crazy.
Like I didn't see what I saw, or heard what I heard.
I'm not crazy, though. You think I'm crazy?
Where did all this stuff come from?
At first I thought it was Washington, Quantico.
I checked and it didn't. It just magically arrived.
Cooperating agencies, ATF, NRO, places that don't even have initials
they cooperate in times of national emergency.
You need to get some sleep.
You know that the first ballistics diagram got here
22 minutes after the shooting.
We're good at our jobs.
12 minutes after the shooting, they were still scrambling choppers.
The scene was locked down.
How did they get a reverse azimuth ten minutes after that?
I mean, we work for the federal government.
We're not that good at our jobs.
[Memphis] You want to see something? [woman] Probably not.
[Memphis] I downloaded this.
This is a full-scale printout
of a target Swagger shot two years ago at 1,000 yards.
I punched in the holes myself. It was at a competition.
I read an article. It said Swagger shot a silver dollar at a grand.
Five shots,
at 1,000 yards,
an inch-and-a-half spread. An inch and a half!
It was the capital of the United States…
That's the flag behind the President. It's barely waving.
This is the wind speed and direction
according to the National Weather Service
at the time of the shot. I did the math.
Now, how does a man who can do that
miss by two-and-a-half feet at 2,000 yards?
I don't get it.
[woman] You had a long night. Let it go and get some sleep.
You know, I saw Timmons interviewed.
He said he was walking foot patrol,
saw a rifle barrel sticking out of a window,
went upstairs to investigate, and shot Swagger.
No sniper sticks his rifle out of a window.
They shoot from cover, back in the room.
It doesn't make any sense.
-I'm gonna talk to Timmons. -No, you're not.
Why? 'Cause they're gonna fire me if I do?
Timmons was killed by a mugger in an alley last night.
In a conspiracy, all loose ends are trimmed.
Jack Ruby shoots Oswald?
Bad things happen to good people.
Yeah, not that quick, they don't.
Well, I stopped the bleeding temporarily.
But it'll cut loose again.
I held off the worst of the infection, but you're gonna have to open it up,
cut out and scrub away anything that's dead,
working your way out, sewing it together
and you got to try to make sure you don't re-infect it.
You ready for this?
I'm going to do all those Whip-it's and pass out.
Good luck, okay?
[Johnson] I need you to plan a presidential assassination.
[Swagger] That our guy in the collar?
Whose president?
[Johnson] I didn't say "execute".
He's getting a medal. Know it?
The Archbishop of Ethiopia.
[Swagger] You need to find the shooter.
No.
Two-and-a-half days, shot twice, no sign?
Find me something.
Maybe he crawled into a hole and died.
He's not dead.
Tear apart his life.
Again.
Go okay?
I've been hallucinating.
Something I need to tell you.
Ralphie's dead.
Who's Ralphie?
Well, they said you shot your dog
'cause you knew you weren't coming back.
They said that, huh?
Name was Sam.
He was a good dog. I raised him from a pup.
You okay?
No.
What are you gonna do?
I'll get better.
Then I'm going to burn their playhouse down.
Can I help you?
Hold still.
I been meaning to ask you.
You have a boyfriend?
Why?
Am I still supposed to be the grieving widow?
It's been three years.
No.
Just wonder if I'm gonna have to shoot somebody
walks through that door without knocking,
wondering where you've been.
Well, no.
Nothing steady. No boyfriend.
Not bad.
A little stiff, but…
Hey.
You know, you would've made one hell of a nurse.
That was really brave, what you did.
You saved my life.
I'm better. I better get to it.
They're never gonna stop chasing you.
Never.
They're never gonna stop looking.
In the meantime, they need someone else to find.
I'm going to give them him.
Excuse me?
May be a way to get two birds with that stone, too.
-Swagger? -Hey.
The gun Donnie learned to hunt with when he was a kid.
It ain't much, but it shoots true.
I cleaned and oiled it before I put it away.
You sure?
Yeah.
Why'd you go?
When they came to see you.
They know which buttons to press.
I'm still enough of a sucker, you press that patriot button,
I'll sit up in my chair and say, "Which way you want me to go, boss?"
I mean, I ain't real proud of it, but I ain't ashamed, either.
You know, I got a plan,
but I think I'm going to need your help.
Okay. I'll do it.
I haven't even told you what it is yet.
I know.
Look.
It was my fault.
What?
You know, with Donnie. I should never have…
What?
Don't you dare.
Don't you try and take that away from him.
He knew exactly what he was doing when he enlisted.
He knew exactly what he was doing
when he enrolled in scout sniper training.
He loved what he did.
No one made him do it.
That ain't yours to carry.
You're right.
I'm sorry I tried.
It's okay.
[Swagger] I need you to meet with this FBI agent.
Use him to flush Johnson out of his hiding place.
Give him the vehicle ID number. He'll do what he's trained to do.
You get in and get out. Don't get caught.
You get caught, I get caught.
[Sarah] You know what that is?
Says he didn't shoot no one, but I don't know.
Well, he's been staying with me.
Who's been staying with you? Bob Lee Swagger?
The plates are probably fake. Pretty sure the other number's real.
-And what is this? -A VIN number.
Seems no one goes through the trouble to change 'em anymore.
And you're going to sit real still until I'm long gone.
See the guy in the Eagles jacket?
[officer] Excuse me, sir. Can I see some ID, please?
Sir, I'm going to need you to take off your hat
and show me some ID.
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Take your hat off, asshole!
Get on the ground! Get your ass on the ground!
[man] Hey, how's it going?
Hey, John.
-[man] Hey, Ed? -[Ed] Yeah.
[man] You got that Stevens file we wanted back?
How badly do you want to know? Because this will get you fired.
Well, I have to go before the Office of Professional Responsibility
in 45 minutes for a review.
I'm gonna get fired anyway. I'm done worrying about that.
What do you think?
I think that CNN got the tapes before we did,
already edited together to show the angles.
Who delivered them?
An unnamed agency who will never confirm or deny.
They denied, which is a…
Which is a confirmation of sorts.
Of what?
That you are asking questions way outside your pay grade.
Oh, come on, just tell me.
You don't want to be here for that review.
They don't have to stop at firing you. They can charge you and hold you.
The ASAC's job comes with Delta clearance.
-Thank you. -Go.
[Dobbler] This is a copy of a chat-room transcript.
These guys talk about everything. I didn't give it much thought at the time.
We just traced it to a donut shop with free Wi-Fi.
But this, this is a Delta-level clearance request
out of the FBI field office in Philadelphia seven minutes ago.
Funny thing, Google Maps puts the donut shop
only three blocks away from the field office.
There's only one guy who met with Swagger before he disappeared.
He lives in Philly.
And he works for the FBI.
Nicholas Memphis.
[Galindo] …really strange company. Contracts with a lot of the Fortune 500.
Offices in Virginia, Delaware, registered in Panama.
They own a boat that's flagged out of Libya.
They're definitely not government,
but they have high ex-military contacts like you wouldn't believe.
These are contractors.
I can't tell what this company does, but…
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!
Memphis?
Memphis!
For a man who didn't know much,
you sure took a long, painful time to tell it.
Get him some water.
Good.
Got to pee yet?
Got to flush them drugs out of your system.
Look awful suspicious if you were to go and shoot yourself
pumped full of the same shit the agency uses.
I'm not going to shoot myself.
Sure you will.
Take him out. Get him ready.
No!
That's my gun.
Yeah.
You wrote a real touching suicide note, too.
All overwrought with guilt about your mistakes.
Quit your struggling.
This thing works. It's not the first time we've used it.
Russo. Russo!
Davis, get out here!
What is the goddamn hold-up?
Don't kill me, please! Don't kill me! I believe you!
Kill you?
Had enough chances. I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.
What kind of asshole'd think up a thing like this?
Not bad with a poodle shooter and a makeshift silencer, huh?
Help me toss these boys in the water?
You set me up and you used me as bait!
You think? Flushed them out, didn't it?
I was kind of hoping to keep one alive,
but they were kind of determined to kill you.
You can hire a good lawyer, and I'll call the Bureau.
They can work out some kind of deal.
This is explainable. You can prove that you didn't shoot the Archbishop.
I don't think you understand.
These boys killed my dog.
Hey, this is the 21st century. You can't go to war with these people.
In the end, the law is all…
In the end, the law'll never catch and hold them.
In a year or two, they'll be back in business.
New names, new messenger boys, same old story.
And I'll be dead.
It's gonna be some hard, hairy work, Pork.
There's gonna be more shooting, and more people are gonna die.
Now, I didn't start it, but be sure as hell I mean to see it through.
So you get it straight. You in or you out?
You know, I missed a meeting today
where I was going to get fired for unprofessional conduct
because I was kidnapped by people that don't exist.
I'll take his legs.
It's a good call, Pork.
You're trying to tell me a rookie FBI agent
overpowered and killed the three of them?
No.
They were shot from a distance of about 200 yards.
With a .22.
-Swagger's alive. -Yes.
And that young kid,
FBI Agent
Nick Memphis,
who managed to pry out a Delta-level clearance,
hasn't come back to the office and is out there with him.
What?
I just went over Swagger's financials again.
Once a year, he sent flowers to someone with his Visa card.
I cracked the FTD database, got an address.
Donnie Fenn's widow. Anniversary of his death.
She went back to using her maiden name,
which is why we missed it the first time.
She's maybe the only person in the entire world
that would believe anything that Swagger had to say.
Look. Keene City, Kentucky.
It's just within driving range.
What are you waiting for? Take the jet. All right.
We've given Swagger a new war,
he's found a new spotter.
This is about to get worse.
I think we're here.
Hey. Swagger.
I think we're here.
Welcome to Tennessee.
Patron state of shooting stuff.
Hey, who is this guy?
This guy was the greatest gunsmith east of the Mississippi. He's a legend.
He knows more about guns and the people who shoot them
than Smith & Wesson.
Don't really matter anymore. He knew we were coming the last three miles.
-You mind your manners. -All right.
You boys come a long way. What you looking for?
Wisdom.
You come to the wrong place.
Maybe.
Say a man wanted to fire a bullet from one rifle
and have it match exactly to another.
Could that be done?
Take a seat.
Have a chair, son.
If you could get a bullet that had been shot clean through the first rifle,
could make the grooves match.
Kind of thing ain't been done in a long time, though.
The bullet that was taken out of the Archbishop
was completely mangled on impact.
FBI match was metallurgical.
Thank you, Mother.
Yeah, but you couldn't guarantee that going in, so they had to be sure.
And I still can't figure out how they could be.
Good coffee? Yep.
Look on your left, there. Second shelf down.
Red leather spine.
Written by a guy named Schofeld.
Put it there 15 years ago. Don't figure it's moved since then.
Yeah. Paper patching.
State of the art. 1870s Africa.
Paper-wrapped bullet.
No metal on metal going down the barrel.
Grooves would match. Paper unwinds at the muzzle.
Leaves no traces when it hits.
Interesting question, though. Hope I satisfied you.
I got another one.
I thought you might.
Suppose I was looking for a man to make a 2,200-yard cold-bore shot.
Who's alive that could do that?
Seems I heard about a shot like that being made not too long ago.
Said the guy's name was Bob Lee Swagger.
Never met the man, so I wouldn't know him.
Yeah, they said that, all right.
They also said that artificial sweeteners were safe,
and WMDs were in Iraq,
and Anna Nicole married for love!
Would've been a bad job to take, though.
How come?
Whoever took that shot's probably dead now.
That's how a conspiracy works.
Them boys on the grassy knoll, they were dead within three hours.
Buried in the damn desert. Unmarked graves out past Terlingua.
And you know this for a fact?
Still got the shovel.
Sake of argument, somebody other than him?
There was a guy in Russia.
They locked his ass up.
Another one in France. I know he's dead.
There was one guy,
but he don't shoot no more.
A brutal son of a bitch.
Most boys shoot to kill. He'd shoot to wound,
wait till his friends come to help,
kill them too.
Turned one target into four.
Men, women, children. Killed them by the hundreds.
The other side wanted him. Bad.
Finally narrowed his hide down to an abandoned six-story building.
They quit the subtle tactics.
They called in an artillery strike.
Leveled a square block.
Brought the building down on his ass.
Some say he crawled out of there.
Some say he died.
Never heard from him no more.
Fuck me.
What?
I met the son of a bitch.
Yeah. The world ain't what it seems, is it, Gunny?
No, sir.
You keep that in mind.
The moment you think you got it figured,
you're wrong.
He got a name?
Hey, it's me, Nick.
Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in?
Yeah. Are you okay? Nick, where are you?
It's better I don't tell you.
Look, do you have a pen?
I need you to find someone. Mikhaylo Sczerbiak.
-Yeah. -You got it?
I got it.
Man, this is hard to spell.
Swagger is going to go with what he knows.
He'll try to track the shooter.
He won't get far that way.
Yes, he will.
How's that? We're going to help him.
Sometimes to catch a wolf, you need to tie the bait to a tree.
And what happens to the bait?
Hard to say.
But that's the nature of being the bait.
Hey, it's Nick. Did you find him? He's in Virginia.
[Johnson] An end we thought was tied up
came untied.
Meaning, Colonel?
Swagger is still alive.
Oh, my.
I need to land a transport plane without a customs check.
I'm certain I don't want to know, but what's on the plane?
Crew we used in Ethiopia.
Twenty-four good, hard men.
Weapons and gear.
Only 24?
Do kill him.
No loose ends this time.
Night, Colonel.
Good night, Senator.
Hello?
Someone there?
Now look.
Look what you've done now.
Give me that.
I don't want you to hurt yourself. Okay?
Where's your boyfriend?
[Memphis] What if it's a trap?
[Swagger] Oh, it's a trap.
Guaranteed. Every time.
Question is, for whom?
-You got your list, right? -Yeah.
All right, you make sure you stick to it.
Let's go.
Okay, so what are these for again?
Tear gas is going to be on my remote.
Right.
Napalm on the first floor. Pipe bombs on the rest of them.
Gotta be very careful with these. It's got a 15-foot kill radius.
So what exactly are we getting ready for?
For as much as we can be.
All right, you got four enemy combatants.
Take them one by one.
Keep shooting. Don't let anything distract you.
Fuck!
Didn't I say don't let anything distract you?
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. Let's see it.
No. No.
It's just you and me, baby.
No!
[Memphis] You got three guards.
One at your two o'clock,
twelve o'clock
and ten o'clock.
Danger close. Two o'clock, fifty yards.
[Memphis] You got one right on you.
Twenty yards and closing.
[Sandor] Go check the perimeter.
And tell the others to stay alert.
[guard] I'm on it. Right away, sir.
Swagger, you got one above you on the roof.
You killed all three?
There were four.
I want Johnson's real name. I want to know who he works for.
I want to know why it was worth going through that much effort
to kill the Archbishop.
Aren't you the one that shot him?
And if I don't know any of those things?
Then you're of no worth to me
and I might as well shoot you now and leave.
Johnson's had a lot of names.
Don't know one's any more real than the next.
Knowing would only be dangerous.
He's ex-army.
Pretty sure he was a full-bird colonel.
Go on.
They came for me, like they came for you.
Recruitment for a single job.
They like the wounded.
Easier to use
and then throw away when you are done.
Timmons, you, me…
Once you've been a wolf, it's hard to be staked down like a goat.
This is just one dead man talking to another.
And the Archbishop?
You want to take all suspicions away when you shoot someone,
wait till he's standing next to the President.
What was he going to say?
The truth.
That nothing, no matter how horrible,
ever really happens without the approval of the government.
Over there, and here.
The problem isn't the doing.
It's the people in power having to admit
that they knew.
The prisoners are tortured at Abu Ghraib,
and only the underlings go to jail.
Their bosses knew.
We know their bosses knew.
But you don't say it.
What exactly happened in Africa?
Somehow the villagers didn't think
that an oil pipeline
was a good enough reason to move their village
to a place where the spirit gods didn't exist.
Drink?
So they asked them all nicely to move
and when they didn't, they just killed them all?
No.
They didn't ask.
They just killed them.
All.
So the next village won't need to be asked.
They'll just go.
There is a mass grave with 400 bodies,
men, women, children,
under the oil-pumping station ten kilometers over the Eritrean border.
You should know.
You covered the retreat of the contractors who did the job.
Of course, you weren't supposed to survive that, either.
Who runs Johnson?
A senator. From Montana, I think.
You don't get it.
There is no head to cut off.
It's a conglomerate.
If one of them betrays the principles
of the accrual of money and power,
the others betray him.
What it is
is human weakness.
You can't kill that with a gun.
[whispering] Swagger. Swagger.
You got to get out of there. They're everywhere.
Had to keep you till they got here.
Lying wasn't going to hold you.
You would have known.
By the way, they've got your woman.
[Memphis] Swagger.
They're 20 yards and closing. You got to get out of there.
Bug out. Go to hide two. [Memphis] Roger that.
[panting] Swagger, I'm in position two.
You got to get out of there.
-They're all over the place. -Hey!
Calm down.
Blow the pipe bombs outside on my call, okay? You got it?
[whispering] Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got it.
Listen very carefully.
On my one, you blow the pipe bombs,
then the gas.
Three, two, one…
Hit it. Hit the napalm.
Swagger!
You got it.
[Memphis] Swagger!
Swagger!
Swagger!
You got to bug out on my go behind that barn.
Okay.
-You ready? -Yeah.
Go!
Come on!
You got to gun it to that tree line.
What?
You got five shots left. Gotta draw that bird out.
Okay. Okay.
On my cover, all right? Okay.
All right, go!
[man] Pull up! Pull up!
Time to go!
[woman] Let me take a look.
[Purnell] Not right now.
Morning, beautiful.
See this shootout in Virginia?
Shells everywhere, helicopter remnants, blood. No bodies, though, right?
And they get fingerprints off the cartridge cases.
First set positively ID'd as Bob Lee Swagger.
Second set belongs to Special Agent Nick Memphis
of the FBI.
What? That's gotta be wrong.
Now, the only reasonable question to ask after that is, uh,
what the fuck is going on?
Great shot!
-[man] All yours, Dan! -[man 1] Good shooting!
I'm beginning to think that you were the wrong man for the job.
Think what you want.
It appears we misjudged the gunnery sergeant.
There's always a confused soul
that thinks that one man can make a difference.
And you have to kill him to convince him otherwise.
That's the hassle with democracy.
[man] Pull!
[Purnell] …fire under their asses, you understand me?
We need those results now.
Anna, you guys, you take the team… Anna! To the roadhouse.
Okay, I don't care who it is right now. I don't give…
Guys! We got Memphis on the line.
Start a trace.
Got it. I'm on it.
Nick. Hey, it's Howard here. How are you?
Things have gotten a little complicated. I got Bob Lee Swagger in custody.
Yeah, turns out he's not dead, Howard.
Yeah, I know. Word of that possibility had begun to reach us.
Got him.
Were you in a gunfight in Virginia last night?
Like I said, things have gotten a little complicated.
Well, obviously the best thing for you would be to bring him in, right?
I know, I can't do that.
Why?
It's gotten too deep. It's not clear who can be trusted.
But we're the FBI, son. Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I'll keep in touch.
Oh, Nick, wait…
Son of a bitch.
-Did we get that? -Got him.
-Let's move. -They're on an interstate
-outside Bozeman, Montana. -Let's move!
This is Swagger.
Colonel Johnson here. Figured you'd be listening.
It appears you have nowhere to go. [Swagger] Colonel?
If it is "Colonel"?
It is.
I have something you want. Well, it seems so do I.
[beeps] [Sandor] Over the Eritrean border, there is a mass grave with 400 bodies.
Men, women, children.
Tell you what, I'll give it to you and we'll call it even.
I just want someone there I can trust.
I'm amenable. Who do you have in mind?
How about that guy from U2 with the glasses?
Friend of Nelson Mandela and all. He seems trustworthy.
Bono? You want them to get Bono?
My colleague's questioning my choice. Okay,
I see how that could be a tough problem. You know, last minute and all.
How about six-term senator Charles Meachum
from Montana?
Seems like a pretty good second choice, don't you think?
I don't think so.
I'm gonna provide you with two numbers, then we'll talk.
Point 732. Point 648.
And what the hell is that?
Those are the last three digits, down to a few meters of latitude and longitude,
of an oil pipeline pumping station in Eritrea
with 400 bodies underneath.
Where are we meeting?
Somewhere I can see you,
coming from a goddamn long way off.
Where's your boy?
Well, I'm here.
He's here.
Look, look, look.
There's your boy. There's your boy, baby.
Come on, come on. Look, look. Look up.
Okay.
I think I broke a rib!
Don't move!
Is there anybody else?
No.
He head-shoots me, spasm kills her!
You got no shot!
No shot, Swagger! You hear that, Swagger?
You got no shot!
What are you gonna do? Come on!
[Payne] It's over for you, buddy!
No shot! Okay, fuck him.
Not bad!
Pretty good! He went for the shot.
Christ.
[Turner] How can we help you?
Guest at the motel last night gave me $100
to bring this by here at 3:00 p.m.
Let's move!
You all right?
Yeah.
Search him.
[Meachum] I don't carry a weapon,
ordinarily.
[Meachum] I'm licensed to carry that in this state.
Pull the pilot.
[Memphis] Put your weapon down! Put it down!
Put your gun down!
Easy. Easy.
Sarah.
Give me the gun.
It's okay. Give me the gun.
You okay?
[Memphis] Put them up. Keep them up.
Nice shooting, Gunny.
Yeah, you got what you came for.
I think it's time you owe us your side of the bargain.
You do, huh?
Yes, I do, son. I certainly do.
Why don't we think about all this that has gone on
just as a preamble?
You got any plans after this?
You have a rather unique skill set. I'd be interested in offering you a job.
Work? For you?
It's not really as bad as it seems. It's all gonna be done in any case.
You might as well be on the side that gets you well-paid for your efforts.
And what side are you on?
There are no sides. There's no Sunnis and Shiites.
There's no Democrats and Republicans.
There's only haves and have-nots.
What exactly does working for you entail, Senator, huh?
Raping and murdering innocent women and children, you sick fuck?
You sanctioned the mass murder of an entire village
so a pipeline could go through.
One village!
And it brought stability to the region.
Which means that no one chops off their arms
because their grandmother's grandfather
belonged to a different tribe.
They like us down there, boy.
This is a country
where the Secretary of Defense
can go on TV
and tell the American public,
oh, that, "This is about freedom! It's not about oil!"
And nobody questions him,
because they don't want to hear the answer
because it's a lie!
There's only so many places at the table, Gunny.
Now are you on the inside,
or are you on the out?
It's the FBI!
It's gonna be okay. Hold this.
[Sandor] If one of them betrays the principles of the accrual…
I don't think so, Senator.
What are you doing? Saving our lives.
That proved you were innocent! Nobody out here is innocent!
This stuff's plutonium. Nobody can handle it without dying.
You hand it over to the authorities, it's just gonna disappear, along with us!
Unless you want to get buried in the hills outside Terlingua.
I'm out, old man!
I'm just a peckerwood who lives in the hills with too many guns.
You happy?
Where do you think you're going?
Washington!
You going to shoot a sitting U.S. senator in the back?
Lord knows I want to.
I didn't think so.
[Swagger] Let him go.
They've got your rifle.
From the beginning, they've always had your rifle.
Recovered at the site.
You can talk as much as you want, but in the end,
you're going to die by lethal injection,
and I'm going to go back to what I was doing.
I won.
You lost.
Get used to the idea, son.
I'm not your son.
[agent 1] Drop your weapons! Put it down now! [agent 2] Don't move!
Special Agent Nick Memphis, FBI! Don't shoot!
-[agent 2] On the ground! -[agent 1] Down, now!
I said get down!
Could I free my hands, please? It's okay.
Thank you, sir.
-Thanks for bringing her. -Mmm-hmm.
Hey. I'm sorry about everything.
It's not your fault. It is what it is.
This is Attorney General Russert.
Director Brandt. Sir.
Senator Meachum couldn't be with us today.
I'm sure we can manage without him.
Sergeant Swagger, you asked for this meeting.
Against my better judgment, I've agreed to it as a favor to the FBI.
What the hell am I doing here?
You've got nothing on me. I'm covered.
Call the Joint Chief.
That won't be necessary, Colonel,
as I have already received no less than a dozen calls
from highly-ranked and powerfully-placed individuals
telling me to let you go.
But the joy of checks and balances in our government is that I can,
and am, indeed, required by law,
to tell them to fuck off.
This is about evidence and finding out the truth,
so you sit there and be quiet.
Sergeant, you've got five minutes.
Thank you.
This is my weapon.
No question about it, don't deny it.
You recovered it at the scene moments after the assassination.
We agree?
It's been in the FBI's possession ever since,
hasn't been tampered with in any way?
No. Absolutely not.
You fire the weapon? There was no point.
The slug was mangled beyond recognition.
It was, however, an exact metallurgical match.
Right. Definitely my bullets.
Definitely my gun.
Special Agent Memphis, you believe I shot that Archbishop?
Nope. No, I don't.
Have any proof of this fact? No.
-Trust me? -Yep.
Really trust me?
Yeah.
With your life?
Yep. Good.
What the hell are you doing? Put that weapon down now!
If you're zeroed for 600, you ought to aim a little lower.
Ain't gonna make a difference this close.
Only thing that's gonna make a difference
is whether I'm crazy or not.
I could keep doing this all day,
with every weapon in my house.
I swapped all the firing pins before I left the house. I always do.
Looks right, need a micrometer to tell.
But the gun don't shoot.
That bullet you got out of that bishop was fired from my weapon,
but a week before, at a can of stew.
I did take an oath to defend this country from all enemies, foreign and domestic.
I just didn't figure I'd end up quite this involved.
But at the end of the day, when all the dust settles,
you can't hide from the truth, you son of a bitch.
Whatever.
Who gives a shit?
Nice presentation.
But none of it sticks to me.
Gentlemen, this meeting is over.
Done.
I'll be seeing you.
He's right. There's nothing to prove he did anything.
Yeah, in this country.
Sir, you should take a look at these.
These images are from a classified file showing a village of people in Africa
that were exterminated by the colonel and his associates.
[Russert] My God.
Look around you.
This isn't the Horn of Africa.
That's all hearsay.
This is the land of the free and the home of the brave.
And I'm free to go.
[Russert] Colonel, your moral compass is so fucked up,
I'll be shocked if you manage to find your way back to the parking lot.
Regardless of how I feel about this,
these events occurred in another country,
outside of our laws.
So that's it? That's the best you can do?
This isn't the World Court, Sergeant.
And I don't have the jurisdiction to detain the colonel
for crimes he may or may not have committed on another continent.
Sir, I urge you to reconsider-- There's nothing to reconsider, son.
I win.
You lose.
Again.
This is ridiculous.
For the record, I don't like the way this turned out any more than you do.
But this is the world we live in.
And justice does not always prevail.
It's not the Wild West,
where you can clean up the streets with a gun.
Even though sometimes that's exactly what's needed.
Bob Lee Swagger, you're free to go.
Unshackle the sergeant.
[Johnson] I'd say that's quite a shot, Senator.
[Meachum] In the face.
You heard that expression,
"You didn't know whether to shit or go blind"?
You should've seen the look on the Attorney General's face.
Did he give his checks-and-balances speech?
"This is about evidence and the truth!"
And then you just said to him,
"Fuck you!"
"Hold my cigar, Mr. A.G."
"Fuck you!
"The truth is what I say it is!"
You know, you got to be out of the country in the morning.
You're going to Ecuador.
Well, we're having some problems with the locals.
We have our personnel on the ground ready to neutralize the problem, but…
Well, they've requested you.
It's solvable.
They requested you--
Swagger.
Turn off the lights!
Get my car.
Get my car.
[whispers] Do something.
Do something!
Where is he?
He's under the floor! [gunshot]
You don't need to kill me.
You don't need to kill me. It was them.
It was them.
God damn it! Just wait a minute!
Hold it just a minute. Hold it.
Are you out of your mind? Are you out of your damn mind?
I remember everything.
[Dr. Hirsch] Captain Webb.
Good morning.
Has everything been explained to you?
Yes, sir.
When we are finished with you, you will no longer be David Webb.
I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir.
[echoing] You knew exactly what it meant for you
if you chose to stay.
You can't outrun what you did, Jason.
You made yourself into who you are.
Eventually you're gonna have to face the fact.
You volunteered.
Christian Dassault made a reservation.
Heather Lee.
[control deck officer] Ma'am, we have a device
issued to a stay-behind team in Novosibirsk, Russia, in 1993.
Marked on our inventory as destroyed.
It's knocking on our front door.
What's the status?
Whoever it is, is just sitting there idle.
[man] There's no outbound traffic, nothing.
Move.
-[beeping] -They've found a back door.
We need the reverse shell. I'm gonna locate the source.
I'm working on it.
Okay, people, we have a major breach of our classified mainframe.
Drop everything you're doing, get on it right now!
Ma'am, I'm sending you the shell.
Got it.
[woman] Need it right now? [man] Yeah.
[woman] Getting IP. [man] Where's that traceroute?
[woman] Unknown user. Monitoring.
Reykjavik.
SecOps hacking camp.
Kill the power to the building.
[control deck officer] Get into that power grid now.
[cyber technician] Yes, sir.
I've got the power to the building. [Lee] Stand by.
[man 1] Ten seconds.
[man 2] Let's get on top of this.
-Shut it down. -[cyber technician] Copy that. Shutting it down.
Dewey.
We've just been hacked.
How badly?
Could be worse than Snowden.
Is there any attribution?
We're working on it.
Lee says it must be someone with a deep knowledge of our systems.
This could affect Deep Dream, and Iron Hand.
I want a briefing in my conference room in one hour.
Yes.
-Did you get confirmation? -Yeah, there was a hack.
So are we exposed?
We don't know yet. We're checking.
I want you to call Dewey. Set up a meet in DC.
Aaron, we got a lot at stake here,
-maybe we shouldn't rock the boat. -Just do it.
Hey, George. We ready for the launch?
Heather, you know the Director of National Intelligence?
Heather Lee, Cyber Ops, sir.
Have you got a name for us?
The hacker was a former Agency operative.
Believed to be working with Christian Dassault,
and previously linked to Jason Bourne.
Bourne?
-Jesus Christ. -What did they get?
[Lee] Black-ops files.
From Treadstone all the way to Iron Hand.
Iron Hand?
But that's not even operational yet, for Christ's sakes.
Where is Nicky Parsons right now?
On the move.
She left Reykjavik, traveling through Bucharest to Athens.
Feels like a meet to me.
Well, how are you going to handle it?
We cut the head off this thing.
Sir, I'd like to be point on this operation.
You're not indoctrinated for this material.
[Lee] I'm already into it.
I embedded malware into Parsons' download.
When those files are opened, I can trace them.
Let me in.
I'll deliver Parsons, the files,
and, if he's out there, I'll give you Bourne, too.
Excuse me.
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but do not push your personal agenda to the DNI again.
Understood.
All right. I think you can help me.
I'm going to give you full operational control on this,
and I will make sure you have access to any relevant teams and resources.
And I want to know every move you make.
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.
Yeah?
I need your help, now.
I'm not finished here.
Jason Bourne is in play.
-Where? -Athens.
Close your account in Rome.
Understood.
Lee got a hit from a CCTV feed.
Parsons boarded a bus a half-hour ago, headed west across Athens.
I got two local teams en route.
-Any sign of Bourne? -Not so far.
He's involved in this somehow. I can feel it.
Upload all Athens data and feeds,
and activate real-time processing.
[man 1] Copy that.
Where are we?
Parsons' bus has just arrived at Syntagma Square.
There's a demonstration in front of the Greek parliament building.
I think she'll use it as cover.
Deploy Alpha and Bravo to the square.
Recon for Parsons in the crowd outside parliament,
and any possible rendezvous points.
Copy that, sir.
Sir, the Asset has landed.
Alpha Team arriving now.
Copy that.
I have the Alpha Team feeds.
Pull them up.
Athens police are reporting tactical teams moving on the demonstrators.
Isolate all social-media posts from the square.
Yes, ma'am.
Rewind Alpha One's feed.
Yes, ma'am. Twenty seconds.
What's wrong?
I hacked the Agency.
For Christian Dassault.
I got all the black-ops files.
We're putting them online.
We need to move.
Stop.
Two seconds forward.
Blonde hair.
Enhance.
Find her.
[operator] Parsons sighted in Syntagma Square. Redirect south on Stadiou.
I told you, Christian Dassault is going to get you killed.
We don't have a choice, Jason.
It's started again. A new program.
Iron Hand. It's even worse than before.
What's that got to do with me?
Because it matters. It matters.
Not to me, it doesn't.
All that matters is staying alive.
You get off the grid, survive.
I don't believe that and neither do you.
Look at yourself.
Look at what you're doing.
You can't live like this for much longer.
Jason, I came here because I found something.
I found your father's name in the Treadstone files.
He was an analyst.
He wasn't in Operations. He wasn't near any of that stuff.
I'm telling you what I saw. It looked like he was involved directly.
And there's more.
More about you. What do you mean?
Before you joined the program, they were watching you.
Watching me?
You've tortured yourself for a long time now, Jason.
You torture yourself for what you've done.
But you don't know the truth about what they did to you.
You need to read those files.
[Bourne] Move. They tracked you.
Alpha One has eyes on two targets. One female, one male.
Identify the male. Copy that, sir.
Alpha One, we need an ID on the male target.
We've got to get out of here before the police cut off this part of the city.
Head north.
Meet me at the statue of Athena.
I'll take them with me.
That's him.
Now.
Stay with Bourne.
Clear to engage the target.
[man 3] Copy.
Alpha Team, stay with the male. You are clear to engage.
Come on.
Sir, Alpha Team comms are down.
We've lost him, sir. He's taken them out.
Find Parsons. He'll come back to get her.
Sir, rioting is spreading.
The Greek government is declaring a state of emergency.
[female operator] Bravo Team, we are retargeting Parsons.
We got her.
Split the team, put her in a box.
A suspect matching Bourne's description has stolen a police motorcycle.
He's coming for Parsons.
Where the hell is the Asset? Two minutes out, sir.
Parsons is at the statue of Athena.
Copy that.
[man 3] Bravo Team is down.
[man 4] Sir, the Asset is arriving on scene.
[Lee] Pull up the dash cam. [man 3] Copy.
Give me the feed and direct comms to the Asset.
[Asset] Engaging targets.
[Lee] I'm accessing Athens police tactical data.
I need eyes overhead.
Bring up the satellite suite.
Sir, I'm showing a Misty and a KH-12 satellite available.
-Light up the 12. -Yes, sir.
Satellite video feed is online.
[Lee] Police have blocked the road to the north.
The target will be forced to turn left.
[Lee] Another barricade in 200 meters.
Target turning left again.
Bourne's heading for the alley.
Left at the top of the hill.
Stairway.
Up the hill. Heading east.
Give me a strike point.
[Lee] He's found a way out.
Two hundred meters to your left.
Nineteen Solomou. Get to the roof.
Target should pass within your line of sight.
Nineteen Solomou. Copy.
Focus the satellites on these coordinates.
And give me a lock on the motorcycle when it gets there.
Copy that.
I've got the targets. They're approaching Omonia from Fidiou.
Look west.
The long boulevard.
Coming at you in 55 seconds.
Copy that.
[man 4] The Asset is online.
Target's with you in 15 seconds.
Five seconds.
Contact.
Stay low!
Find a shot.
Hold on!
[woman] Targets are down.
Where's Bourne?
Ma'am, a police helicopter spotted three bodies on the roof near the Asset.
A tactical team's on its way.
Nicky?
[Bourne] Don't move!
Athens police have entered the building.
Asset, you need to get out of there.
Negative.
We don't even know if Bourne's alive.
You want to lose this guy?
This is Director Dewey.
You have 20 seconds.
Hold on, Nicky.
I'm going to get you to cover.
[weakly] No.
No.
No, don't.
I'm coming.
-Get a location on Christian Dassault. -Yes, sir.
[Director Dewey] If he was working with Nicky Parsons, he will lead us to Jason Bourne.
And let me know if you get a hit on that malware.
Sir, can I clarify one thing?
Yeah.
Does the Asset know Bourne?
Why would you ask me that?
His behavior on the rooftop.
It suggested a connection.
The last time Bourne came back, he exposed the Blackbriar program.
It compromised active operations.
The Asset was in Syria undercover.
He was captured, tortured,
and it took two damn years to get him out.
So you think that's why Bourne wants the files?
To go public again?
I have no idea why he came back.
But whatever he's doing, he wants to destroy us.
We can't let that happen.
So, you give me a call soon as you hear anything.
Yes, sir.
[woman, on speaker] And now, the founder and chairman of Deep Dream,
Aaron Kalloor.
Hi.
You all know why we're here. We're gonna be unveiling a new platform.
We think it is a bold new step to allow us to serve our community better.
We're a community right now that is transcending national boundaries.
And I think we're 1.5 billion users.
In a nutshell, as you know, we have an ecosystem
of hundreds of thousands of apps at this point.
And what this new platform will do
will be to integrate users' data and preferences,
and use that information
to enrich and tailor-make each unique user experience
in a way that is, frankly, unprecedented.
Um, now, I can see some journalists' pens twitching,
-ready to ask about privacy. -[man] Yeah.
This is a concern to many people, and so it should be.
I mean, this is something that matters to us.
And let me just say, uh,
I understand nobody wants to feel like they're being watched.
So let me just tell you,
when you come to Deep Dream, when you use our service,
no one will be watching you.
-[Maitre D'] Mr. Kalloor. -[waitress] Right this way, sir.
[waitress] Enjoy your meal.
[Aaron] Thank you.
[Director Dewey] Congratulations.
I hear your stockholders were very happy with that new platform.
And I heard you got hacked.
We're dealing with it.
This changes everything. There's too much risk.
I'm out.
Aaron,
you are an extraordinarily gifted and perceptive young man.
When you agreed to help us,
it was because you understood the very grave threats that...
Do you have any idea of the shit-storm I'll have on my hands
if this arrangement becomes public?
I already took a hit with Snowden, and you want more?
Our enemies have become much more sophisticated.
Gathering metadata is no longer adequate.
We need a back door into your new platform,
and a way past the encryptions.
And when that's not enough, you'll want something new.
You don't get it, do you?
Privacy is freedom.
Maybe that's something you should think about defending.
You little prick, you didn't believe in privacy or freedom
when we funded your startup, turned you into a billionaire.
I have paid you back many, many, many times over.
And I was never comfortable with any of this.
I'm out.
I'm done selling out our customers.
But you would sell out your country.
The truth is, we wouldn't be having this conversation
if you didn't feel personally at risk.
You talk about a free Internet, you tell yourself you're saving the world,
but all you're doing is making it a much more dangerous place.
And you're sure as hell making this country much more difficult to defend.
And you're sure as hell accountable for that, Aaron.
Accountable.
Bourne?
Everything on the table.
Open it.
Sure.
[Lee, on phone] Bourne has surfaced.
In Berlin.
Get the Berlin team up.
Where is she?
She's dead.
She knew the risks.
I warned her.
She made a choice.
You exploited her.
Berlin team is mobile.
What do we have on the location?
It's an address linked to Christian Dassault.
Anything on Bourne?
Nothing yet. I'm accessing CCTV now.
Sir, I've been thinking, maybe we've got this wrong.
What if he's not coming for us?
What if it's something else?
You don't have any idea who you're dealing with.
We should work together, Bourne.
You exposed the Blackbriar program.
We're both after the same thing, right?
We both want to take down the corrupt institutions that control society.
I'm not on your side.
CCTV feed is online.
He's on a computer.
We have to stop this.
If he puts those files online,
operations will be compromised and people will die.
Yes, sir.
At least when you're done, leave me the files.
These programs have to be exposed.
People have a right to know.
We need that computer.
There's a phone in the room.
I can use it to delete the files.
-Got the phone. -Where's that team?
[Jeffers] Five minutes out, sir.
[man] We're running out of time. Get there.
[Richard] Listen to me, David.
I've done something.
Something...
...that came at a cost.
One day you'll understand why.
I gotta get back to Washington.
I love you, son.
They're fighting, sir.
One more firewall.
Files deleted, sir.
[Director Dewey] Call in.
[Lee] Bourne, my name is Heather Lee.
I'm not in charge here.
I wasn't here when you went missing.
I can see you're going through the old Treadstone files.
Retracing your history.
I know you're looking for something.
Let me help you find it.
Give me that phone.
Yes, sir.
Jason, this is Robert Dewey. Do you remember me?
Jason, your dad was a patriot.
He could see the threats that America was facing,
and, like you, he chose to serve his country
out of a profound sense of duty.
He would not want to see you harm the Agency.
You have to stop this.
And you have to stop it now.
Sir, our ETA is...
[woman] He's on the move. Be ready.
[man 1] Take point!
On me!
[man 2] The elevator.
We lost him, sir.
Malcolm Smith, contract only, based out of London.
Ran all of Treadstone's surveillance in the late '90s,
when Bourne was recruited.
[Russell] Is he still active?
[Jeffers] He's private security now.
[Director Dewey] Contact the Asset
and tell him I want him on the ground in London in six hours.
I think that could be a mistake, sir.
A mistake? Why?
There is an argument for catching Bourne instead of killing him.
All right, let's hear it.
Bourne's been off the grid for a long time.
He's been hiding in the shadows, he's seen things.
He knows things that could help us.
Bringing him back in is the smart move.
And how are we going to do that?
Albert Hirsch wrote a psych evaluation when Bourne left the program.
He concluded Bourne is still a patriot at heart,
and that leaving the program could come back to haunt him.
And what are you suggesting?
I watched Bourne with those files.
Desperately looking into his past.
And I think he's at a tipping point.
If I could get face-to-face with him,
I think I can bring him back in.
One attempt.
And if it fails,
you do what you have to.
Well, it makes sense to me. What do you think, Bob?
Let's give it a shot.
All right, do it.
Bring Bourne in, or tie it off.
But this ends now. [Lee] Thank you, sir.
Sir, I'm sorry...
No, don't worry about that.
Better get some sleep, kid. [chuckles]
You got a long 24 hours ahead of you.
Yes, sir.
[Aaron] It's taking too long.
It shouldn't still be buggy this close to launch.
Well, I don't think it's buggy.
I think we've changed some things that's going to have to change the parameters.
We're going to have to go and-- Okay, well, we need to change them back.
Amanda, can we get that note over to Kyle?
Absolutely.
Look, I think you're right,
-I just don't think we want to-- -I'm tired of waiting.
Mr. Kalloor.
What the hell is this?
Mr. Kalloor, my name is John Burroughs.
I'm from the Department of Justice.
I'm hereby serving you with the enclosed complaint--
-Really? We have to do this in public? -Issued by the US government
against Deep Dream Corporation for violation of the Sherman Act.
This complaint requires you to preserve all personal and corporate financial records
pending antitrust motions to be filed in federal court.
Good day.
-This is Dewey. -Aaron,
it's a message.
And maybe we should think about what we're doing
before it gets any worse.
So, you think if we give him what he wants, it'll end there?
No, I'm just saying that maybe we should listen.
I want you to pull up all the records of all the meetings I've ever had with Dewey.
All the records? Even the off-the-books discussions?
Especially those.
We're going to Vegas. I need an insurance policy.
Yeah.
[Director Dewey] Are you in London?
[Asset] Yes.
Why are you sending her?
She serves a purpose.
I work alone.
Not this time.
Don't make this personal.
Bourne betrayed us. It's always been personal.
You know who you're dealing with.
You better make sure you're ready.
Yeah.
[Bauman] There's something you should know about Deep Dream.
But I need an assurance
that I have your support.
You got it. What do you have?
Kalloor
is planning something for Vegas.
Yes?
This is Jason Bourne.
I need to talk.
What about?
I don't work for the Agency anymore.
Paddington Plaza, 15 minutes.
Bourne just called Smith.
They're meeting at Paddington Plaza.
15 minutes.
We'll tail Smith the whole way.
As soon as we get eyes on Bourne, I'll approach him.
Whatever you do, stay contained.
I don't want the Brits crawling all over us, asking questions.
Understood.
Tracking device.
You'll hold on the south side of the bridge.
I'll contact you if I need you.
Sure.
You're the boss, right?
Subject is on the move. Heading toward the canal.
Alpha Team, take a parallel track.
Bravo Team follow the subject from behind.
And keep your eyes open for Bourne.
Bravo Team tailing subject.
Let's go.
In 200 meters, make a right.
[agent] Copy that.
Comms check. Second channel. Do you copy?
I have you. Where are you now?
Heading towards Smith.
No sign of Bourne.
Subject has turned east,
into an alley.
Alpha Team,
that alley leads to a footbridge, which will bring him to you.
Copy that.
Bravo Team is down.
Sending you updated route now.
You copy that, Smith?
Yes.
Bravo Team, why aren't you moving? What's going on?
Bravo Team, do you copy?
What's happening, Heather? Where's Bravo?
We're comms down on Bravo.
Alpha Team, do you have eyes on the subject?
We have eyes on.
Alpha Team, sit-rep.
Alpha Team, report.
What's happening, Heather?
Alpha Team isn't responding.
Bravo?
Still nothing.
You lost both teams? Get a grip on this operation, Heather.
That's Bourne.
Green-light the Asset.
Sir, I need more time.
We have no time.
Are you going to give that order or not?
Sir, please.
You are too naive to see the truth.
There's no bringing in Bourne.
He has to be put down,
and you obviously cannot do what has to be done.
I am taking operational control.
Asset, you have a green light.
Repeat, you have a green light on Bourne.
Copy that.
I'm on my way.
Asset, are you on the move?
Asset, your tracking device says you're stationary.
Are you moving?
Heather, stay off this channel. Let him do his job.
Left here.
-Get to Paddington Plaza, fast. -[agent] Copy that.
[Asset] In position.
Locked in.
What's going on?
What's that noise?
Multiple fire alarms.
That's Bourne.
What do I do?
You stay there. You do not move.
[man, over speaker] Leave the building by the nearest available exit.
I can't stay here.
You can't protect me.
I need you to stay where you are, Smith.
You still have line of sight?
I'm on him.
You're gonna shoot him
in a crowd when he's right next to me?
Stay where you are, Smith.
You know why he's here.
He wants answers.
You've lost this thing.
I gotta get out of here.
Shit!
What the hell is going on?
Bourne's got Smith.
Go after them. I'll come around and cut them off.
Smith, we know you're with Bourne.
You have to find a way to let us know where you are.
Why are you taking me in here?
They've got to be near the Plaza.
[Smith] Jesus, Bourne!
[grunts] God damn it!
What are you doing? Take it easy.
Richard Webb.
Station Chief, Beirut.
He was my father. He started Treadstone.
He hired you to put me under surveillance. Why?
-Jesus! -Why did he hire you?
Don't say anything, Smith.
No. No.
There's no sign of them.
What do you want us to do?
Work your way down the canal.
I'll circle around and meet you there.
You followed me to Beirut.
The last time I saw my father!
Why would he have you follow me?
It doesn't make any sense. Why?
Don't give him a goddamn thing.
Why?
Jesus Christ, Bourne! I'm falling!
Bourne, please!
I can hear them!
Beirut.
I went there to tell him that Treadstone had approached me.
But if it was his program, why didn't he say anything to me?
I've done something.
Something...
...that came at a cost.
That was the day he was killed.
They said he was killed by terrorists.
He wasn't killed by terrorists, was he?
Think about your family's safety, Smith. You keep your mouth shut.
The next bullet's in your head!
Why was he killed?
Why?
He was killed because of you.
Your father, he wasn't in Operations.
He didn't know we'd chosen you. When he found out, he...
He threatened to expose the program.
He didn't want you turned into a killer.
Who killed him?
Who killed him?
Don't do it.
Where is he?
He's almost there.
We're gonna stop this now.
No, please.
[man] Somebody help! Call an ambulance!
[woman] Someone help!
[Asset] He went off the roof. Five floors.
He recognized me.
I'm going to make sure it's finished.
[man] Help's coming now.
No, don't get up, mate.
Step aside, please. Step aside.
[policewoman] Everybody step back.
-[policeman] Let us do our job. -[policewoman] Please step back.
Did anybody see what happened? He's gone.
-Oh, shit. -I'm going after him.
I'll work my way down the canal.
No. You're done in London.
What are you talking about?
There's another play to be made.
Now that he knows what we did, he'll come for both of us,
and that could be the opportunity for something else.
This isn't about revenge.
[Asset] Yes, it is.
And it won't be done until one of us is dead.
[Director Dewey] Get to the airport.
We have a problem with Iron Hand.
Copy that.
Give me a sit-rep.
[agent] We've got nothing.
Keep looking.
Drive.
It wasn't supposed to go like this. I wanted to talk.
Where's Dewey going?
He's going to Vegas to speak with Aaron Kalloor at a cyber convention.
The Agency recruits there every year.
What's Iron Hand?
Dewey's new black-ops program.
Full-spectrum surveillance.
Watching everyone all the time.
Dewey needs Kalloor's cooperation to bring it online.
Let me out.
I can help you get there.
Why would you do that?
You and I have different reasons, but we both want Dewey gone.
Here, take this.
I'll see you in Vegas.
Sir.
[Jeffers] We're pinning Kalloor's hit on a fictional jihadi shooter.
A 20-year-old Iraqi national.
We created bank accounts, travel documents, e-mails, phone records.
He'll look like a lone wolf. Any physical evidence?
The Asset leaves the gun. It'll have the Iraqi's prints on it.
Russell doesn't need to know about this.
I understand, sir.
Any news on Bourne?
Nothing.
He was always gonna come for me.
Well, if it happens, we'll deal with it.
What was the purpose of your visit to London, Mr. Michaels?
Business.
[officer] Welcome home, sir.
Thank you.
[man, on radio] Parking lot clear. You're good to go.
Sir, we have a secure room for you, right upstairs.
-Enjoy your stay. -Thank you.
Hi, welcome to the Aria.
-Heather Lee, checking in. -Okay.
We have you in a lovely Sky Suite. Number 2016.
Enjoy your stay.
Thank you.
[man 1] Aaron!
[man 2] All right, Aaron! [man 3] Deep Dream!
Find Lee.
Tell her I want to see her before we go on stage.
Yes, sir.
I want agents posted backstage as well as the auditorium.
Yes, sir.
[guard 1] Coming through, make a hole.
Make a hole, make a hole.
[Aaron] Gonna make a quick stop here.
Hey, guys. Hi. How's it going? Aaron.
Good to meet you.
Can I get one?
Thanks very much for your hard work.
Thank you. [Bauman] You're doing a great job.
Yeah.
You all set?
Checking the departure route now.
You won't have much time.
They won't know where it came from. I'll have enough time.
After you take care of Kalloor, I'll be standing, left hand at my side.
You put a bullet in it.
It's better if I'm a target, too.
Copy that.
Lee.
The Director wants a word before you go on stage.
Of course.
ID?
Thanks.
Heather.
My protegee. Strongest supporter.
You know, after what happened in London,
I did not know what to do with you.
I suppose we'll just, um,
write it off to your learning curve.
I'd appreciate that.
[Director Dewey] At least you can now see that you never had a chance.
When Bourne turns up again, I'll deal with him.
Do you understand?
Of course.
I agree completely.
When we get on stage,
I'll handle all the policy questions, throw everything technical to you.
I'll be ready, sir. Okay, let's do this.
[guard] Badges?
Aaron.
Robert.
[Director Dewey] You know Heather Lee.
Yeah, we went to Stanford together.
Wow. How are you enjoying life at the Agency?
Challenging. But fulfilling.
It's tough to stay true to your principles over there?
My principles are just fine, thanks.
[organizer] Gentlemen, we're ready for you. Follow me, please.
I'm going to enjoy this.
So am I.
Thank you, sir.
Oh! Hi! How's everybody doing tonight?
[Bradley] Welcome.
Welcome.
Welcome to tonight's EXOCON Symposium.
We are so lucky to have four fantastic guests this evening.
The CIA Director, Robert Dewey, is here.
And a dear friend of mine, and an old friend of EXOCON,
the CEO of social-media giant Deep Dream, Aaron Kalloor is here.
Tonight, "Policing a free Internet,
personal rights versus public safety."
This is the great question of our time.
And the choices we make about this will determine our future.
So let's just dive right in, okay?
Come on out here, guys.
Sir, you've got an incoming message.
High priority.
All right, guys, I'm gonna have to take this.
I'll catch up with you later.
Go ahead.
Thanks for having me. Hey.
[Bradley] It appears Director Dewey is held up momentarily,
and I am being told that it shouldn't be too much longer.
But we have a ton of stuff to get into tonight,
-so we can start anyway... -[Aaron] Brad?
Brad, could I say a few words?
-Excuse me? -Can I get the ball rolling?
Oh, sure, man, by all means.
Ladies and gentlemen, Aaron Kalloor.
Thank you. Thanks a lot.
Thanks a lot to Brad and all the folks at EXOCON
for having us back,
and to you guys for turning out.
Before the Director comes out to join us,
I just wanted to share a few words with you guys.
A long time ago, I had this idea.
Copy that. [Aaron] A beautiful idea, to create a place, online...
Facial recognition got a hit.
Bourne was on a BA flight from Heathrow to Vegas.
It landed two hours ago.
How the hell did he get through immigration?
Someone issued him an Agency security clearance on his passport.
[Aaron] Well, it turned out to be a pretty popular idea. -[audience laughing] -[Aaron] Um...
People from around the world started using our service.
[Aaron] Well, first off,
this has all made me a lot more rich than is probably healthy.
When I come on stage, take care of Kalloor and the girl.
Copy.
[Aaron] But, what I mean to say is that, you know, all this success has come at a cost.
There is a cancer at the heart of Deep Dream.
A guilty secret, and, um...
I have to share it with all of you guys.
Son of a bitch is about to take us down.
Take out Kalloor and the girl right now.
[man] Whoa, whoa... -Stay there. -Okay.
[Aaron] When I was starting out, I, uh...
I took money to start my company.
Made a bargain with a guy in a dark suit...
...and now he's come back to take my soul.
[agent Vasquez] I see the shooter!
We've got eyes on Jason Bourne.
[Bauman] He's still breathing. Call an ambulance!
-[agent 2] Let's go! -Sir, we gotta go.
This is Vasquez. We're on Bourne.
Get the cars ready!
Get the cars ready right now!
No, take me to the suite.
Sir, we've got to get you out of here. Bourne is on the loose.
You heard me. Take me to the suite.
Yes, sir.
Take him to the suite. Take him upstairs.
Get him upstairs.
Right now. Right now.
Up to the suite.
-Let's go, right now. Go, go, go! -Yes, sir.
Out of the way! Federal agent!
Vasquez, sit-rep.
Vasquez, come in!
Okay, we've got him. Sir, this is Collier.
-We've ID'd the sniper. -Shit.
We're circulating his photo now.
What about Bourne?
Hang on.
Okay, Bourne is just leaving the west service corridor,
heading for the lobby.
Copy that. Stay on Bourne.
What?
[Jeffers] We're still looking for Bourne.
And they've ID'd the Asset.
Go back to the first floor and wait for further instructions.
-Yes, sir. Copy that. -Copy that.
-Everybody down! Right now! -[people screaming]
Down, move, move, move!
Out of the way! Federal agents! Move!
Take a team to the northeast elevators. I'll meet you up there.
Bourne's on his way up to you.
You took a long time to get here, Jason.
I know about Beirut.
I know what you did.
It all ends tonight.
Be a lot easier to do it right away.
You didn't come here for revenge.
You came here because you know it's time to come in.
Your father created the program.
Didn't have what it takes to make it work.
And you did.
You always did.
That's why you volunteered.
I volunteered because I thought our enemies killed him.
I volunteered because of a lie.
No, you volunteered because of who you are.
You volunteered because you are Jason Bourne,
and not David Webb.
Thirty-two kills, Jason.
Every one of them made a difference.
People all across this country are safer because of what you did.
I'm trying to find another way.
And how's that working out for you?
You're never going to find any peace.
Not until you admit to yourself who you really are.
It's time to come in, Jason.
It's time to come in.
I can't.
Not for you.
You were never here.
You don't have to go after him.
This can stop now.
You have a choice.
[officer 1] Let's go! [officer 2] Have your IDs ready.
Have your IDs ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[officer 3] Have your IDs ready! Come on, guys, let's go, let's go!
Stand in a line. Las Vegas Police, ladies and gentlemen!
[female dispatcher] BearCat SWAT truck and unmarked black Dodge Charger
stolen from the front of the Aria.
Pursuit in progress. Air support requested.
[man] What was that ID?
[policeman] Stop him! Block that road!
Move!
[officer, over radio] Next two units involved, identify.
[officer, on helicopter radio] This is Air 1. Be advised, suspect vehicles
have crashed into the southeast entrance of the Riviera.
[dispatch] We have an armed suspect heading into the storm drain south of the Riviera.
You're a traitor. You've always been a traitor.
It's in your blood.
[reporter 1] Mr. Kalloor!
[reporter 2] Aaron! What were you going to tell everyone at the convention?
[reporter 1] What are you hiding, Aaron?
Easy.
Get back. [reporter 3] Why did somebody try to assassinate you?
[reporter 2] What's the cancer at the heart of Deep Dream?
I think it would be inappropriate to pass any comment at this stage,
but I look forward to working with the authorities
to find out who was responsible.
And to getting back to Deep Dream,
where we can continue our important work. Thank you.
[reporter 1] Have you been lying to your users?
Sir.
I wanted to say I'm sorry, sir.
About Vegas.
Director Dewey's tactics were unwise.
Unwise?
We're still trying to come up with a narrative to explain what happened.
That son of a bitch put a spotlight on Iron Hand.
On all of us.
Kalloor hasn't gone public yet.
I know Aaron.
There are still moves we can make with him.
Tell me.
Dewey's problem was that he belonged to the past.
People like Kalloor are shaping the future.
These are my people.
I know how to deal with him.
And what do you want?
When you appoint a new Agency Director,
you're going to need someone working for your interests.
Someone...
Empowered by you.
What about Bourne?
You still think you can bring him in?
I have his trust.
After what we went through.
I'll bring him in.
I'm certain of it.
And if you can't?
Then he'll have to be put down.
It's an interesting proposal.
You can pull over here.
Of course, if you decide that you don't need me,
then that's not a problem.
There are many other agencies who would want what I know.
[Lee] I brought you something.
It's a cast from your father's star,
on the Memorial Wall at Langley.
I'm sorry for what happened to you.
How you were treated.
But the people that did that are gone,
and things are changing at the Agency.
What is it you want?
I know you've always been a patriot.
That what happens to this country matters to you.
We need you to help protect us.
Come back in.
And we'll work together.
Let me think about it.
How will I find you?
[Russell] You still think you can bring him in?
[Lee] I have his trust.
After what we went through.
I'll bring him in.
I'm certain of it.
I know you want this to be over.
I'm right here.
I will be right here...
But, you don't give up.
You hear me?
As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight.
You breathe... keep breathing.
Ah, shit.
Goddamn sumbitches.
The sumbitch got shit for brains.
-You seen Coulter? TRAPPER: Nope.
Listen up! When them plews is cleaned, I want you to hoop 'em up real tight.
When them plews is cleaned, I want you to hoop 'em up real tight.
Remember, we're not doing no 15-pelt bales! -We're doing 30-pelt bales! HENRY: Fitzgerald!
Cap'n.
Where are we with the haul? What are you thinking?
I'm thinking, whatever it is they're hunting out there...
...I hope it don't need another shot.
Make sure we're ready to head out by dawn.
Been done by this morning.
I'd have liked to be out by now, but the men are too tired.
We're only a few days from the fort. We're trapped out.
All we have to worry about is fresh meat for the boys.
Well, you, uh, seen Coulter?
JIM: Hey, we took down an elk. A big one.
We need help to haul the meat back.
Let me know when it's on the spit. I'll help you with it then.
Come on, I need your help.
We needed help when we were loading them bales.
I been eating this damn beaver meat so long...
...I'm starting to miss my wife's cooking.
-I'm starting to miss your wife. -Shut up.
COULTER: Help!
Help.
TRAPPER 1: Is that Coulter?
You go get the Captain.
STUBBY BILL: Jesus Christ.
TRAPPER 2: Anybody see them?
TRAPPER 3: Stay quiet. TRAPPER 4: Watch the ridge.
HAWK [IN PAWNEE]: What was that?
Pa?
Let's go.
[WHISPERS] They got Thomas.
I can't see 'em. I can't see 'em.
HENRY: Get down!
We're surrounded! They're everywhere!
We're surrounded! They're everywhere! HENRY: Stay here! Stay here!
Paul, no!
-They want us out in the open. TRAPPER 3: Someone get him help!
Nobody move! Stay where you are!
They want the pelts.
We got to get on that boat right now or we'll lose it all.
[IN ENGLISH] Get to the boat! To the boat, son! Move!
[IN ENGLISH] Get to the boat! To the boat, son! Move! Move, move!
Leave the furs! Leave the furs! To the boat!
Hawk!
Hawk!
Hawk!
Grab some pelts! Come on, grab the pelts!
DAVE: Give this to my little girl.
You're coming with us. I'll get help.
GLASS: Leave the furs! Leave the pelts!
Willman!
Get to the boat!
Fucking savage!
Get on the fucking boat!
HENRY: Cut the rope! Cut the rope!
Wait for Amos!
No! We go now!
Fire the cannon!
AMOS: Don't leave! Wait!
[IN ARIKARA] My daughter, Powaqa, is not here.
Collect all the pelts we can carry.
We'll trade pelts with the French for horses and keep searching for her.
HENRY: --and dust becomes flour...
...and when the morning is clear... ...this child of God will meet Jesus Christ himself. Amen.
MAN 1: Amen. MAN 2: Amen.
HENRY: You ready?
Hold still.
ANDERSON: Where did you learn that?
My father was a doctor. Bridger!
FITZGERALD: Captain, we got a swarm of tree niggers... ...out here waiting to finish the job.
...out here waiting to finish the job.
Tell me you got some kind of plan.
Glass?
Missouri's no good.
Not while the Ree's running it.
We got to get off this boat.
Oh, you want to get off the boat?
Then what do we do, huh?
Take our furs and sit out there amongst the Ree like a bunch of ducks?
Only safe thing to do is track a new course back up on land.
That'll add weeks to the trip.
Better than floating where they can get eyes on us.
They got eyes on you right now, son.
What I'm saying is we stay on the boat. Chart a course toward the fort and take our chances on the water.
Chart a course toward the fort and take our chances on the water.
Glass knows this territory best. It's his job to get us home safe.
-Get us home safe? -Yeah.
FITZGERALD: Need I remind you we already lost 32 men?
It's 33 now. They were my men, Fitzgerald. I know how many I lost.
We do like Glass says. That's the end of it.
GLASS: We have to set the boat loose. If the Ree are tracking us, they'll find it downriver.
Best course is to hike inland to the Grand and follow it to Fort Kiowa.
On foot? It'll be winter before we get there.
Yeah, unless we come across a post, trade for some horses.
Ain't no posts that far over!
Captain, losing this boat is a goddamn mistake.
The Ree ain't that stupid.
We keep it, we can lay it up around Arrow's Peak.
Quit acting like you know what you're talking about.
Ain't nobody talking to you. Who'd listen to you anyway?
Can't find your way out of your breeches to take a shit.
All I'm saying is Camp Rhulen is just up the way.
We can hole up there.
We walk.
Yeah, I'm sure we will.
Wish my dad was a doctor. Then he could've bought me a captain's job.
What do we do, eh?
Pray these pelts ain't rotten if we ever get back here?
HENRY: Make sure to mark this place. We're leaving a fortune under these rocks.
HENRY: Make sure to mark this place. We're leaving a fortune under these rocks. Glass, chart a course.
Glass, chart a course.
Tightest you can that gets us around the Ree.
Yes, sir.
FITZGERALD: This ain't right.
We all know these furs ain't gonna be here by the time we come back.
There's no way we can haul them all the way to the fort.
Arikara are all through the territory. We'll want our hands free.
We're gonna lose those pelts.
-You rather keep the pelts or your life? -Life?
What life you talking about? I ain't got no life.
I just got living and the only way I get that is through these pelts.
Fuck!
Ain't no way I'm going home after six months working my ass off like a mule...
...risking my neck, men dying, and for what?
Damn near lost everything. Job's been fucked from the start!
There's the one been fucking us.
You wonder how the Ree got the dead drop on us...
...when Mr. Glass was supposed to look out for that very thing?
All them Pawnee buddies of his.
Pawnee's as much against the Ree as the rest of us.
Yeah?
Well, what about his little half-breed son?
What kind of savage you think his mama was?
Oh, lay off the boy, Fitz.
All I'm saying is...
...a savage is savage.
Hey, Glass...
...is it true what they say... ...about you shooting a lieutenant while living with them savages?
...about you shooting a lieutenant while living with them savages? HENRY: Fitzgerald.
FITZGERALD: Twenty-one dead soldiers and 40 dead feathernecks.
But you and your boy the only ones to walk out alive. Kind of a miracle.
Kind of a miracle.
HENRY: Shut up, Fitzgerald.
FITZGERALD: Is that what you did?
Shot one of your own to save this little dog here?
Shut up!
Why? Was he playing with this little boy's mama, huh?
HENRY: Fitzgerald! -Did he kill her?
Hey, you can quit polishing that rifle when I'm talking to you.
I'm working on it.
You can work on it when I'm done talking to you. Look at me.
HENRY: That's enough!
You're forgetting your place, boy.
As far as I can tell, my place is here on the smart end of this rifle.
HENRY: You move along, Fitzgerald. That's an order!
Listen! There's only a couple hours of light left. We got to stash these pelts and get rid of the boat.
We got to stash these pelts and get rid of the boat. -Let's go! MAN: Yes, captain.
-Let's go! MAN: Yes, captain.
[IN PAWNEE] I told you to be invisible, son.
At least he...
--If you want to survive, keep your mouth shut.
- At least he hear me... - They don't hear your voice!
They just see the color of your face.
You understand?
Yes.
You have to listen to me, son.
You have to listen.
HENRY: Beckett!
Weston!
JONES: Why are they not jumping?
STUBBY BILL: It looks like they changed their minds.
FITZGERALD: Smart sumbitches. Smart.
I ought to be on that boat.
They did the right thing.
GLASS: It's time to move.
Get up.
We're headed out.
I'm coming.
It's better you lay down.
When the rest of the men are ready you send them to me.
I'm going west.
You are my son.
WARRIOR 1 [IN ARIKARA]: There are only two here.
ELK DOG [IN ARIKARA]: Powaqa is not here.
WARRIOR 1: The others probably took her.
They went north.
ELK DOG: We'll pick up their tracks on the mountain.
HENRY: Was it the right decision? Leaving the boat?
[IN ENGLISH] The Ree own that river. They would've flanked us.
We stay east of the Grand through the mountains...
...we cut a week off our trip.
Lands are bone dry up there. Nothing for the Ree to hunt.
HENRY: Except us.
GLASS: Except us.
Is it true what Fitzgerald said?
Is that why you came out here to the edge of the world?
Glass?
I do like the quiet.
Your boy...
...he's seen a lot.
He got a mother you need to get him back to?
JIM: Mr. Glass!
There are cubs here!
We got cubs here!
Christ Almighty.
He's down here!
ANDERSON: Keep your eyes open. There's bears around.
JIM: I need your help now!
HENRY: Oh, my God.
Get me rags now!
Give me rags before he bleeds out. Rags.
Prepare the kit. Bridger! You hold that.
Easy. Oh, my God.
ANDERSON: Got to give him credit for taking that grizz down with him.
He shouldn't have shot. The place is crawling with tree niggers.
HENRY: That's enough! That's enough! We're still in Ree territory.
HENRY: That's enough! That's enough! We're still in Ree territory. He's one of our own men.
He's one of our own men.
Scout a circle around us. North and west. Take those two with you.
Bill, Fryman, you take south and east.
Watch for anyone that might've heard that shot.
We have to stitch him up.
[IN ENGLISH] What about me? Captain?
You just stay here.
Hold it down.
JIM: I'm so sorry, Mr. Glass. HENRY: Bridger, press down here.
JIM: He's bleeding down here, too.
ANDERSON: They're torturing the bastard.
The proper thing to do would be to finish him off quick.
Unless he has a chance of pulling through.
Pulling through?
You saw what that grizz did to him. -He'll be dead inside an hour. -Mm-hm.
Yeah, we all will be if he don't quit wailing like that.
Toward you and twist it into place. I'll hold him. Go.
-Pa. HENRY: Hold him. Go.
Go!
Now!
He passed out.
I'll take advantage and stitch up his neck.
Water.
Bridger, tell the others we'll camp here tonight.
[IN PAWNEE] I'm right here.
I'll be right here...
[IN FRENCH] Toussaint, he's here.
[IN FRENCH] I thought he wouldn't make it.
I'm glad you made it here.
[IN ARIKARA] We need horses and rifles.
We bring you many pelts.
No horses... just what we agreed.
Take all the pelts you want.
We need horses and rifles.
I need a woman with big tits...
Who can cook.
INTERPRETER [IN ARIKARA]: We can't give you any horses.
TOUSSAINT: What's he saying?
INTERPRETER [IN FRENCH]: I don't know, something about horses.
Bring us something to drink... some whiskey.
Tell him to stop asking about the horses.
Always good doing business with you.
Horses.
No horses.
All we can trade are guns and ammunition.
Tell him if he asks about horses again, there is no deal.
Where did you get these? The Americans?
They're already branded.
I'll only be able to get half price for them.
Get him away from there.
I said no horses.
[IN ARIKARA] We'll take these three horses.
I'm not going to say it again.
They aren't part of the deal.
Now tell your man to step away.
We had an agreement, you have to honor it.
[IN FRENCH] You stand there and talk to me about honor?
INTERPRETER: I told you he speaks French.
Those pelts are stolen.
[IN ARIKARA] You all have stolen everything from us.
Everything!
The land.
The animals.
Two white men snuck into our village, and took my daughter, Powaqa.
We leave you these pelts because honor demands it.
I take your horses to find my daughter.
You are free to try and stop me.
Business is business.
Prepare five horses for them.
HENRY: I want everybody up at the crack of dawn.
Carrying Glass will be hard, so we need to get ahead as far as possible.
We'll divide into two groups.
Fitzgerald, Jones, Fryman, you take the east side of the river.
Anderson, you scout up front.
That claw don't belong to you.
It ain't for me.
Stop!
HENRY: Don't let him down! Don't let him down!
ANDERSON: Watch it.
JONES: How we gonna make it up this?
FITZGERALD: Slow down.
ANDERSON: It's killing us, captain!
HENRY: Lift it, Bridger!
FITZGERALD: Goddamn it, keep it steady.
JIM: Lift it up higher. HAWK [IN ENGLISH]: I am.
JONES: I'll go up and pull.
My foot!
Enough of this shit!
We'll never make it across like this, captain.
He's burning up.
Cap'n, you ain't doing us nor him no favors... ...by letting him go on suffering like this.
Captain, it's all the same up here.
We're gonna have to go back. Find another way.
Glass. Hugh.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Lay that rag over his eyes, Mr. Bridger.
HAWK: What?
HENRY: Lay the rag over his eyes. HAWK: Wait!
HENRY: I'm sorry, Hugh.
JIM: Sir, I can't do that. HAWK: How do we get back without him? Only he knows the way.
HAWK: How do we get back without him? Only he knows the way. HENRY: Lay the rag over his eyes. JIM: I can't.
Wait! How do we get back--
HENRY: Lay it over his eyes!
Step back.
HAWK [IN ENGLISH]: Bridger, stop! Bridger, Henry. Henry! Henry, please.
HAWK [IN ENGLISH]: Bridger, stop! Bridger, Henry. Henry! Henry, please. Captain. Captain. Please. Please leave....
There's a $70 bonus from the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to the two men...
...that stay with Glass to see this through.
HAWK [IN ENGLISH]: I'll stay!
Me too. Money or not, I'll stay.
I'll need a third.
Sorry, captain.
I have a family. I'm not crazy.
Captain, three men can't hold off a party of Ree...
...much less some boys.
Besides, $70 ain't gonna buy nobody a new set of ears.
A hundred, then.
This man is the only reason we're still alive.
We were 45 men when this started. Now we're ten. Almost nine.
HAWK: He's my father. He can have my share.
JIM: Mine too. He can have my share also.
All right. If Mr. Bridger feels the same way, I'll lag behind with them.
If Mr. Bridger feels the same way, I'll lag behind with them.
-You? -Yep.
You already lost my share of the pelts...
...so I got no choice but to make it up by some other means.
Sticking around for another day or two don't make no difference.
$300, at least I get to go home with something.
Glass is to be cared for until, understood?
Yeah. You have my word. I understand.
HENRY: You boys get him down off this slope...
...and somewhere safe before dark.
-Fitzgerald. FITZGERALD: Captain.
Glass is to be cared for as long as necessary.
And a proper burial when it's time.
He's earned it.
I understand.
You hurt yourself?
ANDERSON: I'll be fine.
HAWK [IN PAWNEE]: Can you hear that wind, father?
Remember what mother used to say about the wind?
The wind cannot defeat a tree with strong roots.
You are still breathing...
I miss her so much.
GLASS [IN PAWNEE]: I will be right here...
I'm right here.
As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight.
You breathe. Keep breathing.
WIFE [IN PAWNEE]: When there is a storm...
And you stand in front of a tree...
If you look at the branches, you swear it will fall.
But if you watch the trunk, you will see its stability.
FITZGERALD: Three hundred bucks goes a long way toward retirement.
Go down to Texas, find me a decent piece of land, and start pissing in the wind.
Get me the hell out of this godforsaken place.
JIM: Ree done that to you?
I'm just asking.
Yeah, they done it.
They took their sweet time with it.
At the start, I didn't feel nothing. I just heard the sound...
...of the knife scraping against my skull...
...and them all laughing and whooping and hollering and whatnot.
Then the blood came.
It was cold. It started streaming down my face, in my eyes...
...and breathing it in. Choking on it.
That's when I felt it.
Yeah, felt all of it.
I got my head turned inside out.
JIM: Jesus.
Them Indians down Texas way...
...they may rob you, but they ain't gonna take your topknot.
JIM: When was it?
Goddamn it, will you quit that noise now, will you?
Quit it.
FITZGERALD: I'm falling further back... ...from Henry and the boys on account of tending to you.
Got to get up the damn mountain, but winter keeps chasing us down.
If you ready to take the sacrament...
...I can do that for you.
What you holding to, Glass?
You know...
...it would be better...
...if you were to take that last breath of yours now...
...for all of us.
Now you hung tough.
And that's something.
I'm begging you.
Them Ree are so close I can smell 'em. You can smell 'em too.
You got to think of your boy. All right? 'Cause you're gonna kill him.
You'll kill us all.
I can muzzle you if you like.
Take away this suffering quick and easy. No one ever has to know that you give up.
All you have to do is blink if you want me to do that.
Save your boy and blink.
You just have to blink.
Yeah. There it is.
You'd best hope the good Lord'll get His ass here quick, huh?
Maybe He'll forgive your sins, maybe not.
Thus I do commend thee to the Lord.
Through Jesus Christ the Lord of all reality and mercy...
Through Jesus Christ the Lord of all reality and mercy... ...and the Father and the Creator, I hold thee--
HAWK [IN ENGLISH] Get away! Get away!
HAWK [IN ENGLISH] Get away! Get away! You okay? Jim! Jim! Help!
You okay? Jim! Jim! Help!
HAWK: Help! -Calm down. Jim! Help!
Don't shout! You're gonna get us all killed!
Don't shout! You're gonna get us all killed! Keep away! I'll tell the captain what you did.
Keep away! I'll tell the captain what you did.
They'll hang you! -They'll hang you! Jim, help! -We have an understanding.
-They'll hang you! Jim, help! -We have an understanding.
What's fucking wrong with you people?
Shit.
JIM: I got one beaver, Hawk.
Breathing changed?
I hadn't noticed.
Damn, he's cold as ice.
Here you go, Mr. Glass. This will help you. Keep you warm.
It's all right.
Where's Hawk?
He ain't with you?
No.
No?
I understand, Mr. Glass.
It's all right. I think I'll get a fire going.
FITZGERALD: Yeah. Sounds like a good idea.
JIM: Hawk!
Hawk!
FITZGERALD [WHISPERING]: Shh. Ree.
There's about 20 of them down by the creek.
They're headed this way. Grab your shit and let's go.
Shit. What do we do?
FITZGERALD: Run, right now.
-What about Hawk? -He ain't our problem no more.
We can't just leave him.
Either he's gutted or scalped. And if he ain't he can find us, can't he?
What about Glass?
He ain't our problem. Like us, he's on his own.
We made a promise to the captain. A proper burial when the time was needed.
He needs that rifle!
He couldn't do nothing with it if you tarred it to his hand.
We can't do this.
We got no fucking choice.
JIM: No, we can't. Look at him.
All right, shit, then, buddy. Get him up. You want to take him?
Come on now!
JIM: Easy. Slowly, Fitz. Easy with him.
FITZGERALD: Just get your shit.
Get your shit!
Shut up.
Shut up!
Fitz. What are you doing?
What does it look like? Proper burial. Like you wanted.
JIM: No, not like this.
FITZGERALD: Why not?
He's alive, Fitz. He's alive.
So shoot him.
I have to go. I have to go.
I'm sorry, Mr. Glass. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
MURPHY: Captain! This way!
There's a path down here!
ANDERSON: There ain't shit down there! We got to climb over!
JONES: Glass said to stay east! ANDERSON: Glass can go to hell!
HENRY: What's the map say?
Keep climbing. We climb, Captain. We keep climbing.
Till we reach Old Gabe.
We climb.
We got to wait for Murph.
ANDERSON: Yeah. You wait for him.
Captain?
Sir... ...Murphy says there's a way down there. Who we following?
...Murphy says there's a way down there. Who we following?
ANDERSON: You follow who you want! I'm going up!
Stubby, keep going up!
JONES: Murph! Come here!
[IN PAWNEE] I'm not leaving you, son.
I'm right here.
FITZGERALD: Fire's done.
I can't even feel my feet.
Didn't we put enough distance between us and them Ree?
A dozen Ree can make twice as good time as we can.
-Twenty. -What?
You said you saw twenty Ree.
Yeah? What you talking about?
-You woke me up. -Mm-hm.
You said you saw twenty Ree by the creek.
Well, yeah, twenty, a dozen...
...it don't matter. I wasn't gonna hang around counting fucking feathers.
As a matter of fact...
...what was you doing down by the creek all by yourself?
I'd already brought up plenty of water.
Answer me, Fitzgerald. I asked you a question.
Don't question me on account of you feel guilty.
Don't question me on account of you feel guilty. Answer me or I'll blow your head off.
You got a short memory, boy.
Your ass would be floating around the Missouri right now... ...if it wasn't for me.
You want to ask questions? What you want to ask? If you want to know, ask it.
What you want to ask? If you want to know, ask it.
You want to know why you left Mr. Glass back there for dead, huh?
Or why you left your little boyfriend running around?
Or why you left your little boyfriend running around? You want to know if he's still alive?
You want to know if he's still alive?
I'll tell you why. It's 'cause you ain't a man yet. It's 'cause you was scared shitless. You're scared now.
It's 'cause you was scared shitless. You're scared now.
The Ree.
What of them?
Tell me, did you see 'em?
-Put your rifle down. -Did you see the Ree?
No.
Not a single one.
You fucking lied to me? You lied to me!
I had to scare some sense into you, boy.
Glass was dead. Hawk we don't know about.
No point in either of us dying either, you understand?
The way I see it, I saved your life twice now. I ought to be God to you.
And God giveth and God taketh away.
Lucky fucker.
Next time you want to shoot somebody...
...you might want to use powder, prime your rifle.
Come on. Let's git. Grab your shit.
Fresh blood. This could be Powaqa.
[IN ARIKARA] A dead boy.
[IN ARIKARA] A Pawnee boy.
Let's go.
Who did this?
FITZGERALD: I don't know.
Could be Captain Leavenworth's boys. Mmm. Yeah.
Put some eyes on the back of your head.
These Injuns ain't never as dead as you think they are.
Look at 'em, huh? They're always stealing our shit.
FITZGERALD: We got horses over here!
Hey, Bridger.
We got horses!
JIM: What you want to do about these pigs?
FITZGERALD: The Lord's on our side, kid.
FITZGERALD: You all right there, kid?
Your head in the right place?
I guess.
I can't help thinking about whether we did the right--
I can't help thinking about whether we did the right-- Ain't our place to wonder. The good Lord...
...got us on a road whether we choose it or not.
My pop, he weren't a religious man, you know?
If you couldn't grow it, kill it, or eat it, he just plain old didn't believe in it.
And this one time he head on up the old Saba hills. San Saba hills?
He joined a couple Texas Ranger buddies of his to hunt.
Pretty routine. He done it like a hundred times before.
Should have been a 3-day kill, but on the second day...
Should have been a 3-day kill, but on the second day... ...it all went fucked.
Somehow that night he lost his buddies.
And to top it off... ...them Comanches went and took the horses.
So he was starving and delirious...
...and he crawls up into this mott...
...this group of trees out in the middle of nowhere... ...just sticking up in this ocean of scrub...
...just sticking up in this ocean of scrub...
...and he found religion.
At that moment, he told me...
...he found God.
And it turns out that God....
He's a squirrel.
Yeah. A big, old meaty one.
"I found God," he used to say.
"And while sitting there and basking in the glory and sublimity of mercy...
...I shot and ate that son of a bitch."
Yeah. You might want to close your eyes, kid.
[IN PAWNEE] I'm injured.
[IN PAWNEE] What happened to you?
A bear.
A bear.
[IN PAWNEE] My men... left me for dead.
Killed my son.
I lost my family too.
Sioux killed my people.
I'm going south to find more Pawnee.
My heart bleeds...
But revenge is in the creator's hands.
You will ride with me...
HIKUC: Your body is rotten.
Need to heal.
You could die.
FITZGERALD: Yeah! There she is.
We did it.
You ought to be proud of yourself, boy.
Yeah.
We followed orders. We just skipped the funeral part.
Don't go down there and start growing no conscience.
Don't go down there and start growing no conscience. 'Cause sure as night'll come they'll have us swinging from a couple ropes.
'Cause sure as night'll come they'll have us swinging from a couple ropes.
We did what we had to do.
FITZGERALD: We had the extra day so we managed to dig...
...a little deeper, lay rocks on top so scavengers couldn't get at him.
It was done right and all. He was buried right.
-Sir, can we-- -The truth is that...
...ahem, when Hawk disappeared, I was worried about savages.
And I was ready to get, to move on out.
Yeah, but Bridger here argued to stay.
He argued to stay... ...so he could at least build a cross or something...
...to put on top of Glass's grave, and that's what he did. That's what we did.
I'm glad you pulled your weight, Mr. Bridger.
I'm glad you pulled your weight, Mr. Bridger. He more than pulled his weight, captain. This man here, he was my partner.
He more than pulled his weight, captain. This man here, he was my partner.
All right.
Am I to assume that the agreed arrangement did not change?
Uh, fortunately for me, it did not.
Thank you...
...for your courage, honor, and service.
Deal or no deal, Mr. Bridger, you deserve something for what you did.
Thank you.
Kid's been beating himself up awful bad the whole trip.
We all saw the shape Glass was in.
There was no more to be done. Right?
FITZGERALD: Yeah.
We all saw him.
WIFE: When there is a storm...
And you stand in front of a tree...
If you look at its branches, you swear it will fall.
But if you watch the trunk, you will see its stability.
SCOUT [IN ARIKARA]: There are traces of a camp...
There are traces of a camp...
Where?
Entering the moon forest.
Maybe from two days ago. They are moving east.
Tell the others.
Let's move quickly. Powaqa could be with them!
TOUSSAINT [IN FRENCH]: Bring me the girl...
Those five horses weren't for free.
Shh.
[IN ENGLISH] Don't make a sound.
GLASS [IN PAWNEE]: I will get a horse.
POWAQA [IN ARIKARA]: I'll cut off your balls.
MAN [IN FRENCH]: Where is Toussaint?
GLASS: Come here...
FITZGERALD: May I join you? HENRY: Yes.
-Yeah? -Yes.
I was wondering when we might be getting paid for that haul.
I was wondering when we might be getting paid for that haul. 'Cause them pelts we collected are still out there, you know...
'Cause them pelts we collected are still out there, you know...
...under a couple foot of dirt and snow. But that ain't my fault.
I'm waiting for Captain Leavenworth to arrive with his army.
Then we'll have enough men...
...to shoot some civilization into those fucking Arikara and get back our pelts.
All right. All right.
When's that supposed to happen?
I don't know.
But until then, nobody gets paid.
Listen here, all right?
Listen here, all right? I was hired to trap 'em. I wasn't hired to guard 'em.
I was hired to trap 'em. I wasn't hired to guard 'em.
The way I see it, now you, you got a safe.
It's probably full of money.
You signed a contract to protect your boss...
You signed a contract to protect your boss... ...and your boss's property.
And that safe isn't full anymore. It's short about $300.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means, according to my records...
...you purchased more goods on the expedition... ...than what you are owed by the company.
Now, Happy New Year, Fitzgerald.
GUARD: Fryman! White man at the gate!
Speak English.
[IN ENGLISH] I have no weapon.
Open her up!
Get the captain!
HENRY: Where are your men?
All dead.
Who was he?
I don't know. Something to eat, please?
Food comes at a price.
-I have no money. -Then you don't eat.
Give back some of them stolen pelts you buy from the Injuns.
-Not now, Jones. -Huh?
Silver. How is this? Silver.
This all you got?
We was nine.
My friend, he die in the snow.
And the other was...
...kill by wolf. I see it.
By wolf, yeah, kill.
Where'd you get this?
Canteen.
He drop it. He kill Toussaint, he drop it--
-Who? Who? -I don't know. I don't see.
It could be Hawk.
Yeah, could be.
JONES: That half-breed runt couldn't steal no horse.
-Maybe it was Weston. STUBBY BILL: Or Beckett.
How far from here?
Thirty mile.
Northwest, near the Yellowstone.
The Yellowstone!
Get the horses saddled. Torches and supplies.
Ten dollars a man.
Anderson, you stay here.
ANDERSON: Yes, sir. Feed him and watch him.
I'll get you a drink.
HENRY: When we get to the Yellowstone, we split into two groups!
HENRY: Hawk!
JIM: Hawk, you out there?
HENRY: Keep your guard up!
Eyes in front!
Who are you?
FRYMAN: Beckett? Is that you?
Glass!
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ, what happened?
[IN ENGLISH] Where is he?
HENRY: Jones, take him. Go.
I'm riding ahead. Bill, take Bridger.
Take Bridger!
-Have you seen Fitzgerald? -No, sir.
Get up. Get up!
-You seen Fitzgerald? -No, sir.
Fitzgerald?
Whoa, easy.
Where did he go?
-Who? -Fitzgerald. Where did he go?
-I have no idea. -Tell me or I'll take your head off.
I swear to God--
Tell me. Tell me!
Texas!
He said he was going to Texas. He said he was gonna reenlist.
He said he was going to Texas. He said he was gonna reenlist. Then he started talking about property. "A decent piece of land."
Then he started talking about property. "A decent piece of land."
He's heading for Texas. That's all I know.
Stay here.
Fitzgerald!
Fitzgerald!
Goddamn it!
Goddamn it!
GUARD: Jones! Get the Captain!
-Fryman! JONES: Open the gate!
GUARD: Open it up!
JONES: Murphy, get the Captain.
HENRY: Get him to the doctor. Now!
You said he was dead! You said he was dead!
I thought he was, I swear!
JIM: He lied to me! HENRY: You're a liar.
You left him out there!
Say the Lord's Prayer.
Say the Lord's Prayer!
Our Father, Who art in heaven. Who art-- I can't!
Shut up! Shut up!
From here out, you're a prisoner charged with treason!
Take him to the cage! Take him to the cage or you'll hang alongside him!
I thought he was gonna die!
Fitz lied to me!
I couldn't help him!
How is he?
DOCTOR: He'll be fine, but there is swelling. He needs to rest. I'll be back to check up on him.
GLASS: He ran off, didn't he?
Bridger's telling the truth.
How's that?
Fitzgerald lied to him. He was just following orders.
He wasn't there when Fitzgerald stabbed my boy to death.
Is that what happened?
He killed Hawk.
I need a horse and gun.
No, you need to rest and eat. I'm going after him.
No.
You'll never find him without me.
If we wait till morning he'll get away.
No, he won't.
He's afraid.
He knows how far I came for him.
Same as that elk.
When they get afraid, they run deep into the woods.
I got him trapped. He just doesn't know it yet.
How can you be so sure?
'Cause he has everything to lose.
All I had was that boy.
And he took him from me.
I can't let you go back out there. Not again.
I ain't afraid to die anymore.
I done it already.
I'm going with you.
GLASS: That's his horse, all right.
No way he could've ridden through the night.
HENRY: How far ahead?
Half a day at the most.
Could be Ree. If they aren't his, we lose him.
Unless he reenlisted so he could justify killing again...
...these tracks right here are his.
Come on.
HENRY: I can't remember my wife's face.
Last week, she was still with me.
Now she's gone.
I worry I won't recognize her when I get back home.
Is it true you killed an officer?
I just killed the man who was trying to kill my son.
Smoke.
How close?
No more than a mile up that way.
I'm gonna head up to the west. You go down to the east.
See if we can find some tracks.
And if it's the Ree?
If it's the Ree, you turn right back around... ...and meet me back here. Tsk.
Now, I wouldn't expect to find a man of your stature...
...so far away from his stove on a morning as cold as this, captain.
You lost?
I'm here to take you back to Fort Kiowa...
...where you will be tried for murder.
Is that so?
I ain't crazy about your plan.
Besides, I got one of my own.
We had a deal, Glass!
I tried to tell your boy, all right?
I tried to tell him, but he wouldn't listen and he kept on screaming.
He was gonna get everybody killed.
But you and me, we had a deal.
You know what happened out there.
And on my soul, the Lord, He knows...
...what happened out there.
There was no deal.
You killed my boy.
Well, maybe you should've raised a man, instead of some girlie little bitch.
Goddamn it.
You came all this way just for your revenge, huh?
Well, you enjoy it, Glass.
'Cause there ain't nothing gonna bring your boy back.
No, it won't.
for the Ancients to bring humanity to the brink of extinction.
Those who survived mobilized their settlements
to begin life anew upon a poisoned Earth.
In the hunt for food and fuel,
the weak perished,
and the strong grew ever more powerful.
Until a new age arose.
The Age of the Great Predator Cities of the West.
Two.
[lookout through speakers] Predator! Predator City! Six miles and closing!
[Bürgermeister] Hurry! Fire up the engines!
Move it, Dietrich! Fire them up!
-[Dietrich] Crank all engines! -Come on! Come on!
[Dietrich] Engine one is down!
Switch to auxiliaries!
Hurry! Hurry!
Start them up!
Full throttle!
-Full power! -[grunts]
[man] Yeah!
[worker] Lord Mayor on deck.
-Lord Mayor. -Mr. Valentine. What have we got?
Small Bavarian mining town, powered by C20 land engines.
Usual store of brick, coal and iron. And 75 tons of salt.
And 75 tons of salt.
Barely enough fuel to last us a week.
We've left the safety of Britain, we've crossed the land bridge, for what?
To feed upon the scraps of Europe.
-Run it down. -[chief navigator] Aye, aye, sir.
They're gaining on us!
Empty the silos. All of them!
Do it!
It's madness out there.
You'd think they'd never seen a chase before.
Well, it has been a while, sir.
-Morning, Clytie. -Morning, Dr. Pomeroy.
The news is not good from The Hall of Ceramics.
I'm afraid we've suffered some casualties.
-Damn these bloody vibrations! -[rumbling]
-Oh! -Steady on, Arkie!
No, no, no. Don't worry about me!
We're about to lose our American deities!
[Katherine] Excuse me, Dr. Pomeroy.
Good morning, Miss Valentine.
I've been waiting outside the Manuscripts Room for quite some time.
Your nine o'clock?
I do apologize.
This is not good enough.
Where the hell is Tom?
[Tom] Coming through!
-Watch it, bud! -Sorry.
Sorry. Sorry.
Give me everything you have!
-They're heading for the foothills. -Stay on course.
-Sir... -Stay on course.
Take the shot.
[man] Incoming!
Well done, everyone!
-Prepare to ingest. -[chief navigator] Aye, aye, sir!
Ah, Mr. Natsworthy! Nice of you to join us.
I'm so sorry I'm late, sir.
You look nice. Have you had a haircut?
-Is that a new cologne? -I don't want to hear it, Tom.
You're already on your third warning. This is your last.
[announcer on PA] Citizens of Salzhaken, welcome to London.
Bring only your personal possessions with you.
Old tech is to be deposited in the bins provided.
Citizens of Salzhaken, welcome to London.
[Tom] So, you're studying the end of the Ancients?
[Katherine] What I really need are firsthand accounts of the Sixty-Minute War.
Journals, books, personal papers.
Very few written records survived during that period.
It may very well be they forgot how to read and write altogether.
But if it's the Sixty-Minute War you're after, follow me.
Just give us a minute.
Strange to think this is what it looked like.
Twenty-first century? Yep.
[Katherine] It's so different.
That's what happens when the Earth's crust gets shattered into 1,000 pieces.
Check this out.
-Did you make this? [chuckles] -Yeah. Bits of old scrap tech I found.
The power system was a little bit tricky,
but luckily, I got my man Matthew there limbered up and ready to go.
This is what I wanted to show you.
[Tom] It's a Quantum Energy weapon.
There were dozens of them, all over the globe.
My God.
They called it Medusa.
How can a society so advanced, so scientific, be so stupid?
Well, no more stupid than people today. They just had far worse weapons.
And far more sophisticated control systems.
What a nightmare.
Well, the Ancients felt the same way. That's why they created this little fella.
A crash drive to shut down the weapon.
-Doesn't this stuff creep you out? -Let me tell you something.
We come across dangerous tech
that's in way better condition than this junk all the time.
Now, I've noticed that pieces have started to go missing.
I notified my boss, who notified his boss, and of course nothing happened,
I notified my boss, who notified his boss, and of course nothing happened, so I decided to take a few precautions of my own.
so I decided to take a few precautions of my own.
[Tom] All of it is viable weapons-grade tech.
-[Katherine] God help us. -The next time we cross the marshlands,
I'm tossing the entire bloody lot over the side.
Just let it sink to the bottom of a swamp where no one will ever find it.
[Herbert] Miss Valentine! You should have told me you were coming.
I would have laid something on for you.
Hello, Herbert.
What are you still doing here, Natsworthy? You're on Gut Duty.
No, I'm assisting Miss Valentine.
-Not anymore. You've been demoted. -What?
-Uh, by who? -By me.
You're just a skivvy from the lower tiers with no family and no prospects.
If those dim-witted Spanner-heads beat you to the bins again,
you'll be back to cleaning the bogs.
Chop-chop.
Well, it’s been lovely chatting. I have to go.
[scoffing] It's rush hour. He'll never make it.
Wait! Tom!
Tom! Wait! I can get you down there.
-You what? -I can get you down there.
[announcer on PA] Citizens of Salzhaken, welcome to London.
Bring only your personal possessions with you.
Old tech is to be deposited in the bins provided.
Okay.
-Excuse me. -Sorry.
-Really? -On you go.
Sorry about that.
-[Tom] And that's it? We're through? -[Katherine] Just like that.
[announcer] Stay in your allocated line.
Possession of any form of weapon is strictly prohibited.
Hold up. Hold up. What's this, then? We'll have that. [announcer] Incomers failing to follow instructions will be detained.
So what's the rush? Well, gotta get down there, and go through all the artifacts
Well, gotta get down there, and go through all the artifacts
taken off the Catch.
And anything of historical importance goes to the Museum.
But if I'm late,
the Gut workers shovel everything into the furnaces.
All they care about is feeding the beast.
[announcer] ...failing to follow instructions will be detained.
-No weapons allowed. -[man] You cannot do this!
Are you stupid? No weapons!
[announcer] Be aware, children may be temporarily separated from parents.
[man on PA] Nether Borough Station.
Disembark here for Digestion Yards, Incomer Processing and Main Engine Rooms.
Mind the drop.
-They still haven't caught her? -Who, Anna Fang?
[Tom] Yeah. Bloody Anti-tractionists.
Should be locked up, in my opinion.
Next one. Move it. What about you, eh? What are you hiding?
Yeah, all right. Go through. Next.
[announcer] Incomers failing to follow instructions will be detained.
All belongings must be presented...
We're the enemy. Anti-tractionists loathe everything we stand for.
Yeah, what, like progress?
It's not progress, not to them. To them, our way of life is unsustainable.
-They see Tractionism as a... -Oh!
Bevis! Mate, your tools are all over the floor! [chuckles]
I'm so sorry.
You all right, Tom? On bins again?
Yeah. What are you doing down here?
Waste chute maintenance. I got it. Just leave it.
I really am sorry. I didn't see you.
Why would you?
Bevis, this is Katherine...
Yeah, I know who she is. I'll catch you later.
[Tom] No, no, no, you don't!
Stop! No! Stop! Stop!
That is a Sunbeam TA200. That's a classic radiant-controlled
double-slice toaster with automatic bread ejection.
We have to...
And you've lost the knob!
Oh, for Quirke's sake.
[Valentine] Someone knows their small appliances.
Here.
Very, very nice.
I've dug up a few of these in my time, but none as good as this.
Couple of small dents, a little bit of tarnishing.
-Springs gone, but they always are. -Yeah, well...
That is far better than anything in the Museum's current collection.
Well done.
That's high praise coming from you, sir.
You know, I just want to say I've read all your books.
Oh, don't encourage him. His head's quite big enough.
Hi, Dad.
Kate, what are you doing here?
I thought you were going to the Museum.
I did. That's where I bumped into Tom.
Tom?
Tom Natsworthy, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
I knew your parents.
They were lovely people. First-class Historians, both.
I thought you had plans to be an Aviator.
Oh, yeah, I was. But then I gave it all up.
I mean, history's more my thing, sir.
[Katherine] I'm surprised they called you down here for such a small Catch.
Don't underestimate what's buried out there in the salt flats.
These mining towns have a way of digging up really interesting...
Old tech.
-No way! -What is that?
That is a fusion inverter cell.
Incredibly rare and really dangerous.
Do you know the Guild of Engineers nicked all the ones we had in store at the Museum
nicked all the ones we had in store at the Museum just a few months ago?
Pomeroy was furious.
Well, they won't get their hands on this one. I'll make sure it's disposed of properly.
Engineers, eh, they think they run the place.
They don't know what they're playing with.
Fire.
Sorry?
They're playing with fire.
I said get your hands off!
What's going on?
Take this gentleman to the medics.
I want that man on a charge.
Move it.
[Valentine] That should never have happened, you all deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.
you all deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.
You will be given food, shelter and employment.
A chance to build a future, make a new life.
Hey! Watch out!
[Hester] Valentine.
This is for my mother. [grunts]
This is for Pandora Shaw.
Dad!
No!
[man 1] They're down here!
[man 2] Hey, you!
No! Stop her!
[man 3] Hey, come back here! Stop!
Get out of the way!
Dad!
Stay here.
No! Wait!
Come on! Come on!
No!
-I've got you. -Let go of me!
[Valentine] Tom!
Tom!
Look at me! Look at me.
This is what he does when you get in his way.
Ask him why he murdered my mother.
Ask him about Hester Shaw.
No! No!
I tried. I tried to stop her.
It's not your fault.
She was saying the craziest things, and then she just...
What did she say?
-You need a doctor. -No, no. What did she say, Tom?
She said you murdered her mother.
Murder?
That's an ugly word.
I'm sorry you had to hear that.
Yeah.
I should go.
Yeah. You should.
[Katherine] Dad!
Dad!
It's all right. It's all right. I'm okay. I'll be okay. I'm okay.
Kate, I'm sorry. There was nothing I could do.
What do you mean?
They were fighting. Tom and the girl.
-[gasps] -The railing broke.
I'm sorry about Tom.
I really am.
We have airships out there looking.
If he's alive, we'll find him.
-What is it? -The girl, who was she?
Honestly, I don't know.
Been wondering about that myself.
But she knew you.
I have never seen her in my life before.
I thought maybe she was an Anti-tractionist.
God knows they hate us enough.
I know you want to believe that Traction Cities and Static Settlements
can live together in peace, but it'll never happen.
You don't know that.
Then why do they hide behind the Shield Wall hoarding their resources?
They mean to see us starve out here, Kate.
Never underestimate their will to destroy us.
There'll never be peace with Shan Guo.
This is ruined. I'll get rid of it.
Oh, my head!
What?
Wait!
What's going on?
Hang on! Hang on! You can't just leave me here!
[Hester] You shouldn't have followed me.
I didn't follow you. I fell.
He pushed me.
Wait!
Oh, for Quirke's sake.
I'm talking to you. Hello?
What am I supposed to do, eh?
Where am I supposed to go? I need to get back on London. Six months. Six months it took me to get on that city.
Six months. Six months it took me to get on that city.
I had one shot at Valentine!
And you ruined it.
Okay, all right. All right.
-I have money. -No, you don't.
Please, please, help me get back on London.
Help me find a trading town, you'll never see me again.
[Crome] We're running low on food, fuel, basic resources.
We can't survive out here much longer.
We should never have gone into Europe. Biggest mistake we ever made.
We have other options.
Ah, yes. Your long-awaited energy project.
-It'll work. -I've heard that before.
-I just need a little more time. -Always so sure of yourself.
Thaddeus Valentine, the great Archeologist.
Man of the people. One of the reasons I took you in,
why I allowed an Outsider from nowhere to have power above his station.
But my patience is wearing thin.
I raised you up...
I can tear you down.
How can you stand him?
He's afraid.
He's trying to hang on to a way of life that doesn't exist anymore.
Municipal Darwinism.
It's a dying system. Prey has all but gone.
Soon there'll be nothing left.
I'm trying to build this city a future, but Crome's stuck in the past.
Where are you going? Dad, you can't go to work!
[Valentine] I'm fine, Kate.
[Katherine] You're not fine. You're injured. You need to rest.
I've spent 15 years developing this power system.
I'm not having Magnus Crome or Hester Shaw stop me now.
Who's Hester Shaw?
No one.
No one you know.
[Tom] Could you slow down, please?
[Hester] You wanna find a trading town? Keep moving.
-[Tom] My feet hurt. -Get used to it.
That's what I like about you. Your boundless sense of empathy.
-What did you say? -Nothing.
You're right. Look, I talk too much.
Especially when I'm nervous. I'm not gonna talk anymore.
Zipped.
No more talking.
Don't worry about me.
I'm more than capable of looking after myself.
Might surprise you to learn that I was gonna be an Aviator.
I have a faultless sense of direction.
[Hester] All right.
Which way?
Oh. My navigational instincts tell me...
We should go...
That way.
That way. Definitely.
Those tracks head south.
Yeah.
You never head south in the Outlands.
Not ever.
[Valentine] I reconfigured the metrics.
You can amplify the magnetic resonance using materials on hand.
-What else do you need? -Several more weeks.
Unless you can find me more old tech.
All the old tech comes to you.
I'll need more than one to stabilize the isotopes.
Make it work.
I hear you suffered an injury this morning.
You never told me Pandora Shaw had a daughter.
She could be a problem.
She won't stop until I'm dead.
Unless you kill her first.
I received a message from Sharkmoor Prison this morning.
They claim to have captured a Stalker.
One of the Resurrected. A bounty-killer gone rogue.
Well, it's no use to us. Too hard to control.
They say it was hunting something.
Or someone.
It appears the two of you share a common interest.
This thing is so fixated on its prey,
all it does is pound the walls of its cell, shrieking her name.
Hester Shaw.
-Where to, boss? -Sharkmoor Prison.
No fires.
Unless you want every Scav Town from here to Rustwater to find us.
That doesn't look clean enough to wash in. I wouldn't...
Oh, my God! That's disgusting!
Thirst will kill you before hunger.
It's either this or you can drink your own urine.
I'll take my chances.
"Best before 2118"?
It's an Inkie.
It's over 1,000 years old.
Doesn't matter. The food of the Ancients never goes off. It's indestructible.
It's so quiet out here. Doesn't that bother you?
I like the quiet.
I grew up with the sound of engines.
I've never known anything else.
It's funny, you know. I've spent my whole life dreaming of getting off London,
seeing the world.
And now I'm out here talking about drinking my own urine.
-Careful what you wish for, eh? -I thought you wanted to be an Aviator.
Oh, I did. But then my parents died.
Eight years ago now.
When Tier Four collapsed in the Big Tilt.
Yeah.
What about you? How old were you when your mother died?
-We're not gonna do this. -Do what?
We're not gonna tell each other our sad stories.
I can't help you.
And you can't help me.
[Tom] Hello!
Hello! Over here!
-Tom! -Hey!
Get down!
It's a trading town. Look! Look! Look! Look!
Look!
[Hester] Oh, God.
They're Southies!
-That was close. -Too close. Get off me!
[Hester] Run!
What the hell are Southies?
Scavs on a night hunt.
What are they hunting?
Us.
I've got you.
Come on!
Hester?
Hester!
-Are you in one piece? -Yes.
-Are you in one piece? -Yes. -[shushing] -[rumbling]
Couple more seconds and you'd have been fender meat!
Lucky for you we was here.
How bad is it?
She needs a doctor!
No quacks here! Not on Scuttlebutt.
Could you take us to the nearest town?
Chipping Sodbury! That'd be the nearest, wouldn't you say, Mr. Wreyland?
I would, my love.
Well, go on then, set a heading north. We must look after our guests.
Tea?
Don't mind if I do.
I make it myself. The algae's fresh.
[sighs] It's actually not bad. It's not bad! Bottoms up!
Funny you should say that.
We grow it in the run-off under the sewage room.
Nasty. That's gonna leave a scar.
You don't need any more of those, do you, Petal?
Bevis! Bevis Pod! I need to speak to you.
I can't help you.
The girl that attacked my father... I don't know what you're talking about.
What do you mean? You were there. You saw what happened.
Are you trying to get me arrested?
The first rule down here is "keep your mouth shut."
My father's in some kind of trouble. He's lying to me. I need to know why.
Your father lies to a lot of people.
What's that supposed to mean?
Please. I just wanna know the truth.
No, you don't.
-I promise you, my father's a good man. -No, just stop. Stop.
He pushed him. Your father pushed Tom off the city.
Why? Why would he do that to Tom?
Because he got in the way.
[Bevis] It's a lie. A cover-up.
They're building something in there.
Something they don't want anyone to see.
I tried to get inside, but there are guards at every entrance.
There's no way in.
What if there was?
[Mrs. Wreyland] Here we are then.
It's not the Lord Mayor's suite at the Boggy Regis,
but it's better than a poke in the eye with a burnt stick.
Make yourselves at home.
I'll be back bright and early to empty your slops.
Thank you.
Not much of a talker, is she? Your girlfriend.
Oh, no, no, no, no. She's not my girlfriend.
Of course not! Handsome boy like you, you can do much better.
All right. Well, good night, Mrs. Wreyland.
Oh, dear! There I go putting my foot in it! -I didn't mean... -No, I know what you meant.
-I didn't mean... -No, I know what you meant.
You take the bed. I'll take the...
Floor.
This is all my fault.
I'm sorry.
I was eight.
I was eight years old when my mother died.
She was an Archeologist.
She loved traveling the world
and digging up the past.
They're beautiful.
[Hester] He used to visit all the time.
[Hester] He'd spend hours poring over the things that she had found.
Then one day,
everything changed.
She'd found something, on one of her digs in Lost America.
Something he wanted.
-[gasps] -Pandora, what are you doing?
No. No.
What was it?
I don't know.
-[Valentine] Stop this! Don't do this! -[Pandora] Let go of me!
-[Valentine] I'm taking it! -[Pandora] No!
-Mama! -Hester, take this.
Keep it safe.
[young Hester] Mama!
But he killed her for it.
Run, Hester!
Hester!
[Hester] He would have killed me, too.
But I got away.
[Pierrepoint] We caught it on the edge of the Marshlands.
It had torn apart a whole town, murdered them all.
I lost a dozen good men bringing it in.
There've always been rumors that a few had survived,
the ones that turned rogue after the Nomad Wars.
But I never thought I'd live to see one in the flesh.
Not that there's much of that left.
[Shrike] Hester!
The last of the Lazarus Brigade.
Resurrected from the sleep of death.
-[gasps] -[Shrike] I do not sleep!
No, you've been hunting her, haven't you?
Hunting Hester Shaw.
Why?
Answer me.
She broke her promise.
What happens when you find her?
What happens when you find Hester Shaw?
I will kill her.
[Vambrace] Are you sure about this?
There's no telling what that thing might do.
I know exactly what it will do.
Hold it steady.
Oh. What's wrong?
We've changed direction. We're heading south.
Get the door.
It's locked!
[grunts] We're locked in.
Must be something around here.
All right. Maybe.
You have my knife?
If we climb along that ducting, we can jump from the back.
It's not more than, like, 20 feet.
-[sighs] I can't. -Yes, you can.
No, I can't. I'll never make the jump.
You will. I'll help you.
Head due north.
There's a Way Station called Ramskate. You can catch an Air-freighter from there. -[woman screaming] -[whip cracks]
-[Mr. Wreyland] Move it! -Go!
Fine!
[Mr. Wreyland] Ah! Stop your sniveling.
[man] Help!
What are you waiting for? Go!
[Mr. Wreyland] Come here. Come here.
Time to check out, folks.
Out you come.
Move it!
That was your chance!
I couldn't do it. I couldn't leave you.
Well, then you're a fool. I would have left you.
[Stigwood] Ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to Rustwater Market. [cackling]
[Stigwood] This next item is a vintage piece!
Now, she may look a little tatty around the edges,
but she's a little ripper!
So, who'll give me 12 quirkes?
-[all laughing, disagreeing] -Aye? Oh, come on!
Last chance to secure this genuine antique!
10 quirkes, or I'm chucking her in.
-Two! -Sold!
Next!
[Stigwood] Stone the crows!
Full disclosure to my valued clients at the back.
This one is a real swamp donkey and priced accordingly.
-Do I have 10 quirkes? -Three!
[Stigwood] Oh, you stingy bastard, De Groot. You can do better than that.
I'm fully aware of the exorbitant margins currently enjoyed
by the sausage-making sector.
-Hester! -Stay still!
Five quirkes and she's yours!
-Four. -Four quirkes to my left. Do I hear five?
-Hester! -Shut up!
Cheer up, love.
You'll look considerably better as a roll of salami.
Going once, going twice...
[woman] Fifty!
[Stigwood] An unregistered bidder.
Please, approach the stage.
Fifty quirkes for this soggy dollop is an extraordinarily generous offer, madam.
Normally, that would be enough to make me self-pollinate.
But my problem is this.
50 quirkes is not 50,000 quirkes.
-Get to the point. -Well, it's quite simple really.
There is a bounty on your head, Miss Fang.
So, either you pay me 50,000 quirkes for the girlie,
or I claim it from the authorities when I hand you in.
Why don't we settle this with "buy it now"?
-[woman laughs] -[crowd exclaims]
Hester! Come!
-Wait! -Hester!
Hurry!
-See, I knew you wouldn't leave me. -Shut up and run.
This way!
That's a Resurrected Man.
Shrike.
His name is Shrike.
You made me a promise, Hester Shaw.
Now you must keep it.
Go, now! Run! This way!
[Hester] Come on!
Hester! Come on!
Come on!
Hester!
Get on!
I've got you!
-Wait! -Leave him!
Tom!
Cut the rope! Do it!
Catch!
-Where are you taking us? -Just stay behind me. I'll handle this.
How? How exactly will you handle it?
Easy, all right? Just...
I'm just messing with you.
Sit down. Both of you.
That means you, too, City Boy. Sit.
You're injured.
[Hester] You saved our lives.
Why?
You don't trust anybody, do you?
Just like your mother.
You look like her, too.
You knew her?
Pandora Shaw was the bravest woman I ever met.
After she died, I looked for you.
I looked for a long time.
Like everybody else, I thought you were dead.
When I heard you were alive, made me wonder...
How did an 8-year-old girl survive all alone in the Outlands?
Now I know.
You were raised by that corpse.
You don't know what you're talking about.
-Actually, I do. I've studied them. -No, you don't.
-You've studied them? -I know a lot about the Resurrected.
You don't know anything about him.
The people who created them were insane.
Off the charts crazy!
They took all the worst parts of themselves-- Shut up.
...all the savagery, cruelty and hatred
and poured it into these machines! These monsters!
Shut up! He saved my life.
You're an idiot.
-Mr. Valentine! -Not now.
-I'm sure you know who I am. -No, I don't.
Herbert Melliphant.
Your daughter's a very good friend of mine.
No, she's not.
Sir, I have something that may be of interest to you.
A cache of old tech. High quality. Military grade.
I'm overdue a promotion myself.
I'm thinking a university post, or an honorary degree.
A position with a title.
You have a supply of old tech?
Where is it?
Shrike saved my life.
[Hester] He took me in.
He looked after me...
-[whimpers] -...in his own way.
[Shrike] Eat.
The living must eat.
[Hester] He liked to collect things.
Broken things.
Things that others had thrown away.
I think he saw in those strange machines
a reflection of himself.
Where is his heart?
It has no heart.
Like me.
[Hester] I think somewhere deep inside a memory remained.
A memory from another life.
I think he had a family once.
[Shrike] You are sad.
Always sad, Hester Shaw.
Your heart is broken.
I will take away the pain.
I will remake you,
as I was remade.
You're gonna kill me.
For a little while.
I made him a promise.
I would become like him.
My flesh, steel.
My nerves, wire.
My mind wiped clean.
-No thoughts. -No!
-[Hester] No feelings. -No!
Nothing.
I would be free.
If that's what you wanted, why did you leave?
Because six months ago, London crossed the land bridge
and Thaddeus Valentine came within my reach.
[Shrike] Hester!
That's it.
That's my sad story.
Where are we going?
Have you heard of The Cat's Cradle?
[Bevis] The Cat's Cradle? I thought it was a myth.
[Katherine] It's not a myth.
It was built by the Scriven in the first days of London.
It's the sort of thing Historians know about and everyone else has forgotten.
[Dr. Pomeroy] You're too late.
Dr. Pomeroy?
[Dr. Pomeroy] They came in this morning.
A couple of thugs from the Guild of Engineers.
I tried to stop them. They knocked me to the ground.
They knew what they were looking for.
They cleaned the place out. Took it all to St. Paul's.
[Dr. Pomeroy] There are over 1,000 stairs in the Cradle.
Turn upon turn.
But eventually they lead to the crypt beneath St. Paul's.
Be careful, child.
Whatever it is they are doing in that church
has nothing to do with God.
Hold her steady for a second.
Not bad.
-You've done this before? -Yeah. A bit.
[Anna] Good. You can take her in.
[Tom] Take her in where?
[man on radio] You are cleared for landing, Jenny Haniver.
Dock seven. Welcome to Airhaven.
[speaking other language] This is the girl?
You think she can help us?
That's what we're going to find out.
What about the Londoner? You trust him?
He's alive, isn't he?
[in English] What are they saying?
Captain Khora was just offering to buy you dinner.
Weren't you, Captain?
Sure. Why not?
[Dr. Twix] Magnetic resonance is climbing. Holding at full capacity.
All systems are active. She's ready.
It will all be for nothing unless we act now.
London must turn east.
[chief navigator] New bearing confirmed, 90 degrees.
Coordinates set. 51 degrees north by 71 degrees east.
Why are we altering course?
We're executing the new order, sir.
Whose order?
Windflower.
Whoa. What's going on?
They're the Ruh-shan. The Anti-Traction League of Shan Guo.
This is about my mother, isn't it?
Before she died, Pandora found something.
Something dangerous.
She was afraid of Valentine, of what he might do.
She said if anything should happen to her, I was to find you.
That you could stop him.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Think. Think hard. You must remember.
He took something from her.
What? What did he take?
A piece of old tech.
-What kind of old tech? -I don't know.
She was eight years old. She doesn't remember.
Then perhaps you can help us, Londoner.
Get off me! Get off!
What are they building in that cathedral?
Six months ago, Valentine started buying up
Six months ago, Valentine started buying up fusion inverter cells from Scav traders.
-Wait! Fusion inverters? -You know something?
No, that's impossible. He'd have had to have found...
That piece of old tech that Valentine took from your mother,
did it have a symbol on it? Like...
Like this.
Yes.
[Tom] Your mother found a computer core.
The control system of a Quantum Energy weapon.
[Medusa] Medusa is live.
Go! Go! Go! Go!
-How do we shut it down? -[Tom] You don't.
Well, not without the crash drive.
It's a type of key.
A kill switch that overrides the firing sequence.
Once it's initiated, the weapon would self-destruct.
This key, does London have it?
No, it will be long gone. Lost.
Why should we care about those barbarians?
Let Valentine burn every Traction City from here to the Ice Wastes.
He didn't come here looking for prey. Valentine has another target in mind.
You dare countermand an order of the Lord Mayor?
My God.
[Valentine] Nothing can stand in the face of this.
Not the battle-hammers of Arkangel, not the howitzers of Panzerstadt.
Not even the guns of the Anti-tractionists.
In the great game of survival, this is checkmate.
London's heading east. They're moving at speed towards Shan Guo!
I last saw them near the Tannhauser Mountains.
They will have reached the Eastern Plateau by now.
-How much time do we have? -A few hours at most.
[Crome] You mean to go to war?
You cannot ignore the lessons of the past as if they count for nothing.
There are no lessons to be learned from the past.
History doesn't care. It is dead.
This is the future.
The man who controls this controls the world.
Is there no end to your ambition?
You control nothing.
Shut this down!
I want all codes and operational controls
handed in to my office immediately.
Didn't you hear me?
I said...
You cling to the past as if it can save you.
You're a relic of a dying age. A dinosaur.
What does that make you?
Me?
I'm the meteor.
Katherine, come on. Come on!
No! No! Katherine!
You can't go back.
I know he's your father.
You have to let him go.
He's not my father.
Not anymore.
They're gonna attack the Shield Wall. Get word to Governor Kwan.
-[woman 1] Hey! -[man 2] Check the fuel line!
Power's out everywhere.
What is it? What's going on?
-It's a diversion. -[woman 2] Fire!
-[Hester] To create chaos. -[man 3] Fire!
Shrike is here.
Hester Shaw.
Shrike, get out! No! No! Stop shooting!
Anna! Get off of me!
[Hester] Stop! Stop!
Shrike, no! Anna, no!
Get to the Jenny! Now!
Go! Go!
Hester!
[Tom] Watch out!
Nils!
Get down!
Everybody, move!
[man on PA] All Aviators, evacuate now. I repeat, evacuate now!
Come on!
This way!
Hester.
Tom! No! No! Stop! Stop, Shrike!
Stop! You're gonna kill him!
You will not remember him.
No. I'm the one.
I'm the one you came for.
Let him go. [sobs] Let him live.
You are crying.
-He hurt you! -No!
He can't die! He can't!
He can't!
He can't.
You...
You...
You love him.
Shrike?
No! No, Shrike!
This belongs to you.
I release you
from your promise,
Hester
Shaw.
Shrike.
Shrike!
[Valentine] The world is changing.
London must now look beyond Municipal Darwinism
and move into a new age.
Tonight, we set a course for the savage heartland
of the Anti-Traction League.
The Shield Wall of Shan Guo
and the lands beyond will become our new hunting ground.
[Valentine] For centuries, Traction Cities have attempted to breach the Wall.
Their rotting carcasses lie at its base.
But that will not be our fate.
Tonight, London is going to demonstrate its new power.
A power that will sweep all before it.
Tonight, we take the fight to Shan Guo.
[man through speakers] Hold your formation on approach, Jenny Haniver.
Welcome home, Windflower.
Windflower?
I was once kept as a slave on the Ice City of Arkangel.
I vowed never to be owned by another again.
I made my friends swear an oath.
When this body is done,
throw my ashes to the wind.
And I can face anything, even death, as long as my spirit is free.
The Allied Fleet.
The great Defenders of the East.
[Khora] Governor Kwan is waiting.
London is fast approaching.
Governor...
Launch the fleet. We cannot wait.
What are you suggesting? A preemptive strike?
Destroy Medusa before it destroys us.
-No, no, no. You can't do that. -What choice do we have?
We didn't start this, but we will finish it.
Hang on a minute. All right? Listen to me. There has to be another way!
There are thousands of innocent people on that city. They don't deserve to die!
No. They do not. Nor do we seek to harm the innocent.
Understand, life is precious to the Shan Guonese.
So believe me when I say this...
If there was another way,
I would take it.
No. It's my home.
Summon Fleet Command.
We strike first.
Tom.
[Medusa] Entering enemy kill zone in six minutes and 39 seconds.
Raise it up!
We target the searchlights.
Take out their forward defenses.
London's gun turrets are deadly. Don't underestimate them.
We'll have to destroy all fixed artillery to access the cathedral.
Get them into the air. Now!
[Hester] Tom!
Tom! Wait!
What have they done?
Confirm target coordinates.
[Medusa] Coordinates confirmed. Target is locked.
Tom!
[Medusa] Initiate firing sequence.
Tom!
I have it.
Where did you get this?
Go dark.
They're preparing to fire.
Sound the alarm! Everybody off the Wall!
Run!
We need to find Anna.
Now, Twix.
Hell has been unleashed on Earth!
-Hit them again. -Recharging accumulators.
Anna!
-We have to get to London! -[Khora] Are you crazy?
-They're gonna fire that weapon again. -Not if we shut it down.
The crash drive. My mother gave it to me.
The crash drive. My mother gave it to me. Come on, we have to go! They destroyed the Allied Fleet!
Come on, we have to go! They destroyed the Allied Fleet!
They didn't destroy us.
Nils, you lead!
Yasmina, stay on his wing.
Khora!
We're gonna be under heavy fire.
I'll need you to clear a path for me.
-Anna. -Go.
Where's Tom? Tom?
Tom?
You sure you wanna do this? Once we go in, there's no going back.
I have to...
For my mom.
For Pandora.
Let's go!
They're gonna fire again!
[Hester] Pull up! Pull up!
Recharge!
Khora!
Khora!
Stay low, Windflower!
We'll draw their fire!
Let's do this!
Anna, leave it to me.
Nils! Watch out!
Nils! No!
Toa! Cover Yasmina!
I got this one.
We're hit, Anna! We're hit!
[Khora] Yasmina, take out the last one!
-We're going down. Hang on! -[grunting]
Toa! Toa! Come on! Come on, get up!
Okay, okay.
Hester! Take this.
And stay out of sight until I give you the signal.
What signal? How will I know?
Trust me, you'll know. I'm not that subtle.
[Medusa] Warning. Core temperature rising.
Increase the coolant! Recharge!
Over there!
Okay, City Boy. Take her from here.
-What? -I gotta go. I'm late for church.
Hey. Look after her.
Lock target coordinates.
[Medusa] Target is locked.
[Dr. Twix] Wait! Temperatures have to stabilize!
-Prepare to fire! -[Medusa] Firing sequence initiated.
[Valentine] Do it, Twix!
Watch out!
[Medusa] Warning. Core temperature critical.
Deploy system override. Fire again. One more strike, that wall comes down.
Take cover!
[Medusa] System override initiated. Firing will commence in 59 seconds.
[Medusa] Firing will commence in 45 seconds.
[Medusa] Firing will commence in 30 seconds.
Come on!
[Medusa] Firing will commence in 15 seconds.
[Medusa] Ten, nine...
-[Hester] Come on. -...eight...
-Come on. Come on. Come on. -...seven...
-...six, five... -Just let go.
-...four... -It's over.
-...three, two... -Not yet.
-Come on. -...one.
[Medusa] Firing sequence terminated.
Go.
[Medusa] System overload.
Unstable. Unstable.
Now it's over.
Kate. Thank God you're safe.
-We need to go. -How could you?
How many lives have you taken?
-And for what? -I did what I had to.
This city was dying. I tried to save it.
Stop lying to me.
You didn't do this for any noble cause. You did it for yourself.
You did it for yourself. For the power that it gave you!
That's not true.
Kate, we have to go. We have to go now.
Trust me as you once did.
I can save us both.
Save us from what?
The weapon's destroyed. The Wall is still standing.
You've failed.
Failed?
You really don't know me, do you?
That wall is coming down.
-What have you done? -Don't go up there.
Katherine!
-Let's go, Gench. -Roger that.
[Gench] We must be tethered, boss!
[Tom on radio] Come in, London Wheelhouse.
London Wheelhouse, do you read me?
Come in, London Wheelhouse.
-Tom? Tom, is that you? -[Tom] Katherine?
What the hell's going on down there?
We’re on a collision course. He's driving the city into the Wall!
The brakes are gone. They're dead.
You’re gonna have to cut London’s engines!
I can't. The controls are shot to hell.
Katherine, I need you to do something. Are you listening?
You're not going anywhere.
You're not gonna hurt anyone else ever again.
Tom, are you sure about this?
Do it!
I will kill you.
I know you will.
Whatever the world throws at you, you fight it, claw your way back.
You don't give up.
You are so like me.
Your mother never told you, did she?
But then, I guess she didn't need to, because...
you already knew.
Hester.
You let your guard down.
Is this what you want? You wanna die?
Come on, let's finish it.
No.
I'm gonna live.
Hold on!
Come on!
You're history.
Gench!
So what happens now?
We go where the wind takes us.
See the world.
Show me.
[site foreman] Corporate was adamant. We keep running.
No stopping operations.
No, no, no. You got to go through. No cameras.
He's got orders to kill.
I don't even think international laws apply up here.
We are geologists first.
If this thing has any historical significance at all,
we are shutting down. I'm shutting us down.
Oh, he's going to shoot me? Shoot me.
[site foreman] Hey, don't kill her.
This is crazy stuff.
Crazy shit.
Well, what do you think?
I think history is about to change.
♪ I get torn in the wind ♪
[Lucas] ♪ I'm a nasty woman ♪
Oh, look who decided to show up for work.
[Lucas] ♪ I'm a heartbreaker ♪
♪ Gonna make you cry ♪
What, surf report no good at South Padre?
The waves are flat and I got no gas.
You know that, Cade.
Dude. Rude.
Look at these two junebugs. Whoo! My, my!
Hey, you're paying me on this one, right, Cade?
Please tell me I'm getting paid.
You know, Lucas, a lot of guys are just happy to have a job at all.
Yeah, I suppose.
-You got any cash on you? -Yeah.
All right, good.
Hey, Lucas Flannery.
[grandson] Place has been in the family since '28.
Granddaddy ran it all his life.
Ain't that right, Granddaddy?
Real soon he's going to sign it over to me.
[grandfather] The movies nowadays, that's the trouble.
Sequels and remakes, bunch of crap.
I love that one. Oh.
He's deaf and senile.
Heard that.
Now these just need some spit and polish.
I believe they're digital, possibly IMAX.
Yeah, they're not. Mister, we'll have a look around if you want to leave us to it, okay?
You know, folks used to come from miles around
to see the dancing girls with the big cha-chas. [laughs]
I swear to God I am one diaper change away from poisoning his oatmeal.
Hey, you hang in there, buddy.
If coming here makes you feel young,
then you tell this kid to bring you here every day.
Seven bucks, I keep talking.
Sold.
[Lucas] Remember this place when we were kids?
How many girls you think you brought here in high school?
I only remember one.
Hey, heads!
That's why you didn't make the varsity team.
All right. Go long.
Leave it.
Mortar shells?
What the hell happened to you?
Hey, snakeballs. How much for the truck?
Truck?
Two more weeks, girls, till no more classes, ever.
Almost time to get a tan and get wasted!
Please, please.
No financial aid. Great.
Yes, I know I'm home, thank you.
Intruder alert! Back away from the premises!
-Voice recognition. It's me! -I am dialing 911.
Go right ahead. I don't care.
I'm still calling 911.
[male reporter on TV] The Battle of Chicago was an event
[male reporter on TV] The Battle of Chicago was an event that permanently changed our world.
[female reporter] Over 1,300 dead.
[male reporter] Much of the city has been destroyed.
[female reporter 2] Homeland Security is urging everyone to report suspicious alien activity.
[female reporter 3] A swift act of Congress put an end to all joint operations
[female reporter 3] A swift act of Congress put an end to all joint operations between the military and the Autobots, ending the alliance.
between the military and the Autobots, ending the alliance.
[Attinger] As this committee knows,
the Invasion of Chicago was a defining day
the Invasion of Chicago was a defining day for our nation five years ago.
The day millions of people realized that
never again can we allow aliens to fight our battles for us.
A handful of Autobots were given sanctuary
after joint-combat operations were abolished.
Fewer than a dozen Decepticons are still on the run
thanks to our CIA unit,
"Cemetery Wind." [Timothy] Hurry, let's get it to my house, guys.
As for the alien technology,
our objective remains to keep it in American control.
Hi. My name is Timothy. This is my crew.
We found this alien ball turret in Chicago.
We just found it in the rubble and it's all working...
[Attinger] Word has it Japan, India,
the Israelis may have gotten their hands on a couple of ships.
Apparently the Russians are starting a bidding war.
We're taking $5,000 for it. It's got 36 guns, alien shit.
A new era has begun.
And the age of the Transformers is over.
Hey, I've been waiting for you.
You're looking hot today!
Oh, yeah? How about -you take your shirt off? -[truck approaching]
You want me to take my shirt off right now?
What would your dad think of that, huh?
-What the hell? -Hey, where you going?
I cannot believe him. I cannot believe this.
What the hell?
All the way!
A truck?
Dad, please tell me you didn't spend our money on this.
Oh, no, don't worry, he didn't. He spent my money.
A hundred and fifty bucks of it.
As an advance on your regular paycheck.
-What regular paycheck? -Which you will get back.
-When? -Never. We're broke. I knew it.
Sweetheart, could you please not drive a wedge between employer and employee.
Hold on. I thought we were partners. Look, I came up short, okay? I had to buy her a prom dress.
Look, I came up short, okay? I had to buy her a prom dress. You want me to deny her a prom dress?
You might as well. You denied her a prom date.
No, I offered to take her and chaperone.
Nobody wants to go to the dance with their dad. It's weird.
It's not the issue.
Well, maybe it should be.
Hey, could you guys just get off my case? You know what the engine on this runs for?
I can break it down and strip it for parts.
And sweetheart, your shorts are shrinking by the second, okay?
Cold water, air dry, please.
I think she looks hot.
What did you say? Like a hot teenager.
Oh, it's the "teenager" thing that makes it better. Thank you.
It didn't sound like what it meant.
-[Cade] That goes by the circuit boards. -[Lucas sighs]
Put the Zeiss lenses over there.
Dad, please. You can't keep spending money on junk
just so you can turn it into different junk.
We do not use the "J" word in here.
That is a Super Simplex theater projector. It's very rare.
What about the SmilePilot?
Or the Exer-Mower that I invented? Simply ahead of their time.
Yeah, like the alleged Guard-Dawg.
You're gonna get him upset.
Hey, Cade! Cade!
This thing still work?
-No! -Yes. Yes, and still groundbreaking.
Go back there and lay on the recliner and just wait for a cold one.
[Cade] Dude, stop breaking stuff.
Final notice, late notice, past due.
[Lucas] Come on, come on.
Bring Daddy the alcohol. Come on.
I mean, what is all this crap people send you?
That's a Discman and that's an 8-track tape.
-Music. -Never heard of it.
Look, I fix that, it's 100 bucks. I fix that, it's $250.
If I would have been able to fix that before you broke it even more, it would have been 20 bucks.
This stuff is what's gonna put you through college, as long as you land one of those scholarships.
What's the estimated time of arrival, usually? Average?
Wait. So it just brings the beer near you?
That's the trick?
-It's got a couple kinks, man. -[Lucas] Yeah.
Dad, you think maybe some things should never be invented?
No, I don't. That's backwards thinking.
This is a temple of technology. You guys are standing in a holy place.
[laughing] What do you think? Why don't you look at all of this?
This could be yours. What about this land?
Purple People Eater's back and she looks hungry.
Isn't this incredible?
-I knew you would like it. -[Cade] Hey, you! Hey.
I own this house! It's not for sale!
Six months late on payments, Mr. Yeager.
And I see you stealing power at the pole.
[Cade] Hey, that's not your concern.
Sir, do you wanna see the property? Sure.
I'd be more than happy to give you a tour. I'll show you three other buyers I got buried out back,
then I'll crack your head open like an egg! -Whoa! Whoa! -Stay back! He's crazy.
I told you don't come back here anymore.
I will have my brother come back and beat your ass! -Don't you start with me. -Why don't you do it yourself?
And I'll bring the police when I come, too!
-My brother ain't no joke! -Who, Jerry?
You bring his big ass up here, he's gonna be huffing and puffing before he can squeeze out of that car!
You back out on my grass, you're gonna be in big trouble!
You tell Jerry to come see me.
I'll give him some pecan pie.
[groans] She smashed through the fence?
Cade, relax. You're going to have an aortic infarction.
What is that? -I think it's a brain heart attack. -Yeah, I've had one already.
-I think it's a brain heart attack. -Yeah, I've had one already.
So we're stealing power now? No, we're borrowing it from the neighbors.
Great. That's awesome.
Once I graduate and I'm gone, who's gonna take care of you?
Oh, you take care of me?
Who taught you how to solder a circuit?
Or write a program? Or French braid your hair? Or throw a spiral? Me. That's what I do.
Who taught you how to cook without ketchup, or balance your checkbook?
Who always has to be the grownup around here?
All right, you got a point, okay? But that means we're a great team.
And I know it's been sucky around here lately.
But we're gonna be fine, sweetie. You just gotta keep believing, okay?
I mean, that's what great inventors do.
I promise you, one day, I'm gonna build something that matters.
I believe you, Dad.
You know, your mom would be very proud of you.
It's going to be okay.
[soldier 1] Spread out! Push right!
[soldier 2] Roll, roll, roll, roll.
Give me two. Give me two.
Take the beach, nice and easy.
[soldier 3 on radio] All right, hold where you are.
Release the mini-drones.
[pilot on radio] Vipers. Eagle in sight. Cleared hot.
Got a heat sig. Second stack. Closest to the bow.
[gunner on radio] Predator 0-1. Captured target area.
[Savoy on radio] Set charges.
Leader, leader, this is Gunfighter 0-1.
Eagles moving internal. Second deck.
[gunfighter 2] Frogman 83, Frogman 83.
[gunfighter 2] Breached site on rooftop. -Breached site on rooftop. -Have Echo Platoon on standby.
-Breached site on rooftop. -Have Echo Platoon on standby.
Let the helo know we're moving external!
[gunfighter 1] Alpha, take port. Bravo, take starboard.
[gunfighter 2] Shift right. Shift right.
Cracking steel!
No!
[gunfighter 1] Hit him, hit him, hit him!
Fire.
[soldier on radio] Missiles out. Danger close.
He's running! Move!
[gunfighter 2] He's on the run! He's on the run!
No! Please!
Hold your fire. [groaning]
Hold fire!
Can you not see? I've been injured.
-[groaning] -[gunfighter] Box him in. Box him in.
Medical Officer Ratchet! I'm a friend!
I'm an Autobot!
Then why are you running?
Optimus sent this distress message.
[Optimus on speaker] Calling all Autobots.
We are under targeted attack.
Cease all contact with humans.
We're all hiding. All Autobots are being hunted.
We're all in danger.
I lost a sister in Chicago.
You'll get no sympathy from me.
What's wrong with you humans?
No! Please.
[gunfighter 1] Check fire, check fire!
He's mine now.
Lockdown.
Autobots, Decepticons.
Like little children, always fighting.
Making a mess out of the universe.
Then I've got to clean it up.
There is one way you survive. Tell me where he's hiding.
Where is Optimus Prime?
Never.
[Lockdown] Never is here.
I must say, it is remarkable, really astounding the success that the CIA has had
since you have taken operational control,
and so the President has asked me to ask you
to ask him,
to invite you both, uh, over to the White House just to powwow,
where we get maybe some more specifics about how
exactly you're hunting the enemy Decepticons left.
I've had my desk for two years.
Mr. Attinger has been here for 25. He runs the projects
for 25. He runs the projects where I don't ask for specifics.
That's why they're called Black Ops.
And why we all sleep better at night.
Check. That is great. So, um...
Any dirt on that? Uh, how, uh, that's going?
Outstanding.
Great. Oh, great.
I was hoping to hear that. The President will be pleased.
'Cause, I'll tell you right now, I've only been Chief of Staff since Monday,
um, but I do know that the alien war stuff, these are...
These are the only fun meetings.
[Attinger] Look, I'm not here to entertain the President,
but you may tell him that the war will be over.
Soon.
"...be over..." In case he asks, I just like to have an exact quote.
I just like to have an exact quote. "War will be over soon."
That is great. Such good news.
And, um, the President would, I know, just love...
And, um, the President would, I know, just love... Really, really love to press the flesh... Not flesh, obviously, but just maybe get a shot with, um...
but just maybe get a shot with, um...
Is it Lord Prime? Sir Prime?
We could bop on Air Force One.
It'd be just a quick bop, then we just bop in and bop back.
-[Attinger] I wouldn't get his hopes up on that one. -Okay.
[CIA director] He's called Optimus Prime. Alien combatant. Here illegally.
Alien combatant. Here illegally.
But aren't they our friends? Why?
Because our world will never truly be safe till all of them are gone.
Oh. Well, I would hope we could do a much more ceremonial farewell.
Especially since our military has worked so closely with them.
-Until you. -[Attinger] It's not their planet.
-Until you. -[Attinger] It's not their planet. Never was.
Time we take it back.
All right, come on. Come on.
Yes. Yes.
Oh, there you go.
No, hold it.
Stop shaking! Why are you shaking? You have the job!
Why are you shaking? You have the job!
You forgot to eat dinner!
You see why I worry?
Look, sorry, sweetie, I...
I almost got it working right.
So, listen, I'm done with homework and set with finals,
so I was just gonna take a little drive with some friends
-if that was okay with you. -[sighs]
No boys, I know. Graduate first.
Exactly.
You do know no one else has this rule, right? Rule? Don't make it sound harsh, okay. It's wisdom.
Rule? Don't make it sound harsh, okay. It's wisdom.
I don't think we need to be driving around in the middle of the night.
It's already like quarter to eight. It's almost dark.
Spud, will you stop it?
You know where I was for my graduation?
Yes. With me, the mistake.
The surprise, Tess. And the best thing that ever happened.
Do we look unhappy? Huh?
No. It's the greatest day of my life.
I made your mother a promise before she passed.
Our baby's gonna be at her graduation. That's it.
High school boys know nothing.
It's only later they turn into men.
So if you were older and wiser, I wouldn't exist.
That's not what I meant.
You know, this is a non-dating household, okay?
You don't date, I don't date. That's it.
Well, maybe you should.
Tessa, wait.
Tessa?
Look.
I know I've been on you, okay? But I have to be.
Twelve to seventeen is the official teenage danger window.
It's my job to get you through it. So you can be pissed off all you want.
And, yes, you can take a ride with your friends.
Okay.
Don't work all night.
And eat.
Best thing that ever happened, Emily.
She's the best thing that ever happened.
You'd be proud.
Oh, no.
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable. God!
Something in here needs to make this family some money.
Come on, you old wreck.
Judgment Day.
Where is he?
I don't know.
[barking] Intruder alert! Intruder alert!
Asshole.
I am dialing 911.
Tess, I'm basically your uncle.
Su casa es mi casa.
And we're going to lose the casa.
[Tessa] Dad!
Coming!
Are you working with lasers? If so, I'm not coming in.
You guys have never seen a truck like this before.
Get in here. Lock that door.
It doesn't have a lock.
Look! Look at the hole in the radiator. Look at the size of it.
Something blew a hole in it! Yeah, so?
It's not normal steel.
The shrapnel in the engine, it ripped all the connections apart.
And watch. And this took some Cade genius.
You are gonna love this.
When I hook this back to a working battery...
[Optimus] Calling all...
Calling all Autobots.
[Cade] Oh, yeah. I don't think it's a truck at all.
I think we just found a Transformer.
Tran... Ugh!
-[Lucas] Evacuate! -Wait! Guys!
Dad, are you out of your mind? You need to get that thing out of here.
You don't have to worry. I've been in there working all night. I'm fine.
You know what? That's not a truck, okay? You're right.
It's an alien killing machine. -Dude. It's DOA. -Jesus.
-Dude. It's DOA. -Jesus. It's been recalled, totaled, done.
So, listen, there's a number that you call.
You're supposed to call the government.
It's the American thing to do.
-Here we go. -You're supposed to call, and if it ends up being alien,
then you win $25,000.
You don't win money. And if you can capture it live...
Like tag it like a wild wildebeest, then you get $100,000.
-Dad, we're making the call. -I heard that.
I've seen the commercial. They don't say that. That's not a guarantee.
You think Greg would lie to me?
Look, if that's a Transformer there from the Battle of Chicago,
I need to know how it works.
I'm an inventor. This could be a game changer for me!
If I can apply that technology to my inventions,
we'd never have to worry about money again.
I've heard that before.
Twenty-five grand! It pays for my college. It pays for the house.
Besides, you used my money to buy the truck, right?
So technically, that's my truck. Don't you think?
You also signed a contract regarding all research lab I.P.
Research lab? It's a barn, dude.
You signed it and now you're competing.
Any idea of yours is mine. Any thought you have, I own it,
so basically, I own you.
I don't think you can own someone.
That was, like, a while ago, even in Texas.
All right. Bring the torch over -and help me with the pulley arm. -[Lucas groans]
I think the shrapnel took out its power core.
Oh, and, Tessa, you see this?
Would an alien killing machine let me do that?
Look, I'll make the call.
We'll get the money. Just first let me see if I'm right.
You want to hide in the house? Go ahead.
Okay.
Let's go. Pulley arm.
I can't believe him!
What is that? Looks like a missile.
What is that? Looks like a missile. [Cade] It is! Whoa!
[Tessa] Dad!
There's a missile in the family room!
-[clanging] -Holy...
I'll kill you!
No! No!
Dad, there's a missile in...
I'll kill you! Stay back!
-Oh, no. Don't shoot. Don't shoot! -Call 911! Run!
-Lucas! -Stop!
Lucas? Don't move, just calm down.
[Optimus] Easy, human.
Stay there. He's not going to hurt us.
Weapons systems damaged.
A missile hit your engine.
And we took it out of you.
You're hurt really bad.
I'm just trying to help you.
You're in my home now. I'm an engineer.
My name is Cade Yeager.
Cade, I am in your debt.
My name is Optimus Prime.
My Autobots.
They're in danger.
I need to go. I need to go now.
How far you think you're gonna get?
Tessa, come here. He needs our help.
What happened to you?
An ambush. A trap. Set by humans.
I escaped and took this form.
[Tessa] But you're on our side.
Why would humans hurt you?
They were not alone.
-My Autobots can repair me. -[Cade] Yeah.
If you can reach 'em.
What about me?
I warn you, Mr. Attinger of Earth,
an alliance is a contract, and contracts,
like humans,
expire.
On this planet, we have a saying. "The enemy of my enemy is my friend."
I also have a saying.
"I don't care."
So what happened in Mexico City?
I thought you had him.
Three direct hits. A mortal wound.
Then your men allowed him to escape.
You promised me human intelligence.
Or is there such a thing?
You know, you've still never told me.
Why do you want him? Who are you working for?
Every galaxy I've traveled, all you species are the same.
You all think you're the center of the universe.
You have no idea.
Go to the hardware store and you get the list. The whole list.
What, you're going to try and fix him? He's not a model train set, Cade.
No, that's right. He's important.
Yeah, but important to who? You can't keep an alien locked up in your barn.
What are you gonna do, play with him? -Will you calm down? -I'm trying to,
but I just got hit in the head with a ten-foot cannon!
If he eats you, I get the GTO.
Not a word to anybody. Do you hear me? Not a single word.
Nobody.
I think we have a lock on a high-value target.
Special Operations group is ready.
[Attinger] What do you got?
Sir, Special Ops just got a call from Paris, Texas.
Hard match on the truck seen leaving Mexico City.
Son of a bitch. Let's go get him.
Took a hell of a hit, you know.
The missile just missed your power source.
We call it a Spark.
It contains our life force
and our memories.
Yeah, we call it a soul.
Scramble Cemetery Wind.
Thank you for your efforts, ladies and gentlemen.
This room is going dark.
[Attinger] The exit is on your left.
-I'll take it from here. -Okay, let's go.
I'm with Cemetery Wind. We're on the move.
[on radio] Repeat, on the move.
Cade.
Why are you willing to help me?
I guess maybe because you trust me to.
I'm back!
Took you long enough!
My head hurts. I had to go to the doctor. I got a welt on my head
that makes me look like a freaking Star Trek character.
[scoffs] Whatever.
Look! Look!
[Savoy on speaker] We're on property.
[pilot] Viper 15 overhead. Angels 1.
Dad!
Mr. Yeager, my name's James Savoy. I'm a federal agent.
My men and I are trying to track down an abandoned truck.
It's a nice spread you got here.
Too bad she's for sale.
Well, thanks. She's not.
That the truck you mean?
Afraid not.
You know, Mr. Yeager, we received a call from someone concerned about this truck.
Oh, no.
That wasn't you?
Only thing I'm concerned about is you being on my property -without permission. -[laughs]
You know, we got a rule about people messing with people from Texas.
And I don't know what truck you're talking about.
The kind that cost American lives.
Search the property!
[Cade] What do you mean, "Search the property"? You don't have a warrant.
My face is my warrant.
Wait. But if you guys do find a truck, we get a reward, right?
[pilot on radio] Viper 15 holding, point alpha.
[agent 1 on speaker] Charlie team, hold tight.
[agent 2] Lock it down.
-Open, open, open. -Short wall. Short wall.
[agent 3] Five in. Five in.
[robot] Intruder alert! Back away from the premises.
[agent 2] What the hell is that? [agent 3] Just some dumb inventor. [agent 4] Clear.
[agent 5] Clear. [agent 6] Clear right.
[agent 7] Clear. [agent 8] 360. 720. Heads on a swivel.
Let's go. There's nothing here.
There's no signs. We got nothing.
Sir, we have a live armed missile in the trash.
Live? I carried that to the trash!
You told me that was a dud, dude.
I could be dead. Right?
Look. Okay, yes, I found a truck, all right.
I towed it back for the parts. I left it here last night. This morning, it's gone.
When? Where? I don't know. I swear to God. That's as much as I know about him.
"Him."
He said, "Him."
He knows who the son of a bitch is.
-Mr. Yeager. -What?
Excuse me.
You just said, "Him."
-Take them down. -What?
Ow! Let me go!
They don't know about the truck! I know!
Just let her go.
What kind of a man betrays his flesh-and-blood brethren for alien metal?
-Get this guy out of my sight. -[Tessa] Get off!
Let her go! They don't know about the truck.
All right! Load up! Search the perimeter! Lucas, you called, didn't you?
Lucas, you called, didn't you?
No! I don't know any of these scary guys.
Oh, God! You're manhandling a woman! I'll kick your ass!
Let her go!
-Daddy! Let me go! -You're not going anywhere.
-Daddy! -[grunts]
No! You're not taking me anywhere! I'm an American!
-Easy, sweetheart. -Okay, okay, okay. All right. Okay. All right. I was wrong.
Savoy. Use the girl.
Oh, my God! Ahh!
Now, you got ten seconds. Where's the truck?
-You're gonna shoot my little girl? -If I have to.
Please don't shoot me! Please!
Look, I don't know. I told you everything that I know! He's gone.
He left. He was in the barn, I swear to God!
-Just let her go! -[Tessa] Ow!
Please, please.
He was in there! Let her go!
Seven seconds.
[Cade] I'm telling you the truth! He was in there!
[Tessa] Dad!
[Cade] Tell him to get away from my little girl now!
[Tessa sobbing] Dad!
[Cade] You touch her and I'll kill you!
[Savoy] You got two seconds.
I need the truth.
Shoot her.
Here I am!
-[Cade] Get down! -Ahh!
[Optimus] Cade! They're going to kill you!
Get out of here!
Push right! Headed to the house!
Come on. Hurry up! Get in the car!
-Let's go! -Daddy, get in the car!
Perimeter, Optimus moving your way!
What's happening, baby? Who are they?
It's the truck. They want the truck!
"Who are they?" Who are you, and who are you calling "baby"?
I know you heard me.
-I'm her boyfriend! -He's my boyfriend!
What? You're not her boyfriend!
His name's Shane and he drives, Dad.
What kind of cars are those? They're so scary!
[Cade] There's another one coming up the back!
You gotta try to lose them in the cornfield!
He's coming up behind us! Go!
[pilot on radio] Viper 15, running on fumes. RTB.
They've got us cornered!
[agent] Watch out, watch out, watch out!
Mr. Yeager, this is not how I wanted us to meet, okay?
I'm Shane, and I'm a completely--
And I am not talking to you! Drive the car!
-[sirens wailing] -Watch out! Watch out!
[agent on radio] Throw 'em some warning shots!
Man, I don't know how I'm driving this good.
It's like, today I've gone to a whole other level.
Road, focus! Stop talking!
[Tessa] Shane, look out!
This may be primarily my fault, okay.
They said they were gonna bring a check!
I didn't know they were gonna send a death squad!
-Hang on! -[tires screeching]
[host] Hey, we got ourselves a winner! Don's got it over here. -[man] Look out! -[people screaming]
We lost them!
Good job, stranger from the cornfields!
The scary cars are back.
Lose them at the factory, Shane!
I thought you knew how to drive this thing! Go!
I don't think we're gonna get that money. Doesn't seem like it.
Cade!
Take 'em upstairs!
We're losing them on the fifth floor.
-Do that thing, Shane! -You know it.
What do you mean? What thing? What we're about to do is gonna be kind of scary.
What we're about to do is gonna be kind of scary.
Take out your guns and shoot them!
They're shooting at us! [grunting] -Tessa, grab my stick! Grab my stick! -What?
She's got the best hands in the business.
Ready, Tess? Pull!
-No! No! No! -No f-ing way!
Tessa, you are so grounded!
[Shane] Shit! The rim's cracked.
Optimus. Come on, move! Move!
My foot's stuck! Wait, Cade!
-Lucas! -Wait! Wait! [grunts]
[Cade] Lucas! Lucas, above you!
Run!
[Shane] Come on, get in, let's go!
[Attinger] I'll bet you wish you could see my face right now.
Lucas, we just left him?
He's gone.
My deepest sympathies for the loss of your friend.
Stay here till I'm sure we weren't followed.
We are all targets now.
So we're hiding out now? That's the plan?
We're taking orders from a truck?
Well, you got a better idea?
Hey, move away from her, kid. Don't...
Keep your hands off her. All right? No.
You got your ass kicked by a garage inventor from Texas.
That goes on your resume.
Yeah, it goes on all of yours, too!
Do I look like I'm in the mood for any of your shit today?
Washington thinks we were chasing a Decepticon target,
but our story falls apart if we don't find this Yeager family first.
Yeah, well, what if he goes to the cops or the FBI?
They know to hand him over.
His world as he knows it is gone.
Well, bright side, you guys met.
Where is he from?
I told you, he's a driver from Texas.
Texas?
Where, Dublin, Texas? Shamrock, Texas? So why does he sound like a leprechaun?
You'd get your ass kicked in Ireland for saying that.
Well, we're not in Ireland, Lucky Charms. We're in Texas.
And so he drives? What do you mean, he drives? Like, for a living?
Yeah. At least he makes a living.
Thank you.
[Shane] Look, I race rally cars.
One driver. One navigator. Her.
By the way, I'm totally legit. I just got picked up by Red Bull.
And just so you know,
my life savings was in that car back there.
This is not happening. [Shane] Oh, it definitely is.
How old are you?
20.
She's a 17-year-old girl.
So we can work this two ways.
One, I punch you right in the mouth and you call the police on me.
-[Tessa] Dad. -[Cade] Or two, I just call the cops on you
because this is illegal. She's a minor.
We're protected by the Romeo and Juliet laws.
[Tessa] We dated for a little while I was a sophomore, and he was a senior. It's fine.
No, it's not fine.
We've got a preexisting juvenile foundational relationship.
-Statute 2705-3. -What?
Texas statute?
-That a real law? -[Shane] Yep.
Romeo and Juliet, huh?
You know how those two ended up? In love.
Dead. Do your parents know about this?
Is your dad okay with you dating a 17-year-old girl?
He took off when I was five, but if I ever bump into him, I'll ask him.
You know, Tessa,
-I trusted you. -To what?
Never have fun, take a risk,
be a normal teenager, like you?
I am your father, okay? And I have been busting my ass to take care of you.
Is that what you were doing when you brought home the truck?
All you had to do was report it, and now Lucas is dead.
And my life is over. Thank you.
You've taken real good care of me.
[Tessa] Please don't shoot me!
Please! Dad!
They were willing to kill her.
Then they still are.
[Cade] Somebody somewhere gave that order. I'm going to find some fingerprints.
-[static crackles] -[Ratchet on video] Please!
No!
I'm an Autobot! I'm an Autobot!
[Cade] Grab whatever you think we can use for supplies.
Clothes, anything. And take that computer.
Let's go.
This is not easy.
[Tessa] You know, you don't suck at everything, Dad.
[gasps] What the...
[Cade] I knew it.
You told me he was no one.
Well,
this "no one" has our tech.
[Optimus on radio] Calling all Autobots. Calling all Autobots.
-Whoa! Oh, my God! -Oh, my God!
That was insane! It was awesome, but it was insane, right?
Oh, yeah! Hell, yeah!
He's back! He's alive!
Optimus is here!
At last. There is hope after all.
Mr. Leader of the Free Galaxy is back.
I knew you'd make it. I never doubted.
We got your warning. We've been waiting.
Hell, yeah. Boom time. We got the gang back together.
Humans have asked us to play by their rules.
Well, the rules have just changed.
Human beings, bunch of backstabbin' weasels.
Hound, find your inner compass.
Loyalty is but a flower
in the winds of fear and temptation.
What the hell are you saying? -It's a haiku. -Cut the crap,
before I drop a grenade down your throat. Try it, you'll be dead.
Oh, please pull it. Please do it.
You know what, it'll save us so much time.
Well, raise your hand if you're thoroughly disenchanted
with our little pleasant Earth vacation.
So, who's the stowaways?
Oh, whoa, hey, what's with the gun?
Stop. Hound, both of you.
They've risked their lives for mine.
[Optimus] We owe them.
So, there's been no sign of any others?
-[Hound] Nada. -We are all that's left.
[Crosshairs] They're picking us off, one by one.
We're the pathetic, dirty foursome. And you make five.
So that's our best-case scenario?
Autobot witness protection?
Hey, Speed Racer, you're welcome to leave anytime.
Well, for the record, Superdad,
I'm not hiding with you.
I'm hiding out with that big guy.
Sensei, with your fate unknown,
Bumblebee has held command,
despite his complete and total lack of anything resembling warrior discipline.
He's like a child.
This child is about to kick your ass.
He brings us shame.
[Hound] Cage fight.
[Drift] Smart-ass.
What's the matter with them?
Am I the lone sage who sees through
Am I the lone sage who sees through this puppy-dog eyes act? It's beneath you.
this puppy-dog eyes act? It's beneath you. Yes, I've been waiting
for them all to dispatch each other,
so I could take charge with no trouble at all.
Just me reporting to me.
Well, it sure looks like you've been missed.
Autobots, Lockdown is hunting us
and humans are helping.
We need to know why.
Well, listen, I don't know why,
but I have an idea about who.
This drone I stole recorded footage of an Autobot raid.
It's in pieces, but watch what happens here.
[Hound] Oh, that's Leadfoot.
[Cade] They rip him apart.
Savages.
[Cade] And later, this truck comes to haul him off.
KSI. Kinetic Solutions.
Defense, aerospace, government contracts. They designed this drone.
So these government guys just hunt you down, and then pass you off to this KSI?
[Cade] The company is headquartered in Chicago.
That could be where they were taken.
No way to get inside without a battle.
Well, what if you had some human help?
What, are you two partners now?
Sweetie, we're targets now, too.
We need to know why or we'll never get our lives back.
[Optimus] Autobots,
I have sworn to never kill humans.
Big mistake.
But when I find out who's behind this,
he's going to die. [Hound] Hooah!
[Cade] There's a full-on manhunt out for us, so we have some new rules.
Anyone who has got a badge is not our friend.
We're gonna divide and conquer.
You two in charge of stealing food and the essentials. And nothing else.
Chicago KSI headquarters is like a fortress.
I'm gonna find a way into their top-secret military wing.
Find something to blackmail this company and the government. We're gonna get our freedom back.
[all] Good morning, Mr. Joyce.
What was that sound?
That's "the" sound.
That you asked for.
No, I asked for boundless. Transcendent.
When you walk through a door in this building, it should sound like you've stepped into the future.
Present.
Say it.
[all] Future.
The past is history. The present is past.
[Joshua on PA] The future is now.
Why can't I get in touch with you?
Don't you realize what the Arctic find means?
You know that story we were all told as children
about a giant asteroid that struck the Earth
millions of years ago and wiped out the dinosaurs?
Vaguely.
[Darcy] We were wrong. This metal caused the great extinction.
How and why, I can't yet say.
But carbon dating puts it at 65 million years B.C.
This ore you've got us digging for is a lot more dangerous than you think. And my people...
Darcy, I think that you've been out in the field for far too long.
Why don't we discuss dinosaurs over dinner?
-Ribs? -Not a chance.
You have no idea what's been happening here.
We're about to make the quantum leap.
A rare-earth metal.
Molecularly unstable.
Industrial uses, none.
And then the aliens came. And we made the connection.
It's what they're made of.
[Wembley] It's the Holy Grail.
"Transformium." That's what we're calling it.
Focus-grouped. Catchy. -Trademarked. -Yeah.
This is the greatest advance in modern physics
This is the greatest advance in modern physics since the splitting of the atom.
It's programmable matter.
And now, we've mapped its genome.
-I. -Now you've mapped its genome.
And now we can begin to give it
instructions.
[Wembley] This is extremely good.
Watch this.
We can change anything into anything.
Sensual, almost. Don't you think?
Do you like music?
The Pill.
Perhaps something a little more violent?
Oh, my God. You've done it.
In aerospace, the military...
We will own the entire robotics industry.
All exploration. The oceans. Space. Everything.
Wembley. What is this?
The jellyfish commercial that you wanted. You said they were
erotic yet deadly, like women.
I never said that.
-Yes, you did. -No, I didn't.
I definitely heard you say it
'cause you were talking about your ex-girlfriend, who was sexy, but a bitch.
[Joshua] Please don't eat on the tour.
Is that her?
[Cade] Hey, I found a whole bunch of boxes of clothes.
So, sweetie, you can get some long pants, nice, loose-fitting ones,
So, sweetie, you can get some long pants, nice, loose-fitting ones, and lose the short shorts, okay?
What'd you guys get?
It's protein.
Look, I said the essentials, okay?
It wasn't easy. We almost got caught.
You stole mouthwash?
I like to be fresh when I'm making out with your daughter.
[Tessa] That's funny.
Yeah, that's not happening ever.
Ever? [chuckles]
This is our military prototype, Galvatron.
I don't understand it.
This is the fifth iteration.
Why does he keep turning out like this?
It's just some bugs in the final render.
[Joshua] I modeled Galvatron after Optimus Prime.
Why does he keep looking like Megatron?
[man on PA] Rendering sequence is almost finished. Stand by.
Simple coding.
Algorithms!
Math!
Why can't we make what we want to make,
the way we want to make it?
Why?
And does that look like a consumer-friendly face to you?
And what about that big hole in the chest?
I think it's bad-ass. I like it.
-Love it. -[Joshua] Well, I hate it.
Oh, here he is.
That bald-headed Doc Frankenstein.
Ma'am, this is not legal. This is illegal experimentation.
Aliens would never do this to people!
Eat you, kill you, maybe, but that's it.
This ain't right! Nobody puts baby in a box! Ahhh! [talking gibberish]
This is worse than waterboarding!
This little gentleman has been translating for us
This little gentleman has been translating for us all the information that comes from these two heads.
Their history, their science, everything.
-[Darcy] Is that Megatron? -[Joshua] Precisely.
Where did you get all these?
Special government contract.
Now we know everything about Transformers.
And now at long last we can build them ourselves.
And we can build them better.
Yeah, that's good, Bee. That'll get us in.
[Cade] A couple times a day, these guys are moving in vehicle shipments into KSI for something called "scanning."
in vehicle shipments into KSI for something called "scanning."
[Cade] Major security all over. So our best shot at getting in is a back classified research entrance.
I'm gonna drive in with Bee tomorrow morning.
[clears throat] Excuse me. There's no smooching in front of me, okay?
[Tessa] You're so square. Who even says "smooching"?
I tell you, no respect.
It's just impossible sometimes.
Yeah. I went through that with Bumblebee.
[Shane] Calm down. Calm down.
You know, at a time like this, the idea is to keep cool, not look cool,
so why don't you lose the glasses?
About a month ago,
middle of the night, I thought I heard noises in my house. Was that you?
What? Come on. No way.
Don't lie to me, kid. You see that guy with the gun out there?
There's so many guys with guns.
Let's get out of the car and tell him we're about to break in and it's your idea,
'cause I don't care. I'm old, I've already lived long enough.
You have a really bad habit of having these conversations at the wrong time, man.
You want to come clean or you want me to make a mess?
Sir, can I talk to you for a second, please?
It was me, it was me, it was me, it was me.
[sighing] I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Taking it in for scanning? -Uh-huh.
All right. You're good to go.
I'm literally gonna kill you.
[man on PA] Scanning in bay three.
[female announcer on PA] We took old, alien technology
and made it better in every way.
Introducing Stinger.
KSI. We make the world.
[Shane] That is a bad-ass robot.
-[Cade] he kind of looks like you, Bee. -[bumblebee revs engine]
Here is the past. And now the future.
They're trying to build their own versions.
Well, at least they're picking cooler cars than this. -[engine revs] -[horn honks]
[Bumblebee] You talk to me like that? [Shane] Bee, stop!
You see what happens from being a wise-ass?
-Now get out of here. -[coughing]
Stinger, inspired by Bumblebee...
-[engine revving] -[Shane groaning] ...but better in every way.
Son of a...
[Cade] No, no! You gotta calm down.
-[Shane] He's crazy! -Stop!
Bumblebee! Bee, stop going psycho!
Our factory does not have enough transformium for production
My delicate flower,
I can't understand you when you're angry.
Actually, I don't really understand you at all.
[scoffs] Our entire factory is up and running...
-[engine revving] -Excuse me one second. Hey! Hey, you two! Grease monkeys.
Hey, you two! Grease monkeys.
What the hell is going on here? Huh?
What's with this vintage crap?
We're not scanning collector car junk.
What do you think it is that we make here? Hmm?
We make poetry. We're poets.
All right? You work for me, you get one mistake. One. Understood?
-It won't happen again. -It certainly won't.
So let's get this pathetic thing out of here.
And you, too.
So sorry. So sorry.
Let's move on.
Watch him. I'm going to see what I can find.
Quietly get out of here.
[Joshua] I swear. I swear.
I can't bear it when you're angry.
You know how it upsets me.
Bee, you gotta calm down right now.
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
You gotta breathe, or just do whatever it is that you do.
I'm calm. I'm calm. I'm not even touching it.
-Okay, I'm barely touching it. I'm barely touching it. -Oh, my God.
Turn back into a car right now!
Get out of my face, all right?
[male announcer on PA] Our design team started with
the Bumblebee.
But really, this alien's design was decrepit
But really, this alien's design was decrepit and, let's face it, antique.
and, let's face it, antique. What the [bleep].
-Don't take it personally, Bee. -Kind of old and ratty.
You mean ugly.
Oh, hell, no!
No! No!
You think you're better than me!
What did you touch?
My office in 15 minutes.
[female tech] This is dissection room seven.
Galvatron, render postmortem number 12.
Continued head disfigurement at event number 32.
So what about the deal? Is it done?
Did you get the Seed?
-We get it when the bounty hunter gets Prime. -Uh-huh.
Meanwhile, there has been a complication.
A what?
At KSI, we don't use words like that.
A civilian harboring the Autobots has hacked into one of your mini-drones.
Meaning, they may know of your involvement.
What?
[sighs] That was a little bit intense.
I need more Transformium, and I need it now, to build more prototypes.
and I need it now, to build more prototypes.
You tell your alien bounty hunter
that I have staked my company on this deal.
And I have merely staked my life.
Hey, you came to me on this, remember?
Hey, you came to me on this, remember? You retire from the CIA,
you get a seven-figure piece of my company, and you and I
you get a seven-figure piece of my company, and you and I revolutionize national defense together.
But, Attinger, buddy, for both our sakes,
you need to deliver
the Seed.
[Cade] I'm in. Can you see my camera?
They're melting Ratchet.
They slaughtered Ratchet!
I'm gonna tear them apart!
[Darcy] Metal.
Just metal. That's what I always thought of them.
Well, they're not. They're living things, with souls like ours.
Once, I spoke to one.
And you're working with Transformium?
Uh, yeah, that's what I do. I am.
I'm out there digging for it. There's just not much left to find.
So that's how badly you boys need more, huh?
Reduced to melting evil old Decepticons down.
No. That's an Autobot there.
The ones who fought for us.
-I've got this taken care of from here. -Right.
Same badge code scanned at two separate gates.
I'm having the classified area locked down now.
Check that guy.
Stop right there!
Stop!
Freeze!
-[brakes screeching] -Up against the wall.
Corporate espionage.
That's a very serious crime, Mr. Yeager.
[Cade] Look, I want a lawyer.
The Justice Department. Somebody I can trust.
I'm just trying to protect my family, okay? Not from your company, from the government.
Mr. Yeager,
who do you think I work for?
You're trying to protect your family, that's admirable.
I'm trying to defend the nation from alien war.
We've had a taste of what that looks like, and we are not gonna tolerate another. Now...
and we are not gonna tolerate another. Now... There is a version of this conversation
where you get to go back to your barn,
your daughter gets to graduate with honors, and life as you know it will go on.
You have no idea what you're involved with here.
Really?
What's the other version of this conversation?
The one when you send in the hired help to murder my little girl?
Or you gonna man up and do it yourself?
What's your preference?
I'm going to ask you this once.
Where is Optimus Prime?
[Bumblebee] Come on. Let's get out of here.
We're moving. Basement.
They're here.
[Optimus] Get out! All of you!
[Hound] Science fair's over, meatbags!
-[Optimus] Destroy the lab! -Move, move, move, move!
Look out! Look out!
Destroy it all!
Guys! It's me! Break me out of this Frankenstein box!
Stop!
That's company property!
They're not your property!
They were my friends.
Oh, you ain't talking so much now! You got Hound in front of you, huh?
Go ahead.
Show us your true colors, once and for all.
Just give me the word, I'll splatter him.
Why don't you tell Itchy Fingers here
that this is all the spoils of war. Dead metal.
Innovation. What we do here is science.
Because if we don't do it, somebody else will.
Because you cannot stop technology!
We're not your technology!
Let me vaporize his ass.
I broke the code. I own your whole genome.
The world will know what you're doing here.
The world? The world will approve.
We can make you now.
Don't you get it? We don't need you anymore.
[Hound] That was cruel.
Autobots,
we're done.
We're done? We're not gonna kick a little bit of ass?
[Hound] I've been itching to kill something lately.
This is our chance. We have to stop him. You have to stop him.
It's never been tested in the field.
Labs, military bases, but not on civilian streets.
Down there a Defense Department contract was just attacked in a terrorist attack.
was just attacked in a terrorist attack.
This is now a CIA military op.
You're indemnified. Respond!
Let's go.
KSI Chicago, closest live sat, patch it in.
Been an unprovoked Autobot attack.
Bring up Galvatron.
Transforming Galvatron.
[female voice] Galvatron coming online.
Bring up Stinger.
[female voice] Stinger coming online.
Let's show these alien terrorists
what an upgrade looks like.
[air force operator 1] Galvatron and Stinger are moving to intercept targets.
[air force operator 2] Reapers. Five targets in the open. Good picture.
Two miles to intercept.
[standing air force operator] 200 meters.
Engage.
Transform.
We are programming this, right?
Yes. Mostly.
[air force operator 3] Systems seem to have malfunctioned.
Targeting five bogeys.
Engaging rockets.
Missiles away.
Gotta haul ass, Bee! Come on!
[air force operator 1] Stinger is in pursuit.
Misfire, misfire! Misfire, misfire!
System failure. Galvatron just fired four rockets.
Whoa! They're shooting at us!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! -Watch out! What are you doing?
What was that?
We need a full medical team now. Possible civilian casualties.
I mean, you got a lot of people in the crossfire here. I don't like...
You're making history here. For your country, for the world.
Human freedom is at stake.
Innocent people die all the time.
Come on, Optimus!
Tessa!
Make him fight. Don't let him go down. Make him fight!
[Shane] Come on, come on. Come on, come on.
-[gasps] -[Cade] Tessa! Tessa!
Tessa, run to the field!
You have no soul!
That is why I have no fear!
-[both grunting] -You die!
Help me!
What is that?
That's my asset. Pull Galvatron back.
Do it.
I got to go get her.
[Cade] Tessa!
Don't go out there! He'll kill you!
-She needs my help! -She's hidden!
Optimus! Optimus, get up, get up!
I can't. Get out of here.
I feel sorry for you, Prime.
Your allegiance to these humans.
The trouble with loyalty to a cause is that the cause
will always betray you.
Who sent you here?
Where do you think you came from?
[scoffs] You think you were born?
No. You were built.
And your creators want you back.
We all work for someone.
No, no.
It's got her! -She's in the car! -Tessa!
-She's in the car! -Tessa! -No! -Tessa!
-No! -Tessa!
[Tessa] Dad!
Tessa, get out!
Get out!
Tessa!
Get out! Tessa!
Get out! Tessa! Dad, help me!
-Tessa! -Help me, help me! Dad! Dad!
Dad!
-Dad! -Tessa! Break the glass! -Break the glass to get out! -I'm trying!
-Break the glass to get out! -I'm trying!
-Tessa, I can't hold on! -Dad!
Tessa! -Help me! -Just break it! Break the glass!
-Help me! -Just break it! Break the glass!
[Optimus] Cade, warn the Autobots!
Dad, help me! Don't leave me!
No!
[Lockdown] Take that human to the trash.
My team is on the way. This is a CIA operation.
This is my asset.
Tell the military to stand down. Hang on, I have the White House.
[chief of staff] Agent, hello!
Oh, my goodness. Boy, is it a flurry of excitement over here at the White House.
Everybody is super, super mad. At me.
So, I went over my notes from our last meeting,
and I'm not sure when you said anything about
a "giant alien warship over Michigan Avenue."
Tell the President this is not an attack.
Remember this ship, Prime?
Built for all you Knights, you great crusaders,
to explore the universe.
Well, I commandeered it. It's my personal prison now.
Optimus?
Welcome back to the Knights' Temenos, Prime.
You have disgraced it.
Join your fellow rebels, fugitive scum.
It's for the rarest of specimens.
The worst of the worst.
It's taken centuries,
but I've collected all the Knights but you.
The creators want to sweep their chessboard clean.
I'm slave to no one.
All this species mixing with species.
It upsets the cosmic balance.
The creators, they don't like it.
They built you to do what you were told.
[Shane] Why hasn't it taken off yet?
Come on, Bee, it's descending. You got to get on it!
[Attinger on phone] Savoy, mission accomplished. Lockdown has Prime. The deal's going down now.
Lockdown has Prime. The deal's going down now.
Picking up the Seed at the recon point.
[agent on radio] Nest, Talon. L.Z. appears clear.
[Lockdown] Much as I've enjoyed the hunt,
I won't miss your wretched planet.
Our deal is done. One Prime for one Seed.
Handle it with care.
I trust your species is ready.
Don't worry about our species.
Farewell, Earth.
[Cade] Come on, come on!
Bee, come on!
It's a bad idea. But I'm all about bad ideas.
Let's go!
[Crosshairs] Well, let's rock.
This is crazy.
Look, you wanna cut and run, you better do it now. I'm gonna die trying.
Hey, I'm not here to help you get your daughter.
You're here to help me get my girlfriend.
Engage dark-matter drives. Full power.
[Hound] We're behind enemy lines now.
Lockdown's ship has booby traps.
Eyes open.
Beware of his bone grinders, brain blinders, flesh peelers,
Beware of his bone grinders, brain blinders, flesh peelers, chromosomal inverters,
catatonic sludge, black hole trapdoors,
and, of course, radiation.
We must be quick. We have the element of surprise.
Let's try to use violence as a last resort.
Oh, get it! I kill you! Kill you!
[Crosshairs] Ugh. I hate those things. That's freaky.
He's not alive anymore.
Well, we looked. They're not here. Let's go.
What? Hey, I'm not going anywhere without Tessa.
I'm unclear. What's in it for me?
I'm unclear. What's in it for me? What's in it for you?
Easy. Let's use words.
What's in it for you is I don't kill you.
We're getting the boss back. And the girl. Copy?
Okay, okay. Very persuasive. Textbook machismo.
Well, then. We'll need to sabotage something.
Better hurry. Because dark-matter drives are preparing to take off.
Oh, wonderful.
I give us 10 minutes.
Is that what that sound is? The engines filling up?
Are you telling me that thing's gonna be...
This is gonna be flying out of here in 10 minutes?
-[Drift] Uh-huh. -Ten minutes? Could be nine. Worst case, seven.
Could be nine. Worst case, seven. Humans, search the cell blocks.
[Cade] We're wasting time, let's go.
[Hound] We'll find the center core.
Let's move.
We're gonna stop this nightmare ship.
[Cade] We're never gonna find her in this huge ship.
Like a needle in a haystack.
Tessa!
Great. Great.
Oh, that was smooth.
No, that was really smooth, letting everybody know we're here.
Now they're gonna be looking for us.
[Drift] Better hurry, Crosshairs,
before we go into space!
Ah. Here's the little jujube right here.
Hello, Mama.
Who fired the anchors?
Who's on my ship? We have a loose prisoner.
[Cade] Hurry up.
We got like six minutes.
We'll find her.
Hold up.
Back up.
Come on, those things are gonna find us. Hurry, hide.
Weapons!
Come here. Help me. Hurry, hurry.
Help me up.
There are some weird sounds out there.
-What is that? -I don't know.
You ready?
-Run. -[weapons firing]
All right, we're not going down without a fight.
They turn that corner, and we're gonna take them. You ready or
They turn that corner, and we're gonna take them. You ready or -you gonna bitch out on me? -No, I got your back.
-Are you ready? -Absolutely.
[Cade] Don't bitch out on me. Are you ready?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Whoa, okay! I surrender! I surrender! I surrender!
I'm so sorry! I'm so, so, so sorry!
What'd you do? How'd you do that? I have no idea!
You no-good, chickenshit little rat!
Look at that. You see that? Oh! Whoa!
You stay here, Lucky Charms!
Oh, man. I am so gonna patent this shit.
[Cade] Tess!
Dad! Help me!
Hey! -Tess? -Tess!
[Cade] Come on, move, move!
Tessa!
Shane, I love you! I love you! You saved me! You saved me!
[Shane] I know. I know.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Thank you. You saved me. Oh, yeah, he saved you. Yeah.
I think you and Mr. "I Surrender" have a lot to catch up about, sweetie.
He saved me, too. You should have seen him in there.
I mean, our hero. Let's go. Now.
Eyes open. [Crosshairs] I almost got it.
[Hound] Big boy coming through! Move, move, move.
[Hound] This has got to be the Supermax.
Watch the corners.
There's a lot of cages.
[Hound] Oh, yeah. Creepy critters in here.
[Crosshairs] I don't want to know what's in the big cage.
What's this? Hound, don't do it.
Aw, you don't look very dangerous in there.
Oh, that's festering ugliness.
I'm hit! I'm down! It's melting! It burns!
Ugh, I think it's acid!
Ah, nuts. It's just shizzle.
I hope that's not contagious.
I got to hurt you now.
You're just too disturbing to live.
Take that, bitch!
Oh! You're dead. -[Optimus] Hound! -He's alive!
-[Optimus] Hound! -He's alive!
[Crosshairs] Hold on, boss, we're coming! -[Hound] Optimus, sound off! -In here, quick!
-[Hound] Optimus, sound off! -In here, quick! Hang on, we're coming for you!
The arms of this Knight Ship detach!
We can break free! It's a separate ship!
-Hurry! -Where's the cockpit? Right or left?
-Right! -I'm on it, boss.
Hurry. We have no time.
[Drift] Sensei.
Let's rock! I always wanted to fly one of these things.
I'm there, boss!
Hey, Yeager Technologies,
you gonna invent us a way out of this one?
Whoa. Oh, my God.
I am not doing this.
-I am not doing that. -Yes, we are.
No, it's good. It's stable. Come on.
No way. Sweetie, you know why I'm here? I'm here to protect you.
Sweetie, you know why I'm here? I'm here to protect you.
You've done great at that.
I want you to trust me right now. We're getting down. Let's go.
Don't look down, okay? Step. See, it's easy. Come on.
[Shane] Careful, these cables are starting to get thinner here!
[Cade] Step. Step. There. [Tessa] Oh, my God!
[Cade] See, don't look down! All right? Don't look down.
We're gonna be at the building in no time!
You okay, Tess?
[Cade] Keep stepping.
[Tessa] Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Dad! Oh!
All right, sweetie. You need to keep moving here, okay?
-Come on! -[Tessa] I can't.
I'm freaking out.
You need to move now!
I'm not moving! I'm going back to the ship!
-[yelping] -[Cade] Oh, shit!
-You can't go back to the ship, honey! -Watch me!
You are not 18 years old yet.
And you're gonna do what I say! Now let's go!
We need to go this way, okay. Not that way.
Talk to her, Romeo! Now!
Come on, for God's sake.
Do not start with me.
Oh, my God, what is that?
All right, Tessa. Don't look back.
Well, don't say that to me. Now I want to turn around.
It's nothing major, sweetie.
Well, that means it's totally major!
I'm gonna have to point this gun in your direction.
It's gonna feel like it's in your direction, but I'm not.
-You better hurry. -Are you trying to kill me?
I had to bust my ass to get up here on this spaceship!
-Shoot it! -Get down now!
Tessa, wait! I'm coming for you! Tessa! Oh!
-[Tessa] Oh, my God! -[Cade] I'm coming!
-[Tessa] Oh, my God! -[Cade] I'm coming! Hold on!
You're the best, Bee! You are the best.
You damn right! And don't ever forget it.
You see that? Look at me! We're off the ship, right?
[Crosshairs] Bumblebee! Bumblebee! Friendly!
Enemy ships are coming in hot. Get on! Get on!
Hold your knickers, I'm punching it!
They got three ships on them!
I'm giving it the juice! [grunts]
Come on, Bee, take them out!
Good move, Bee!
This one's for you, A-holes!
If you're gonna do something, you better do it!
[Cade] Come on!
I'm sick of this crap. You fly. I shoot.
Hey, you better let me fire this big-ass gun
-and make this ship go faster! -Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Listen up! Crash course. Tracer guns.
Punch forward to fire, slide back to reload.
What?
Punch, hold, slide, repeat. Punch, hold, slide, repeat.
Wait. What're you talking about?
-I don't know what he means. -Good luck.
Where are you going?
To lay some hate.
-Say it! -Okay.
[both] Punch, hold, slide, repeat. Punch, hold, slide, repeat.
-Go! -[grunts]
Yeah, I got one! Whoo!
These alien guns kick ass!
Come on, he's on us!
Bee, you gotta move! Duck!
[Cade] Bee, fire the gun!
[Shane] That was insane!
[Cade exhales] Tess, you okay?
Okay. Sir?
You better have insurance!
Insurance?
It's a freaking spaceship.
You go get insurance on a freaking spaceship.
Good luck with that, buddy.
Is this your car? Huh?
Sweetie, hand me my alien gun.
-Trust your dad. -Okay.
Prepare for interstellar launch.
We're almost ready to separate. We're almost there.
-[Optimus] Hurry, he's launching! -All over it, chief.
Lockdown will be in deep space before he realizes I'm gone.
I'm a sucky pilot, but let's give it a whirl.
You CIA guys are really subtle. What a deft hand. I'm sure nobody noticed all that.
What a deft hand. I'm sure nobody noticed all that.
Look. In a few minutes, there are gonna be feds all over this place, and I don't want them
all over this place, and I don't want them finding our Holy Grail.
So we're gonna take all our R&D, we're moving it to our China facility. Yeah.
I want you to bring me the Seed,
but I want you to bring it to me there.
Mr. Joshua, I would not describe
Mr. Joshua, I would not describe your product testing as perfected.
We have plenty of time for improvements in China.
Sir, Galvatron. He was...
Sir, Galvatron. He was... [Joshua] A fiasco.
A farrago. An embarrassment.
And he spoke. How did that happen?
Do you know what a flaw is, Wembley? A flaw?
A flaw is a total failure.
I did not have control over my prototype,
and I want to know why!
Let's give Bumblebee the good news.
We got a ship now. We're leaving.
You humans. After all we have done.
You don't know what you've wrought upon yourselves.
[Cade] What? What is it now? What are you talking about?
I mean, I'm doing stuff out of my league here!
You don't see who's controlling who.
Within that man-made prototype I fought,
I sensed the presence
of Megatron.
What, the Decepticon that started the Chicago war?
How do you think KSI built those bots in the first place, hmm?
They had a whole mess of dead Decepticon heads and they were downloading their minds!
dead Decepticon heads and they were downloading their minds!
And I was in charge of autopsy duty.
No union, no benefits, no nothing.
They hooked me up to Megatron,
and that mind wasn't as dead as they thought.
He fed them the science and specs!
All so they could build him a brand-new body.
Then he infected it with his evil, nasty chromosomes.
They had red, beady eyes. [exclaims]
They got all in my lovely locks.
Oh, I can smell it right now.
Total inside custom job!
KSI might have named the body the snappy name of Galvatron,
but that's just Megatron reincarnated!
You knew this and you didn't warn them?
Little girl, you can go to a pretty dark place when you on death row.
He's been playing KSI all this time,
all so that he could manipulate them into going after the Seed.
Wait. The Seed?
Those nasty soldiers that were chasing us.
I saw them board the ship, and they took something
that they called the Seed.
Listen. Sixty million years ago, give or take an eon--
Thousands of planets were cyber-formed with Seeds.
They turned your organic life into our elemental metals.
Our creators destroyed your world to make us.
And that's what Galvatron wants to happen again.
He wants to detonate that Seed in the biggest city and kill millions!
in the biggest city and kill millions!
He's gonna show the world, "Baby, I'm back."
[Optimus] The blast wave will incinerate that city into molten metal.
He'll have enough to build a massive army
and annihilate your species forever.
You dumb, greedy bastards just brought extinction to yourself.
Not my problem, though. [scoffs] I'm free at last. Whole thing worked out good for me. I'm walking.
I'm free at last. Whole thing worked out good for me. I'm walking.
We got to get the Seed before Galvatron does.
[Joshua] The Seed is going to be the salvation of our company.
We take delivery tonight. And next month, we detonate safely
And next month, we detonate safely in the Mongolian desert.
And we'll create enough Transformium
for a hundred years.
Dad, I'm tired of running and stealing.
Dad, I'm tired of running and stealing. Well, a place to sleep.
Well, a place to sleep.
Yeah. Just another break-in.
[Cade] You know, when I was your age,
I liked to get a little wild. I liked cars, girls.
But then there was Tessa.
And when she was born, all I ever wanted out of life was for her to be happy and healthy and safe.
was for her to be happy and healthy and safe.
Somehow I thought I'd always be enough to protect her.
But I won't be.
I'll never be.
So somebody better be.
Thanks for being here today, Lucky Charms.
Well, thanks for not shooting me when you had the chance.
Oh, I'll have more.
Yeah, I can see that.
We've intercepted the encrypted communications.
Joshua Joyce is headed to his factory in Guangzhou, China.
Hey, big shot.,
Your company's in serious trouble.
You better have a damn good lawyer.
Really? Well, you better have
a great one 'cause you're about to be
a great one 'cause you're about to be responsible for the annihilation of a city.
Now, you listen to me.
Your tech has been hacked. Your prototypes are infected.
And now Galvatron is after that Seed.
Look. I know you have a conscience
because you're an inventor, like me.
Do not let Galvatron anywhere near that Seed.
I control Galvatron. I created him.
Deep down, I know you know.
Your prototype's been controlling you.
How fast can that thing get us halfway around the world?
Very. It's a spaceship.
If we're traveling, now's the time.
All I want is to have our life back.
It's your call. Whatever you want.
Are we safer on our own, or are we safer with them?
She's a keeper.
Must take after her mom.
I can't argue with that, kid.
Move! We're retrieving the Seed,
but then we're done defending the humans.
What, done? What do you mean, you're done?
[Crosshairs] Means "finished," "see ya," "good-bye."

Absolutely, sir.
Joyce.
I cannot tell you how enthused I am to deliver this.
Top of your alien wish list.
It's yours. Or rather ours.
I will need to see my advance.
[Attinger] Five million shares of the company.
Together, we're gonna end human warfare.
We're about to build a fully automated U.S. Army.
Just think of all the American lives we're gonna save.
So how soon until we can start continuous production?
You know, why don't we take a beat on this for a minute?
I have some new data that I discovered and--
You're not backing out on me here?
No, I'm not backing out. I just...
I want the Seed. I'm not saying I don't want the Seed. I'm just saying
want the Seed. I'm just saying I don't know if I... If I want the Seed right now.
Good men have died trying to get that thing for us.
Good men have died trying to get that thing for us. For you.
I know what you did to get that thing.
A lot of illegal, icky shit.
I can take you down, too, Mr. Black Ops.
Don't you threaten me.
I started this company when I was a boy,
with a dream of making the world a better place.
Funny. I had the same dream.
Somewhere along the way, you made billions of dollars.
So why don't you tell me what's missing from my dream? Why don't you tell me what's missing
from my dream? Why don't you tell me what's missing from my boyhood dream?
I have served my country for decades
I have served my country for decades of unparalleled prosperity
and you are my golden parachute.
So you are damn well jumping out of the plane with me!
I am Galvatron!
What's going on?
Your Galvatron has gone active.
What haven't you been telling me?
Find Darcy, and bring a car around downstairs. Quietly.
We got a factory emergency. I have to get you out of here.
-What the hell's going on? -Take them outside.
We had a deal. You got what you wanted.
I got what "it" wanted.
My brothers, today I grant you your freedom.
And from now on, you are commanded by me.
Rise up!
Go find my Seed!
Detonate the Seed in the largest city.
Listen, princess. I don't wanna hear, "I told you so,"
but this is much more dangerous
-than I think. -Get in.
Galvatron's hacked into the others. -What? -Joshua.
-What? -Joshua. -You have to contain this! -Drive, drive!
[Attinger] Son of a...
Come on. Let's move, let's move, let's move!
I know how to lose them in Hong Kong.
I know a military garrison there that will help us.
Threatening a professional CIA killer.
Possibly not my finest hour.
I'd like to have that one back.
Killer? I thought they were your friends!
No. Not friends. Business. They gave me this bomb.
-Bomb? -Oh!
Is there a bomb in the bag?
Yes, there's a bomb in the bag.
Shit.
[Cade] When you said you were done fighting for humans,
you didn't mean that, did you?
How many more of my kind must be sacrificed
to atone for your mistakes?
Well, what do you think being human means? That's what we do.
We make mistakes.
And sometimes out of those mistakes
come the most amazing things.
When I fixed you, it was for a reward.
That was it. That was why. For money.
And it was me making a mistake.
Without it, you wouldn't be here.
So even if you got no faith in us,
I'm asking you to do what I do.
I'm asking you to look at all the junk and see the treasure.
You gotta have faith, Prime, in who we can be.
I'm seriously pissed we're not getting paid for this.
Well, at least we get to kill him.
They're not getting away if I still got him on satellite.
Some genius. Thinks he can outrun the CIA.
-[Darcy] Joshua? -[Joshua] Yes?
How lethal is that bomb?
Uh, I don't know. Let me check.
I love this! This is so good. Oh, hang on.
I'm getting a text from Il Duce in Hong Kong.
"Need to know the Seed's estimated blast range."
I'll do the diversion! Get that thing somewhere safe!
[speaking in Mandarin] How much is this?
[speaking in Mandarin] What's up? [speaking in Mandarin] I want to buy your motor. Here you go.
[speaking in Mandarin] Buy my motor?
Killers are coming! Guys, we gotta go!
Guys, guys...
-Shut up! Shut up! -All right! I'm sorry!
All right, go ahead, go ahead!
Okay, good? No, don't go! Wait!
Okay, he's in. Okay, okay, okay.
I need a raise! I want a raise.
All right, yes! I'm sure whatever you want!
[Joshua] Go, go, go!
Oh, no!
Death is on our tail! Death is on our tail!
Get out of the way, all of you! Get out of the way!
I don't want to die like this.
Box them in.
Hurry, hurry! Come, come. Okay, yes. I'll follow you anywhere. You're amazing!
Okay, yes. I'll follow you anywhere. You're amazing!
We're going to get you to the roof.
Good, good.
Go!
I can't... This is really happening. A man, me, who is worth over 20 billion dollars is now...
A man, me, who is worth over 20 billion dollars is now...
being chased by CIA assassins. That's the truth.
[laughing] And in the middle of a robot uprising.
And I'm carrying what is, in essence, a tactical nuke.
And the great thing is I... The great thing is that I'm...
I'm barely feeling any jetlag.
-Just stop it! -What?
You need to hide on the roof of this building.
I'll get you a helicopter extraction.
Okay.
I like her.
I find her very attractive.
[mercenary] He's definitely around here.
Come on, come on.
I got a bike!
Check in there!
These are the CIA assassins I told you about.
-Whoa! Guys. -[mercenary] Let's go.
Hello.
Hey! Okay.
-Pick it up. -All right. I'm gonna.
Wow. Wow, thank you. Wow! How did you...
Police training, prior to my MBA.
I love you.
Get to the roof. All right, okay.
Find my Seed. It's here!
Those prototypes are after that bomb.
No!
No, no, no, no!
Who the hell's aboard that?
Impossible.
Brothers, it's the Autobots! Shoot them down!
[Cade] Joshua!
[Hound] Hey, Baldy!
Hey, it's me! Hey!
Bring it over now! Let's go.
Hurry up, run!
-Hurry! Come on! -[Hound] Let's go! Move it!
Guys! Come on. Give it to me now!
[Hound] Looks like we might have company.
[Hound] We're hit! We're hit!
[Attinger] They live, they talk, we're dead.
Kill them all.
Pleasure.
[Hound] I count ten below!
I thought you said you had one prototype get infected.
Now he's got operational control of my other 50.
Come on.
Climb, climb!
Surround them.
I may have started the apocalypse,
but you brought your family.
And that's, you know, terrible parenting.
Oh, I'm about one second away from knocking you out, taking the bomb, and just leaving you here.
Please, do me a favor.
Optimus, Autobots, you alive?
-Come on, bitch! -[Cade] Come on!
[Hound] Evac! Evac!
We're getting flanked!
We got company below!
[grunts] My fat ass is stuck! Bee, take the shot!
-Into the elevator! Get in. -Okay. Come on.
Get down, get down!
Close the door! Close the door!
-[alarm blaring] -Won't go! It's not closing!
There's too much weight.
-Get back down to Bumblebee! -Dad, no!
Hey! You want me!
Center elevator.
Center elevator.
He's gonna be okay.
Alien bomb! Alien bomb, coming through!
Clear the way! Clear the... Hi, kids.
Coming through, ladies!
Excuse me! Excuse me, ladies! Excuse me!
Oh, my God!
How do you say, "Get the fuck out of the way" in Chinese?
[Savoy] That's a long way down.
You've got to be kidding me.
I'm coming for you!
Never should have hidden that truck.
You should have never came after my family.
Tough luck, Yeager. We all have family.
Yeah, but I'm gonna live to see mine.
[Lockdown on radio] Where is my escaped bounty?
Autobots at this location.
Prime is close.
Do whatever you have to do.
I intend to.
-Darcy! -Joshua!
[Shane] We got three more coming in from that way!
[Cade] Bee, where's Tessa?
Dad!
We got a real dilemma here. Okay?
I created incredible robots.
It's all designed to kick that fat Transformer's ass.
So, really, this is a no-win situation.
It's over.
That was mean.
Hey! I'm sorry if you can't handle the cold-hearted truth!
[Hound] Optimus, what are my orders with these humans?
Can I squish the bald guy?
They're in trouble.
Nah! This isn't our fight!
I'm done being an underdog. Underdogs suck!
I say they get what they deserve.
What's the play, Prime?
It's time for reinforcements.
Recognize one of your Knights.
The legend exists.
All right, come on! Come on, let's go!
Bee, go!
Come on, we got to move! Let's go, move!
Where's Tessa? Tessa, get over here! Come on.
Get over here!
[Hound] Stay behind me! I'm covering you!
If I stop covering you, it means I'm dead. But that ain't gonna happen.
Take that!
I'm a wicked warrior robot!
Goddamn! Come on! We gotta move now!
Go, go!
We got hostiles coming down the street!
Go!
Bee! Twelve o'clock! Cover fire!
[Joshua] We're surrounded!
Hustle, hustle, hustle!
Rocket!
Go, go, go! Get down!
Oh, this is the perfect place to hide. A big glass box!
Nobody will ever find us here! That's... [grumbling]
You've got to be kidding me.
Legendary warriors, the powers that created us
now want us all extinguished.
We must join forces, or else forever be their slaves.
So today you stand with us...
...or you stand against me.
We'll let Prime figure this one out.
Very wise.
There's no friggin' way I'm staying down here with them.
No way. No way.
Only together can we survive!
Let me lead you!
Oh, no.
I was expecting a giant car.
[Optimus] Come here!
We're giving you freedom.
You defend my family,
or die.
Autobots,
we're going to prove who we are
and why we're here!
Ugh, you just want to die for the guy.
That's leadership. Or brainwashing, or something.
No. That's Optimus Prime.
Autobots, we charge together!
Now, roll out!
We're getting boxed in! We're getting flanked everywhere!
Help me out here! Kill anything that moves!
Come on, Cade, shoot!
Come and get some, you little bitch!
Incoming! [grunts]
I can't believe I'm putting my life in your hands.
Here. Be my guest. Take the gun.
-No, I don't want the gun. -Go ahead, take it. Come on, you can lead. -No, I don't want the gun. -Then stay under there
-No, I don't want the gun. -Then stay under there -and shut up! -All right.
[Joshua] You're good with the gun. So you keep it.
Running out of guns and ammo.
Come and get some!
You're all gonna die!
[Hound] Way to go, baby!
Good shooting, Cade!
I'm like a fat ballerina
who takes scalps and slits throats!
Got your fortune cookie!
Come here, you little punk.
Pull the pin! I'm dying out here!
Here! Take it. Take it!
-[Hound] Little help! Little help! -[ticking]
It's live! It's live, it's live. Take it!
What do you want me to do with it?
-Just throw it! -Give, give, give!
[Hound] Got some bad news, Cade.
I'm out of ammo and out of ideas.
Faster! Go!
I'll kill you!
No, impossible!
They're ruining everything!
Take that!
Get off me.
-Get up, Hound! -[Hound] I can't go on.
But you gotta keep fighting!
Tank's empty, bro.
There's more of 'em coming. If you don't get up and fight, we're going to die. Let's go!
and fight, we're going to die. Let's go!
Attack!
[Hound] Optimus is here!
[Optimus] Bee, jump!
I hate cheap knockoffs.
[Joshua] Awesome job!
-You. -Who?
-You. -[Optimus] Step forward.
Wait. Why?
Your science will be responsible for humanity's extinction.
All right. I know that you're sensitive
All right. I know that you're sensitive to this whole bioethical dilemma.
Maybe all he wants to hear you say is that some things should never be invented.
Okay.
We'll lead you out of the city.
Get that Seed safely to the hills.
[Drift] Use this car.
[Joshua] He almost ate me!
All right, we're good!
All right, let's go!
[Shane] Get out of that seat.
And you're one lucky dad to have me.
Okay, Lucky Charms. You got that. You drive. Let's go.
-What did you do? -[device beeping]
I don't know. I don't know, but it's an issue.
-Did you press a button? -Is it gonna blow up?
I don't know.
Your thing is beeping now, so you must have hit something.
-Is it gonna blow up? -I don't know!
A bomb starts beeping, that might signal a problem, you think?
I'm just saying that it's a steady blinking light,
which could be a timer of some kind.
Unless it's signaling location.
To who?
We've got to call the central government for help!
[Lockdown] Optimus Prime.
Come to me.
There's the bridge.
[all] Back it up! Back it up! Go, go, go, go! Back up! Go back! Go back!
[Shane] Move! Get out of the way. I can't see!
-Shane, drive faster! -Okay, just calm down.
-[Tessa] Shane, watch out! -Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Get cover! -Back up! Back! Back up!
Autobots, fall back!
-Come on, move! Out of my way! -Get out of the way!
-Come on, move! Out of my way! -Get out of the way! -Look out! -Just hit them! Just hit them!
It's a big magnet!
It's sucking up metal and dropping it!
[Joshua] Oh!
-Go faster! Go faster! -[Shane] Move! -Get out of the way! -It's coming! It's coming!
-Get out of the way! -It's coming! It's coming!
It's coming closer!
Go faster, Shane!
Watch out, watch out! -Watch out! -[Joshua] Look out!
Oh, no, now it's circling back towards us! Hard right! Take a hard right!
Oh, my God!
Oh, no. No, the magnet. Get out, get out! Come on! Come here! Get out!
[Joshua] No, no, no! No, we're going up. Grab the bomb!
Help me grab the bomb! [Shane] I can't get the seat belt off!
[Joshua] Pull me down! Catch me!
I'm going up! I'm going up!
Get me! Grab me!
Pull me down! Pull me!
[Shane] I can't get the seat belt off! I can't get the belt off!
I'm stuck! I'm stuck!
[Cade] Hold the bomb! I can't hold on!
-[grunting] -Pull!
Guys, it's crushing me!
Move!
-Shane! -I'm good! I'm good.
Bumblebee!
[Bumblebee] Hey, you guys!
Come on.
Go find someplace safe.
I'm proud of you.
Get cover!
Cade!
Autobots, get this bomb over the bridge and out of the city!
Dad!
What? Come on.
I got it! I'm getting this bomb out of here!
Give me the gun.
It's you and me now!
Look, Optimus is out there all alone.
What? You can't help him.
I have to, Tess. He came back for us.
Dad, don't leave, please.
Look, I'll find you, I'll get there, okay?
Dad, no, you'll die!
You gotta stay with Shane. You're gonna be okay.
You promise me you're gonna keep her safe,
rest of her life, until the end of time! Promise me!
I promise you.
You're the best thing I ever made, Tess.
All right, don't ever forget it, it was always you.
-I love you. -Please.
Get in the car, now.
[Tessa] Dad!
Prime!
-[Tessa] Stop the car! -[tires screech]
-[Bumblebee] You better listen. -No, you listen.
I'm not leaving my dad.
[Crosshairs] All right, we're gonna hold the line,
then block the bridge!
You see, it takes patience to make a man.
The patience to watch and wait, to protect all of us, quietly,
for God and country, without any recognition at all!
Cade!
There are no good aliens! Or bad aliens, Yeager.
It's just us and them.
And you chose them.
Anytime.
You saved the human instead of saving yourself?
You bring shame upon us all.
She never listens. Never.
[Optimus] I gave you an order!
Get out of here, now!
Get in. Get in.
Hey, you! Hey!
Cade, get out of here! This is my fight!
It's my fight,
and you're all gonna die!
Go! Go!
Come on! Come on!
Yeah! Killer robot, my ass!
Come on.
Get away, all of you!
Come on, Tess. Come on, Tess. Come on, Tess.
Drive!
-You see my face, your life is done! -Oh!
Come on, come on, come on!
Honor to the end.
You still happy we met?
Always.
[Optimus] Hurry!
Quickly! I'm setting off Lockdown's grenade! Hold tight!
We shall meet again, Prime,
for I am reborn.
Kind of nice being your hero for a change.
[softly] You always were. All my life.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Let's go home to graduation, huh?
[Cade] You're okay, kid.
Come here, you're all right. You're all right.
We don't have a home, Dad. It blew up.
I might be able to help you with that.
[Optimus] Brave warriors...
...you are free!
[Crosshairs] I'll ride with you anytime, Spike!
Did you miss me?
No.
This Seed belongs to our creators,
whoever they are.
There remains a price on my head.
I endanger you all if I stay.
I shall take it where it can never be found.
Will we ever see you again?
[Optimus] Cade Yeager,
I do not know.
But whenever you look to the stars,
think of one of them
as my soul.
Defend this family, Autobots,
as they have you.
Defend
all they can be.
[Optimus] There are mysteries to the universe we were never meant to solve.
But who we are and why we are here
are not among them.
Those answers
we carry inside.
I am Optimus Prime
and this message is to my creators.
Leave planet Earth alone.

Yeah, I know, Dad. See you Friday.
You gotta say "I love you" back. Dad, are you serious?
I wanna hear it. "I love you, Dad." You wanna hear me say it?
You're dropping me off at a school.
"I love you, Dad." Look at this place. "Dad, I love you."
Dad, I love you.
That's a copy.

Hey, good morning. How you doin'?
Weekend was short, huh? BOY 2: "That's a copy."

Wait. Why is the voice in my head so loud?
What?
Oh! Are you okay? What?
[THINKING] Why am I so sweaty?
Why are you so sweaty?
It's a puberty thing.
I don't know why I said that. I'm not going through puberty.
I did, but I'm done.

Yeah. That's one thing.
Cool. Yeah. I'm Miles.

Yes, it's African. I'm South African.
No accent though 'cause I was raised here.

Why is this so scary?
Am I doing this in slow motion or does it just feel that way?
I'm kidding. It's Wanda. No "G." That's crazy. Heh.
[DEEPLY] Hey.
Okay, then.

I can't let go. Ow! Ow! Calm down. It's fine.

I promise.
Go. Destroy the collider.
I'll come and find you.

Nice. Aw, that's a no-no. [KINGPIN CHUCKLES]
PETER: This might open a black hole under Brooklyn.
It can't be worth the risk.
It's not always about the money, Spider-Man.

Wait.

and it won't work.
They're gone.

Miles. It's a weeknight. You made a commitment to that school.
He's upset.
[SIGHS] Of course you can stay.
Dad? Yeah.
Do you really hate Spider-Man?
Yeah. I mean, with a vigilante, there is--
Jeff, mi amor.
What? He asked me.
Baby, you know how I feel about Spider-Man. Come on.
Tú sabes que él te quiere mucho.
That's why he's tough on you. You know that, right?
Mom, do you ever think about moving out of Brooklyn?

Yeah, I know.

MARY JANE: My husband, Peter Parker,

He always said it could've been anyone behind the mask.
He was just the kid who happened to get bit.
I'm going to miss him.
Yeah.

Can I return it if it doesn't fit?
It always fits

I think I really messed it up.
I wanna do what you asked.
I really do.
But I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I'm the guy.
I can't do this without you.
[GASPS] Hey, kid.
What did I do to him?!
No.
Who are you?
PETER 2: All right, people, let's do this one last time.
My name is Peter B. Parker.
I was bitten by a radioactive spider. And for the last 22 years,
I thought I was the one and only Spider-Man.
What a day.
I'm pretty sure you know the rest.
You see, I saved the city, fell in love, I got married,
saved the city some more, maybe too much.
My marriage got testy, made some dicey money choices.
Don't invest in a spider-themed restaurant.
Then like 15 years passed. Blah, blah, blah. Super boring.
I broke my back, a drone flew into my face,
I buried Aunt May. My wife and I split up.
But I handled it like a champion.
[CRYING] 'Cause, you know what, no matter how many times I get hit,
I always get back up. [ALARM CHIMING AND BUZZING]
And I got a lot of time to reflect and work on myself.
Did you know that seahorses, that they mate for life?
Could you imagine?
A seahorse seeing another seahorse
and then making it work?
She wanted kids and... And it scared me.
And it scared me.
I'm pretty sure I broke her heart.
Flash-forward: I'm in my apartment doing push-ups,
doing ab crunches, getting strong,
when this weird thing happened.
And I gotta say, weird things happen to me a lot.
But this was real weird.
You see, I was in New York, but things were different.
Also, I was dead.
And blond.
I was kind of perfect.
It was like looking in a mirror.
I have a feeling that the thing that brought me here was the thing that got him killed.
You wanna know what happened next?
Me, too.
MILES: Who are you?
OFFICER 1: What are you doin' over there?
Freeze! P.D.N.Y.
Are you kidding me right now?
OFFICER 2: Stop! Stop!
I gotcha. I gotcha.
OFFICER 1: Hey, kid. Drop the body.
Hey, kid. Get over here! OFFICER 2: Come on, now! MILES: Whoa.
See you, officers!
Aw, come on.
OFFICER 1: Hey, kid. OFFICER 2: Kid, come on, now!
Put 'em up, son!
Uh... adiós?
Help! Somebody stop that train!
PETER 2: Oh, hey. What the--?
Sorry.
I'm gonna die!
OFFICER [OVER RADIO]: Looks like a child dressed like Spider-Man dragging a homeless corpse behind a train.
Yes! I didn't kill you.
PETER 2: Who are you? MILES: Who are you?
PETER 2: Why are you trying to kill me? I'm not. I'm trying to save you.
MILES: Hey, maybe you guys can go around? [BARKS] All right. Thanks, New York.
[BARKS] All right. Thanks, New York.
PETER 2: What was that?
Kid electrocuted me
with his hands.
You're like me. I got some questions.
Why do you look like Peter Parker?
Because I am Peter Parker.
Then why aren't you dead? And why is your hair different?
Why are you older? And why is your body
a different shape?
Pretty sure you just called me fat.
You don't look so hot either, kid. Most superheroes don't wear their own merch.
Are you a ghost? No.
Are you a zombie? Stop it.
Am I a zombie? You're not even close.
Are you from another dimension? Like a parallel universe
Are you from another dimension? Like a parallel universe where things are like this universe but different?
And you're Spider-Man in that universe?
But somehow traveled to this universe, but you don't know how?
Wow. That was really just a guess? We learned about it in physics.
Quantum theory. This is amazing!
You can teach me like Peter said he would. Before he died.
Yeah. Exactly. Yeah, right.
Look, I made a promise to him.
Here's lesson number one, kid.
Don't watch the mouth. Watch the hands.
Peter, seriously--
[SIGHS] Trust me, kid. This'll all make you a better Spider-Man.
Hey, are you okay? PETER 2: No, I'm not.
What's going on with your body?
I don't think my atoms are real jazzed about being in the wrong dimension.
Look, I'm not looking for a side gig as a Spider-Man coach.
I got a lot going on in my dimension.
"With great power comes great--"
Don't you dare finish that sentence. Don't do it! I'm sick of it.
Want my advice? Go back to being a regular kid.
I don't have a choice! Kingpin's got a supercollider.
He's tryin' to kill me.
What did you just say? Kingpin's tryin' to kill me.
Who cares about that. Where's the collider? Brooklyn. Under Fisk Tower.
Goodbye. Where you going?
When it runs again, I'll jump in and get back to my life. You can't let them run it.
I'm supposed to destroy it so it never runs again or everyone's gonna die.
"Or everyone's gonna die." That is what they always say.
But there's always a little bit of time before everybody dies
and that's when I do my best work.
Aren't you gonna need this?
Aw, you have a goober. Give it.
Wait, no. Not so fast. He called it an override key.
There's always a bypass key, a virus key, a who-cares key.
I can never remember, so I always call it a goober. Give it.
I need it to destroy the collider. I need it to go home.
I'll swallow it. Don't play with me.
What? I said--
The collider created a portal that brought me here. And I have to get--
Did you break this? No, it broke.
I don't remember what happened.
See, this is why I never had kids. Can't we make another one?
Can't we make another one? We can't do anything. Thanks to you,
I have to re-steal what your guy stole from Alchemax
and make another one of these. [GRUNTS]
If I don't turn off the collider after you leave,
everyone in this city, my parents, my uncle and millions of others, will die.
And you're just gonna go home and leave me here to figure this out for myself?
You good with that, Spider-Man? Yeah.
What are you doing?
Making you feel guilty. Is it working?
How could it--? No. Look at me. Does it look like it's working?
No. No, it's not-- [SIGHS, CHUCKLES]
No! No! No! Do not let him win!
All right, kid. You win. Come on, we don't have a second to lose.
Mmm. I love this burger. So delicious.
One of the best burgers I've ever had.
In my universe, this place closed six years ago.
I don't know why. I really don't. Mmm.
You have money, right? I'm not very liquid right now.
Can we focus? Mm-hm. Sure.
The other Peter-- You gonna eat that?
I'm listening.
The other Peter said he was gonna be showing me the ropes. Wow.
MILES: You got any Spider-Man tips you can tell me now?
Yeah, I got plenty.
Disinfect the mask.
You're gonna wanna use baby powder in the suit, heavy on the joints.
You don't want any chafing, right?
Anything else? Nope, that was everything.
I think you're gonna be a bad teacher.
Uh-uh-uh? Look up where Alchemax is.
"A private technological campus in Hudson Valley, New York."
[GASPS] You can teach me to swing on the way there.
I'm not swinging to the Hudson Valley, Miles. Not after a hearty burger breakfast.
Keep your legs fresh. You're gonna thank me later.
And it's a no on the cape. I think it's cool.
Take that off. It's disrespectful. Spider-Man doesn't wear a cape. [GROANS]
MILES: So how do we retrace Peter's steps? That's a good question.
What would I do if I were me?
Got it.
Step One: I infiltrate the lab.
Two: Find the head scientist's computer.
MILES: That lady with the bike is the head scientist. I saw her in this documentary.
PETER 2: Cool! Step Three: I reexamine my personal biases.
Step Four: I hack the computer.
It's not technically hacking.
Not now. I just lost my train of thought.
Step Five: Download the important stuff. I'll know it when I see it.
Step Six: I grab a bagel from the cafeteria and run.
So, what am I doing?
Step Seven: You stay here. You're lookout. Very important.
Look, man. You gotta teach me how to do Spider-Man stuff or I won't be able to help.
Watch and learn, kid! I'll quiz ya later!
Why did I get stuck with the janky, old, broke hobo Spider-Man?!
That's new.
Kingpin.
What am I doing? What am I doing? What am I doing? What am I doing?
Peter!
Peter!
[YELPS] Peter!
What are you doing here? Kingpin's here.
Just move over. You're steppin' on my foot. Go back outside.
No! I can't sit there and let Spider-Man die without doing anything about it.
I'm not doing that again.
What?
Most people I meet in the workplace try to kill me,
so you're a nice change of pace.
Mr. Fisk! Look at this data.
I know you can't really understand it, but these are really good numbers.
And I got the password.
Mr. Fisk. If we fire again this week
there could be a black hole under Brooklyn.
You see this? And this?
This is multiple dimensions beginning to crash into each other.
This is pretty standard Spider-Man stakes. You get used to it. Watch this.
You get used to it. Watch this. He's gonna say, "You've got 24 hours."
You've got 24 hours.
What this means is there could be a rupture in the space-time continuum.
Ooh. That's bad. Actually, everything she said was bad. I was lying before.
SCIENTIST: Hold on. Let me get you some more data.
What are you doing, bud? I can't move.
Okay, relax your fingers. We don't have time. Just let go. Be in the moment.
I am in the moment. It's a terrible moment.
I'm not refusing. No more excuses.
I just need more time.
They're right there. They're gonna see you.
Miles, you gotta unstick.
What do you do to relax?
Relax. Okay, okay, okay.

Do you know how painful that would be, Peter Parker?
I don't know.
You can't imagine.
And I, for one,
can't wait to watch.
What did you say your name was?
Dr. Olivia Octavius.
Can I assume that your friends call you Doc Ock?
My friends actually call me Liv.
My enemies call me Doc Ock.
I got this! Run!
OLIVIA: Who are you talking to?
I got it! Oh, you "got it," Peter?
I got it handled, buddy!
Everything is fine!
PETER 2: Okay, this is
a little bit bad. OLIVIA: You're chatty.
Gotta go.
This is the moment that I'm losin' the fight.
Let me tell you the good news. We don't need the monitor.
[GRUNTS] OLIVIA: Peter!
You didn't tell me you had an invisible friend!
Could you give me that back, young man? Peter!
It's proprietary.
This'd be a good time to turn invisible. Yep.
Okay, not gonna turn invisible. Selecting a bagel.
Act super normal.
Spider-Man?
You know, that's funny, I get that a lot. Hey.
Spider-Man? Hey! Hands up!
Now we do a switchy-switchy.
WOMAN: Get back here! Where do you think you're going?
He took a bagel! Time to swing,
He took a bagel! Time to swing, just like I taught ya. When did you teach me that?
I didn't. It's a little joke for team-building.
Hey!
All right, you ready? Of course I'm not ready!
I can't do this yet!
Everybody knows that the best way to learn is under intense life-threatening pressure.
Come on, come on, come on.
Uh-oh.
PETER 2: What are you doing down there?
I run better than I swing.
You gotta swing or they'll catch you.
This is what you wanted.
Uh-oh.
OLIVIA: Come back, little boy.
Aim with your hips! Look where you want it to hit.
Square your shoulders. Don't forget to follow through!
Don't shoot off your back foot.
That's too many things! Then stop listening to me!
That's the best idea you've had all day!
PETER 2: Nice, Miles!
[MILES LAUGHS] Good. You're doin' it.
Double tap to release and thwip it out again.
Thwip and release.
And thwip. Release. Thwip. And release.
You're a natural. Thwip. Release.
Feel the rhythm? Thwip. And release!
Good, Miles. I gotta say, you're amazing, man.
We're a little team!
Me as the teacher who could still do it.
You as the student who can do it, just not as good.
I'm proud of us. Is there something you want to say to me?
Peter!
What the--? PETER 2: Who did that?
Hey, guys.
Gwanda?
It's Gwen, actually.
Oh, you know her. Very cool.
I'm from another dimension.
I mean, another-another dimension.
GWEN: All right, people. Let's start at the beginning one last time.
My name is Gwen Stacy. I was bitten by a radioactive spider.
And for the last two years, I've been the one and only Spider-Woman.
You guys know the rest.
I joined a band.
Saved my dad.
I couldn't save my best friend,
Peter Parker,
so now I save everyone else.
And I don't do friends anymore,
just to avoid any distractions.
And one day this weird thing happened.
And I mean, like, really weird.
I was blown into last week.
Literally.
I landed in New York, but not my New York.
REPORTER: Lucky for these folks, Spider-Man was there to save the day.
My Spider-sense told me to head to Visions Academy.
--you guys are early.
Wasn't sure why until I met you. Oh!
I like your haircut.
You don't get to like my haircut.
Let's go.
How many more Spider-People are there? Save it for Comic-Con.
What's Comic-Con? Whoa!
KINGPIN: You're dead, Spider-Man.
Wilson! What are you doing?
Vanessa.
Richard, come on.
Vanessa! Richard!
No!
Don't look back, honey. It's okay. It's okay.
I killed Spider-Man.
Why did I just see two more?
There's three, actually.
No, this is good. This is very, very good.
This means you get what you want.
It means my collider works.
All we have to do is kill a couple of Spiders.
And the collider will bring your family back.
As many families as you want.
Tomorrow, at my collider.
Our collider.
He broke this?
Yeah. He's actually really embarrassed about it, [WHISPERS] so just keep it between us, okay?
I know where we can make a new one. And we won't let him break it this time.
I'm sorry about your friend.
Thanks, Miles.
I know how hard this is. To have to figure this stuff out on your own.
It's kinda nice not being the only Spider-person around.
Yeah.
If you ever decide to do friends again, I could always open up a slot.
I'll keep you posted.
MILES: Cool.
We should probably go.
GWEN: Peter, we're literally on the doorstep.
GWEN: Peter, we're literally on the doorstep. PETER 2: Bad idea. This is a bad idea.
PETER 2: Bad idea. This is a bad idea. GWEN: Just relax. [PETER 2 GRUNTS]
WOMAN: You guys are all very sweet, but no more fans today, please.
I'm not ready for this.
Peter?
Hey, Aunt May.
So this is gonna sound crazy, but I'm pretty sure that I'm from an--
An alternate dimension.
Yeah.
You look tired, Peter.
Well, I am tired.
And older. And thicker. Yeah. I've heard that already.
Oh, jeez. Are those sweatpants?
Yup, that's what they are.
I was there,
when it all happened.
I am so sorry.
And what dimension are you from?
Brooklyn.
Did Peter have a place where we could make another one of these?
MAY: A goober.
Follow me.
PETER 2: Oh, yeah, I got one of these, too.
A little, old shed where I keep my Spider-gear.
I mean, this place is pretentious.
Whoa.
Dude. Was yours anything like this?
Mine was like this, but take away the jeep, the plane.
Imagine it way smaller. Imagine a futon.
I feel sad for this guy.
[WHISPERS] Hey, Peter.
I think this is a cape.
Peter knew how dangerous the job was.
But he figured the only one who could stop this guy was Spider-Man.
Kingpin knows we're coming.
We're going to be outnumbered.
Don't be so sure.
You might need these.
You think you're the only people who thought to come here?
Hey, fellas.
Is he in black and white?
Where's that wind coming from? We're in a basement.
Wherever I go, the wind follows.
And the wind, it smells like rain.
Hi, guys!
This could literally not get any weirder.
It can get weirder.
I just washed my hands. That's why they're wet.
No other reason.
ALL: You're like me.
PETER NOIR: My name is Peter Parker.
PENI: My name is Peni Parker.
PORKER: My name is Peter Porker.
PETER NOIR & PENI: I was bitten by a radioactive spider. PORKER: I was bitten by a radioactive pig.
PETER NOIR: In my universe, it's 1933, and I'm a private eye.
I like to drink egg creams, and I like to fight Nazis. A lot.
PENI: I'm from New York in the year 3145.
I have a psychic link with a spider who lives inside my father's robot.
And we're best friends. Forever.
PETER NOIR: Sometimes I let matches burn down to my fingertips just to feel something, anything.
PORKER: I'm a photographer for the Daily Beagle.
When I'm not pooching around, I'm working like a dog, trying to sniff out the latest story.
♪ I frolic and I dance ♪ ♪ And I do this With my pants ♪
Okay! Enough!
So how did you get here?
Well, it's kind of a long story.
Maybe not that long.
And now we're just trying to find a way home.
The only way home is back through that collider gizmo. The only trouble is--
One of us has to stay behind and destroy it.
I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.
No, no, no. You guys don't get it.
Don't get what?
None of you can stay here. If you stay here, you'll die.
I'm the guy who's gonna turn it off.
And I'm gonna get you all home before I do.
Look, I made a promise. So I have to keep it.
Who are you again?
This is Miles. And he's gonna save the multiverse. Yeah, man.
Yeah, man. This kid can turn himself invisible. Watch this. He can do it now.
I can't do it on command. He can't do it on command.
But it is cool. Show 'em the zappy thing, Miles.
Can't do it on command. He can't do it on command.
But he can do so much more. What else do you do?
Just those two things. Just those two things.
Aw, man.
Look, I've seen him in action. He's got potential.
I think he's gonna get us home.
Okay, little fella, Kingpin's gonna send a lot of mugs after ya.
I'm talkin' hard boys, real biscuit boxers. Can you fight them all off at once?
I haven't actually fought anyone. Surprise attack!
Can you rewire a mainframe while being shot at?
Can I what? Show me!
Surprise attack! [GRUNTS]
Can you swing and flip with the grace of a trained dancer?
Can you close off your feelings so you don't get crippled by the moral ambiguity of your violent actions?
Can you help your aunt create an online dating profile
so she can get out of the dang house once in a while?
Can you float through the air when you smell a delicious pie?
Can you be strong? Ruthless?
Disciplined? I don't know. Maybe. Psychic? Show me some moxie, soldier!
Psychic? Show me some moxie, soldier!
Above all, no matter how many times you get hit,
can you get back up? [EXCLAIMS]
'Cause when a Spider-Man is on the floor...
When you think you can't keep goin'...
Come on, Miles. Come on. You can do it. You can do this. Guys, cool it.
You can do this. Guys, cool it.
Come on. You can do it! Get up, Miles.
Come on, Miles. Get up.
You need to be more honest with yourself about this.
He's not ready. It's obvious. There's no way. He's just a kid.
GWEN: If he can't do this, we have to stay and do it for him.
He's looking right at us while we talk about him.
Miles?
Miles?
You see that? He can, um...
He can turn invisible.

He has a soft spot for you,

Hope you're good.
MILES: Dear Uncle Aaron.
I gotta do something, and I don't know if I can do it.
I'm scared, man.
I'm just tired of lettin' everybody down.
You're the only one I can talk to.
I just wish you were here. [FIRE ESCAPE CLANKS]

I've got the security tapes from the tunnel right here.

This is... Purple. No.
Purple. No.
Blue? No.

He's got what it takes.
I bet you he's gonna come back through that door, recharged and ready to fight.
My uncle. Hey, where have you been?
My uncle Aaron, he's the Prowler.
Slow down, Miles. He works for Kingpin. He tried to kill me!
PETER NOIR: This is a pretty hard-core origin story.
It's okay. We're gonna figure it out.
Were you followed? No, I don't think so.
Cute place. Real homey. Oh, great. It's Liv.
I guess I was followed. Oh, no.
Get out of here, kid.
You messed up bigtime, kid. Very sloppy.
Let me guess. You're Scorpion. Well, we're the Spider gang.

We don't pick the ballroom, we just dance.
Ooh, I think I'll be taking that.

No, Miles.

Hey, sideburns, tell us about the gold.
Look, we're all friends here.
Let's help each other out.
You don't wanna get popped, and I don't wanna pop you. [ Chuckles ] Oh, you don't?
[ Coughs ] No. So you're just gonna give us that case,
[ Coughs ] No. So you're just gonna give us that case, you're gonna start talking, and then you get to keep roaming around,
you're gonna start talking, and then you get to keep roaming around, with your bitchin' ginger sideburns.
You know what?
I'm sick of hiding.
Thank you. I thank you very much.
That's better! Oh!
Hell, yeah! Let's do this!
[ Roy ] Contain!
[ Roy ] Contain!
Didn't contain!
Suck it!
- Ow! - Straight butt!
- Come on! - It's rodeo time!
Pappy's got some ropin' to do!
How about a little help?
[ Groans ] Okay.
Are you okay? Somebody call 911!
I'm okay. Nothing to see.
Gotta go!
The head! Aim for the head!
I'm still here, you son of a bitch! - Hey-yaa! - Yee-haw-haw!
Ow! My ass!
[ Man ] What is that?
Whoo-hoo! Coming through!
[ People Screaming ] Excuse me. Pardon me. - Yee-haw! - [ Grunts ]
Here I come!
Relax body.
[ Roy ] Rook!
[ Sirens Wailing In Distance ] Over here!
If it's not too much trouble.
[ Woman Yelps ] Thank you very much.
I've never seen one like that before.
Never! Never before has this happened! All right.
Congratulations, guys, on your unprecedented cock-up! All right!
on your unprecedented cock-up! All right!
You let an exposed deado loose on the streets in the middle of the day.
You were supposed to contain. That is your most basic job. There's no containing that thing.
That is your most basic job. There's no containing that thing. You failed spectacularly. He's right, sweetie pie. It was different.
You failed spectacularly. He's right, sweetie pie. It was different.
We have evidence-- You don't investigate. You don't get creative.
We have evidence-- You don't investigate. You don't get creative. You do as you're told. When you don't, this happens.
You do as you're told. When you don't, this happens.
...terrifying.
Whatever rampaged through the streets of Boston today was not human.
Now look where we are. You get to deal with them.
Who in this endless stream of freaks is "them"?
Eternal Affairs. Hammer's droppin'.
Well?
They're pissed, justifiably.
However, apparently, you stumbled upon something important.
[ Chuckles ] Don't act so surprised, honey pot.
"The gold that Officers Pulsipher and Walker brought in...
are part of an incredibly dangerous artifact known as the Staff of Jericho."
Oh, crap.
Maybe feather it in for the new guy, a little bit.
Remember the tunnel we pulled you out of when you died?
That's the only way to get to the afterlife. It's a one-way street.
This artifact, if built, reverses the tunnel.
The dead rain down on the Earth. That's it for the living world.
Yeah, massive destruction.
We broke it to pieces 3,000 years ago. Now it's back.
Till we get the rest of the gold, we're on red alert.
Also, apparently, you need "the blood of thine enemy."
- There are more diagrams. - Why--
Why-Why would someone make something like that?
Come on!
Here I am, willing the streets into order,
making headway year after dominant year!
And now everything I've done is being threatened...
because of some ancient totem forged for kicks...
by some asshole 5,000 years ago?
Why even try? I mean, how am I supposed to do it?
Look at you-- so proud of yourself.
"I got an important tube."
What?
Well, what is it?
Actually, it looks like you two...
Actually, it looks like you two... don't need to concern yourselves with the red alert.
It brings me no pleasure to inform you...
It brings me no pleasure to inform you... that because of your recent epic failure, you've both been suspended.
that because of your recent epic failure, you've both been suspended. - You're off the case. - Whoa, whoa. Hold on a sec.
- You're off the case. - Whoa, whoa. Hold on a sec.
What? We are the case. We're the ones who brought it in!
The feeling is that luck was involved.
There'll be a formal hearing tomorrow, after which you'll most likely be erased.
Erased?
So in this moment of crisis, they're gonna suspend...
and then erase their best officer...
and this other guy.
Better officers are taking over.
No such thing. Name one.
- Jacobson, DuBow, Waterson. - Come on.
- Carson. Jackson. - He's pretty good.
That guy who works at the taco cart.
Shall I go on? Okay, okay!
So tomorrow is my last day?
Most likely. I'm sorry.
Well, shit.
Miss Proctor, it's been a delight.
Roy, thank you very much for your mentorship.
I'm sure it meant a lot to you.
I got somewhere more important to be.
Who are you?
Why are you following me, huh?
Stay away from me.
I haven't left you.
It's me.
No.
So. Congratulations.
So. Congratulations. You finally did it.
You get what you wanted?
I might get erased tomorrow. What do you think I'm gonna do?
You're freaking her out, if you haven't noticed.
I'm not from a time of sensitivities and emotionalism.
And, yes, in my day, I bought my love by the hour.
But I do know that what you are doing is not helping.
It's called haunting, hoss. You're causing her pain.
Why do you think we're here, why we do what we do?
It's so that Julia can have a world to live in.
And, yeah, that means without you.
She needs to survive you, meet someone new, maybe have a family.
Because you are not coming back, ever.
The job is all you have now.
We don't have the job anymore.
Nick, resolve your crap.
Nick, resolve your crap. Do like me. Like you?
Yes, emulate my peace.
Your Zen-like calm?
Hey, it's taken me a very long time to achieve this state.
You could get there, too, but for your weakness.
Oh, you know what? I've had it.
I can't listen to one more self-righteous chestnut outta your mouth.
I don't want to live in your weird past with you.
Speaking of which, those coyotes-- You be careful now.
Those coyotes who ate your bones and crapped out your face--
in that story, the coyotes are the heroes.
Hey, you may think the Old West was all shits and giggles...
and sarsaparilla and two-cent whores.
It wasn't!
It was smelly. It was violent.
It was ridden with dysentery and no-account Injuns.
I've had a lot of anger to get past, okay?
And you-- you, Nick-- are bringing a lot of shit out...
that I've been suppressing for a very long time.
One of them coyotes, he made love to my skull.
You know what that practice is commonly called?
I do.
And I certainly hope he got both eyes, Roy.
[ Roy ] ♪ Words, like daggers ♪ ♪ Stab our heart, boys ♪
♪ Stab our heart, boys ♪
♪ Gotta be the better man ♪
- Song's called "Better Man." - Yeah, I got that.
♪ People, they can break your heart, boys ♪
♪ Like no coyote ever can ♪♪
Maybe I took things a little too far.
Maybe?
I'm sorry.
You ought to take up an instrument, Nick.
Might be a tuneful way for you... to spend what may be your last moments.
You were right about the job, Roy.
We gotta get back out there.
Suspendato.
They want me back, they're gonna have to beg.
I'm not gonna take this lying down. You?
You gonna sit there and mope?
Or do you want to help me stop a-- you know, an apocalypse?
You put it that way, hell, you-- you kind of paint me into a corner.
I know Hayes is sitting on some of that gold.
There's no way he's just a bagman.
Let me ask you something.
Did he like Indian food?
He's not a fan. But something's bugging me.
I rode with this guy for five years. I never noticed any kind of... "soul stank."
I never noticed any kind of... "soul stank."
I heard talk of a rare kind of artifact that could mask it--
like a spiritual deodorant.
Be something he carried with him all the time.
Like Grandma's St. Christopher medal.
That'd do her.
Let's go pop the son of a bitch.
You know what to do?
Oh, yeah. Been waiting a long time for this.
You've been waiting a long time?
Do you know how many years deados have been trying to pull this off? 3,000.
Not one of those jag-offs could get all that gold together.
Until me. [ Chuckles ]
R.I.P.D.'s not gonna know what hit 'em.
Now go find yourself some trouble.
My pleasure.
- [ Phone Line Rings ] - [ Hayes ] Hey, Julia.
Hey, I need to talk to you.
Something really strange happened to me.
What's going on?
I was at the track last night. Do you remember that guy at the funeral--
the little Chinese guy, the one who was yelling?
All right, slow down, slow down. Take a deep breath.
I don't know, somehow I feel like it's Nick who's trying to talk to me.
Okay.
I know it sounds crazy. It's--
I know you miss him. I miss him too.
I don't think you should be alone right now.
I'm gonna come pick you up, and I'm gonna take you to lunch,
and we can talk about everything.
All right?
Okay.
All right. Thank you for this.
Absolutely. I'll see you later.
Take the front. I'll go around back.
Works for me.
Bobby Hayes?
Yeah.
I need to ask you a few questions involving a tandoori clay oven.
[ Chuckles ] Sweetheart, you can ask me anything you want.
Make yourself comfortable.
How about a little drinky-poo?
Sure. I'll wet my beak.
Coming right up.
You looking for this?
Nice move, Nick.
Hey, tough look to pull off.
I'm getting used to it. [ Chuckling ]
- You know, it was just business. - Make a move. Please.
[ Roy ] Easy, Nick.
"It's late on Ash Wednesday"--
We can skip that part, Roy.
Take off the St. Christopher's medal... now.
Okay.
Powerful stank.
Where's the gold, dead man?
Check the water heater.
Oh. Freakin' super cop here.
[ Roy ] All right, saddle up.
We're gonna ride you in.
I know it's wrong, but the whole cowboy-talk thing,
I know it's wrong, but the whole cowboy-talk thing, it's kind of working for me.
What you got to smile about?
Hey, how do you like working with this guy?
Hangs on a little tight to stuff, huh?
What we got together is none of your damn business.
Where's the rest of the gold, Hayes?
See what I mean? Won't let it die.
Hey, Nick, remember when I got shot, got that medal?
Hey, Nick, remember when I got shot, got that medal? You couldn't believe I pulled through.
Wild guess-- you didn't pull through.
Get killed by some junkie and go to hell...
because I took a little on the side to pay for lap dances?
No. I don't think so.
Who gets to make that call? I don't accept it.
Let me ask you something. What do you think eternal punishment's gonna be like?
Hell can kiss my ass. I'm staying right here.
Lap dancing.
[ Policeman ] That's a nice look you got. That's nice with the face and the hair.
All right, sit down. [ Mutters ]
Hey, you might want to book that gold... before your partner gets his hands on it.
What's this? That's personal.
Then it gets booked--
along with this gold that I brought in.
That's right, doll face, despite my chickenshit suspension.
I'm available for, like, a tutorial-type thing... if you or the guys want a few tips.
Maybe get yourselves up near my level.
Why did I have to love you?
We had a beautiful moment in time. Catastrophic mistake.
Run it down, but you felt what you felt.
Take a seat. This is good.
It's gonna help me get over "the shot in the face" thing.
Whatever's waiting for you on the other side is gonna be bad.
Don't worry. It's only forever.
Stash this gold with the rest of it. And here.
Hey, we just booked something just like this.
Yeah, it's in the basket over there.
Gonna need to fill out another form.
I'd love to. Got nothing else better to do.
Well, there's one decent thing about being a deado, right?
We can't hear certain frequencies so well.
Roy!
Come on, Nicky. You thought I'd just let you bring me here...
Come on, Nicky. You thought I'd just let you bring me here... if I didn't want to be here all along?
Isn't this thing sweet?
Freezes you guys up, does nothing to us.
They got one of these artifacts for everything.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Go! Go, go, go! Come on!
Get the gold! Take everything!
- It's all there? - Uh-huh.
Catch!
Fill up all these hands. Come on! Got it.
Let's go! Let's go!
What's up?
Peace.
[ Deado ] Flush it!
No! The gold!
Here, boss! I got it all.
I'm on it! [ Beeps ]
Daddy's got gold!
Let's build it, boys!
Damn it! It's jammed up!
Just like Main Street, Dodge City.
Them dudes, they picked the wrong venue to make a stand.
I invented this shit.
[ Grunting ] Hot!
Fixed it! Yeah! Yeah! [ Exhales ]
Go time!
Let's learn you a few things about Old West fighting.
First--
only a novice hides in a church steeple.
It's the first place I'm gonna look.
Second place-- hotel window. Every time.
I guess there's only one novice in their crew.
Sometimes the window guy is on the roof.
Haven't seen that before.
Must be the massive destruction Proctor was talking about.
Saddle up!
Hey, Julia. Hayes sent us to give you a lift.
Guys, I can still drive.
It's pretty hairy out there.
He's just worried about you.
Close it up.
All right, lock it up!
Nobody gets through to the Commonwealth Building!
Nobody! [ Grunts ]
Looks like the big one's right over the Commonwealth Building.
That's where he'll be headed.
Yeah. Good read.
You agreeing with me-- that's-that's weird.
Yeah. Feels strange.
Kind of tingly.
Deados on wheels.
Oh, that's disappointing.
I was hoping to get a little break here.
Make it go away, Nick!
I got it.
Holy shit!
That actually scared the shit out of me.
Get the gold up top. I gotta wait for the final piece.
Hey, you okay? What the hell is going on?
Lots going on! I'm glad you're here with me.
We need to get inside. Listen. There's something I should tell you.
It's something I've been hiding. Bobby, I think it can wait.
What the hell are you-- And it might seem a little weird.
But I think you should just try to keep an open mind...
and not judge right away, okay?
[ Female Anchor ] Skycam 4 is on the scene with continuing coverage.
We are looking down on the Commonwealth Building,
which is swarming with-- there's really no other way to say this-- monsters.
I urge everyone to stay inside until this situation-- Dave.
Dave! Oh, shit!
Wicked.
Looks like they've built a barricade.
And there's fat Elvis.
Hit him in the jiggly. [ Grunts ] Hey!
Not bad! Hit it!
My door!
Can't shake me! Still here, dicks!
Relax body. Relax body.
Hope they have an elevator.
[ Roy ] Aw, shit!
Reverse the tunnel, the dead come pouring back.
We stay here forever.
Kind of a high-five moment.
All we gotta do is fire up this bad boy.
Yeah! Okay.
This is where it gets a little uncomfortable.
There's no great way to say this, so I'll just say it.
These ancient things, they often involve an element of--
I don't want to say human sacrifice, but-- human sacrifice.
I'll jump before you can even touch me.
Julia, come on. Come on, be cool.
This is an honor. I'm trusting you with the heavy shit. [ All Clamoring ] Yeah! Yeah!
Julia!
Uh-uh. Just in time.
Bobby! Don't!
No!
[ Roy ] Move!
Nice shot.
I'm gonna go get Julia. You take care of the Staff.
That golden pecker's coming down.
You frosty?
Icy hot, partner.
What now, Nick?
You know, it didn't have to be Julia,
but I just couldn't resist bringing it full circle.
Come on. It's good, right?
Get over here!
How's it coming, Roy?
It's harder than it looks!
Aah! Killing you never gets old, Nicky.
- Any time now! - I hear ya!
Come on, Roy!
Do some cowboy stuff!
Please! Roy!
There it is.
No.
Well, partner?
I have a new partner.
I missed you.
I missed you so much.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
It's okay. You're back with me now.
That's all I wanted.
But not like this.
Julia. You gotta live your life... without me.
You gotta live your life... without me.
I don't want to say good-bye.
You can't stay here.
It's okay.
Go.
I will always love you.
- Good-bye. - [ Gasps ]
She's gonna be okay. Thank you.
You owe me for that.
Let's settle up. Sure.
I would like to be allowed to design my own medal. Not so fast.
The Eternals went ahead and had your disciplinary hearing without you.
While we were saving the world?
Nick, as a new recruit, you've been let off with a warning.
Reasonable.
Roy, as punishment-- Punishment?
Yes. Fifty-three more years have been added to your term.
Fifty-three years? That's-That's a lot.
This is honky-tonk bullshit!
You just like having me around, don't you, Mildred?
My hat.
[ Chuckles ] You went off and found it?
I guess I could've bought you flowers once or twice.
I like violets.
She billy-goated me.
Something we used to do.
Why she covers up them ankles with them damn white boots,
never understand.
Fifty-three more years, huh?
Well, I still got some things to work on.
Hell, this is the third time I've been extended.
Oh, say, got you something.
What's this?
I knew you weren't happy with Grandpa Chen, so I pulled a few strings.
I knew you weren't happy with Grandpa Chen, so I pulled a few strings. Got you some new I.D.
Thank you. Thank you, Roy. I mean that.
This is great.
Aw, you gotta be shitting me.
General.
General.
Sir. General.
Sir. General.
General.
[MAN SHOUTS] Sir.
Lean and hungry.
Still nothing? Not a sign.
How long has he been gone? Nearly two hours.
Will they fight, sir? We shall know soon enough.
Soldier, I ordered you to move those catapults forward.
They're out of range. Range is good.
The danger to the cavalry-- It is acceptable. Agreed?
They say no.
[WHINNYING] Steady! Steady!
People should know when they're conquered.
Would you, Quintus? Would I?
Strength and honor. Strength and honor. Strength and honor.
Strength and honor. Strength and honor.
At my signal, unleash hell.
Load the catapults.
Infantry form up for advance.
Archers ready. Archers!
Nock! Nock!
Patres! MEN: Maximus!
Three weeks from now, I will be harvesting my crops.
Imagine where you will be,
and it will be so.
Hold the line! Stay with me!
If you find yourself alone,
riding in green fields with the sun on your face,
do not be troubled. For you are in Elysium,
and you're already dead!
Brothers,
what we do in life... echoes in eternity.
Pull!
Pull!
Pull!
MAN: Catapults ready, sir!
Archers, ignite!
Ignite!
Ignite!
MAN: Archers, draw!
Loose!
Loose!
MAN: All right, men, ready!
MAXIMUS: Hold the line!
Draw! Loose!
Loose! Loose!
Reload!
MAXIMUS: Hold the line!
Draw!
Loose!
MAXIMUS: Stay with me!
Stay with me!
MAXIMUS: Roma Victor!
[IN UNISON] Roma Victor!
Roma Victor!
Do you think he's really dying?
He's been dying for 10 years.
If he weren't really dying, he wouldn't have sent for us.
Maybe he just misses us.
And the senators? He wouldn't have summoned them-- Peace, Commodus.
He wouldn't have summoned them-- Peace, Commodus. After two weeks on the road,
After two weeks on the road, your incessant scheming is hurting my head.
He's made his decision.
He's going to announce it.
He will name me.
The first thing I shall do...
when--
Is honor him with games worthy of His Majesty.
For now, the first thing I shall do is have a hot bath.
MAN: Your Highness?
MAN: We seem to be almost there, sir.
Sire. Where's the Emperor?
He's at the front, sire. They've been gone for 19 days.
The wounded are still coming in.
My horse.
MAN: My lord.
Kiss?
You have proved your valor... yet again, Maximus.
Let us hope for the last time.
There's no one left to fight, sire.
Ah. There is always someone left to fight.
How can I reward Rome's greatest general?
Let me go home.
Ah. Home.
They honor you, Caesar.
It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.
MAN: Roma Victor!
Have I missed it? Have I missed the battle?
You have missed the war.
Father, congratulations.
I shall sacrifice a hundred bulls to honor your triumph.
Save the bulls.
Honor Maximus. He won the battle.
General. Highness.
Rome salutes you, and I embrace you as a brother.
It has been too long, my old friend. Highness. Here, Father.
Highness. Here, Father.
Take my arm.
I think it is time for me to leave.
So much for the glory of Rome.
Magnificent battle.
General. Still alive? Still alive?
The gods must have a sense of humor. The gods must love you. Valerius.
The gods must love you. Valerius.
Back to barracks, General? Or to Rome?
Home. My wife, the son, the harvest.
Maximus the farmer. I still have difficulty imagining that.
You know, dirt cleans off a lot easier than blood, Quintus.
There he is. Highness.
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear,
and you'll wake up one day, and all you'll say is, "Republic, republic, republic."
Well, why not? Rome was founded as a republic.
Yes, and in a republic the Senate has the power.
But Senator Gaius isn't influenced by that, of course.
Where do you stand, General? Emperor or Senate?
The soldier has the advantage of being able to look his enemy in the eye, Senator.
GAIUS: Well, with an army behind you, you could be extremely political.
I warned you. Now I shall save you. Senators.
Maximus.
I'm going to need good men like you.
How may I be of service, Highness?
You're a man who knows what it is to command.
You give your orders, the orders are obeyed, and the battle is won.
the orders are obeyed, and the battle is won.
But these senators,
they scheme and squabble and flatter and deceive.
Maximus, we must save Rome from the politicians, my friend.
Can I count on you... when the time comes?
Highness, when your father releases me,
I intend to return home.
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.
Don't get too comfortable. I may call on you before long.
Lucilla's here. Did you know?
She's not forgotten you.
And now you're the great man.
If only you had been born a man.
What a caesar you would have made.
Father.
You would have been strong.
I wonder, would you have been just?
I would have been what you taught me to be.
How was your journey?
Long. Uncomfortable. Why have I come?
Long. Uncomfortable. Why have I come? I need your help. With your brother.
I need your help. With your brother.
[CHUCKLING] Of course.
He loves you. He always has.
And...
he will need you now more than ever.
Enough of politics.
Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter...
and I am a good father.
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?
MAN: Good morning.
MAN: I need three more horses.
COMMODUS: Two! Three!
Four! [BLADES CLANKING]
One! Two!
You sent for me, Caesar?
Caesar?
Tell me again, Maximus. Why are we here?
For the glory of the Empire, sire.
Ah, yes.
Ah, yes, I remember.
Do you see that map, Maximus?
That is the world which I created.
For 25 years...
I have conquered, spilt blood, expanded the Empire.
Since I became caesar, I've known four years without war.
Four years of peace in 20.
And for what?
I brought the sword. Nothing more.
Caesar, your life--
Please. Please don't call me that.
Come. Please.
Come sit.
Let us talk together now...
very simply, as men.
Well, Maximus... talk.
Five thousand of my men are out there in the freezing mud.
Three thousand of them are bloodied and cleaved. Two thousand will never leave this place.
I will not believe that they fought and died for nothing.
And what would you believe, Maximus--? They fought for you... And for Rome.
They fought for you... And for Rome.
And what is Rome, Maximus?
I've seen much of the rest of the world.
It is brutal and cruel and dark. Rome is the light.
Yet you have never been there.
You have not seen what it has become.
I am dying, Maximus.
When a man sees his end,
he wants to know there was some purpose to his life.
How will the world speak my name in years to come?
Will I be known as the philosopher?
The warrior? The tyrant?
Or will I be the emperor who gave Rome back her true self?
There was once a dream that was Rome.
You could only whisper it.
Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish.
It was so fragile.
And I fear that it will not survive the winter.
Maximus,
let us whisper now,
together, you and I.
You have a son.
Tell me about your home.
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.
A very simple place.
Pink stones that warm in the sun.
A kitchen garden that smells of herbs in the day,
jasmine in the evening.
Through the gate is a giant poplar. Figs, apples, pears.
The soil, Marcus-- Black.
Black like my wife's hair. [CHUCKLES]
Grapes on the south slopes, olives on the north.
Wild ponies play near my house. They tease my son. He wants to be one of them.
They tease my son. He wants to be one of them.
When was the last time you were home? Two years, 264 days, and this morning.
I envy you, Maximus.
It's a good home. Worth fighting for?
There is one more duty...
that I ask of you before you go home.
What would you have me do, Caesar?
I want you to become the protector of Rome after I die.
I will empower you to one end alone.
To give power back to the people of Rome...
and end the corruption that has crippled it.
Will you accept this great honor that I have offered you?
With all my heart, no.
Maximus,
that is why it must be you.
But surely a prefect, a senator, somebody who knows the city,
somebody who knows the city, who understands her politics.
But you have not been corrupted by her politics.
And Commodus? Commodus is not a moral man.
You have known that since you were young.
Commodus cannot rule.
He must not rule.
You are the son that I should have had.
Commodus will accept my decision.
He knows that you command the loyalty of the army.
I.. I need some time, sire.
Yes.
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.
Now embrace me as my son.
And bring an old man another blanket.
LUCILLA: My father favors you now. My lady.
It was not always so.
Many things change. Many things. Not everything.
Many things. Not everything.
Maximus, stop.
Let me see your face.
Hm. You seem upset.
I lost many men.
What did my father want with you?
[SIGHING] To wish me well before I leave for home.
You're lying. I could always tell when you were lying
because you were never any good at it.
I never acquired your comfort with it. True.
But then you never had to.
Life is more simple for a soldier.
Or do you think me heartless?
I think you have a talent for survival.
Maximus, stop.
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?
No. I'm tired from battle.
It hurts you to see my father so fragile.
Commodus expects that my father will announce his succession within days.
Will you serve my brother as you served his father?
I will always serve Rome.
Do you know, I still remember you in my prayers.
Oh, yes. I pray.
I was sad to hear of your husband's death. I mourned him.
Thank you. And I hear you have a son.
Yes. Lucius.
He'll be nearly 8 years old.
My son is also nearly 8.
I thank you for your prayers.
MAXIMUS: Ancestors, I ask for your guidance.
Blessed mother, come to me with the gods' desire for my future.
Blessed father, watch over my wife and son with a ready sword.
Whisper to them, I live only to hold them again.
Ancestors, I honor you...
and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me.
Cicero?
Sir.
You don't find it hard to do your duty?
Sometimes I do what I want to do.
The rest of the time I do what I have to.
We may not be able to go home after all.
MARCUS: Are you ready to do your duty for Rome?
Yes, Father.
You will not be emperor.
Which wiser, older man is to take my place?
My powers will pass to Maximus...
to hold in trust... until the Senate is ready to rule once more.
Rome is to be a republic again.
Maximus. Yes.
My decision disappoints you?
You wrote to me once,
listing the four chief virtues.
Wisdom,
justice, fortitude...
and temperance.
As I read the list, I knew I had none of them.
But I have other virtues, Father.
Ambition.
That can be a virtue when it drives us to excel.
Resourcefulness. Courage.
Perhaps not on the battlefield, but... there are many forms of courage.
Devotion... to my family...
and to you.
But none of my virtues were on your list.
Even then it was as if you didn't want me for your son.
Oh, Commodus.
You go too far.
I search the faces of the gods... for ways to please you, to make you proud.
for ways to please you, to make you proud.
One kind word,
one full hug...
where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight,
would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years.
What is it in me you hate so much? Shh, Commodus.
Shh, Commodus.
All I've ever wanted... was to live up to you, Caesar.
was to live up to you, Caesar.
Father.
Commodus...
...your faults as a son is my failure as a father.
Come.
[SOBBING] Father.
I would butcher the whole world... if you would only love me!
Maximus, the emperor needs you. It's urgent.
Lament with me, brother. Our great father is dead.
MAXIMUS: How did he die?
COMMODUS: The surgeons say there was no pain.
His breath gave out as he slept.
Father.
Your emperor asks for your loyalty, Maximus.
Take my hand.
I only offer it once.
Quintus.
Hail, Caesar.
I must talk to the senators. I need their counsel.
Wake Gaius and Falco. Gaius and Falco.
Sword. Sword.
Maximus, please be careful. That was not prudent.
Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.
QUINTUS: The Emperor died of natural causes.
Why are you armed, Quintus? Guards!
Please don't fight, Maximus.
QUINTUS: I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.
Ride until dawn... and then execute him.
Quintus, look at me. Look at me!
Promise me that you will look after my family.
Your family will meet you in the afterlife. No!
Kneel.
MAXIMUS: Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son.
Whisper to them that I live only to hold them again.
At least give me a clean death.
A soldier's death.
The frost--
Sometimes it makes the blade stick.
Praetorian!
MARCUS: When was the last time you were home?
MAXIMUS: Two years, 264 days, and this morning.
BOTH [OVERLAPPING]: Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son with a ready sword.
Whisper to them I live only to hold them again.
For all else is dust and air. Whisper to them I live only to hold them again.
Whisper to them I live only to hold them again.
For all else is dust and air.
[HORSES NEIGHING] Papa! Papa!
Don't die.
MAN: You'll meet them again. [SCREAMING]
MAN: Not yet.
No! They will clean it. Wait and see.
Don't die.
They'll feed you to the lions.
They are worth more than we are.
Better now?
Clean. You see?
MAN: Proximo! My old friend.
Every day is a great day when you are here.
Today... is your most fortunate day.
Those giraffes you sold me... they won't mate. What?
they won't mate. What? They just walk around eating and not mating.
They just walk around eating and not mating.
You sold me queer giraffes.
I want my money back.
Not a chance. Aaarggh!
I do special price for you.
On what?
Have you seen my new stock? Come and see them.
Do any of them fight? I've got a match coming up.
Some are good for fighting, others for dying.
You need both, I think.
Get up!
What's your trade?
I was a hunter.
Oh, no. I bought him from a salt mine in Carthage.
Sit down!
PROXIMO: Mark of the legion.
Deserter. MAN: Maybe so. But who cares?
He's a Spaniard. PROXIMO: I'll take six...
for 1,000. MAN: One thousand?
The Numidian alone is worth 2,000!
PROXIMO: These slaves are rotten.
It all adds to the flavor. No! No-no-no. Wait-wait.
It all adds to the flavor. No! No-no-no. Wait-wait. Wait! We can negotiate.
Wait! We can negotiate.
I'll give you 2,000... and four for the beasts.
That's 5,000 for an old friend.
Come on! How long does it take to get into my own house?
I am Proximo!
I shall be closer to you for the next few days,
which will be last of your miserable lives,
than that bitch of a mother that brought you screaming into this world!
that brought you screaming into this world!
I did not pay good money for you for your company!
I paid it so that I could profit from your death.
And as your mother was there at your beginning,
so I shall be there at your end.
And when you die, and die you shall,
your transition shall be to the sound of:
Gladiators, I salute you.
MAN 1: Red! MAN 2: Red.
[GRUNTING] Yellow!
Yellow.
Good.
Red. Red!
Spaniard!
PROXIMO: That's enough for the moment!
His time will come.
[SNICKERING] Next!
Spaniard, why don't you fight?
We all have to fight.
Is that the sign of your gods?
Will that not anger them?
The gods favor you.
Red is the gods' color.
You will need their help today.
Some of you are thinking you won't fight.
Some that you can't fight.
They all say that,
until they're out there.
Listen.
CROWD: Kill. Kill. Kill.
Thrust this into another man's flesh,
and then they will applaud and love you for that.
You--
You may begin to love them...
for that.
Ultimately, we're all dead men.
Sadly, we cannot choose how, but...
we can decide how we meet that end...
in order that we are remembered... as men.
as men.
MAN: On the left, draw your shields!
On the right, draw your swords!
CROWD: Kill. Kill.
Pair them up, red with yellow.
Next!
Next!
Go away! [ANGRY, INDISTINCT SHOUTING]
He enters Rome like a conquering hero.
But what has he conquered?
Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.
I think he could do very well.
For Rome or for you?
GRACCHUS: Go to your mother, Lucius. It's what she'd like.
Lucius!
Mother!
Hail, Caesar.
Senators.
Rome greets her new emperor.
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome, Highness.
Thank you, Falco. And for the loyal subjects,
Thank you, Falco. And for the loyal subjects, I trust they weren't too expensive. Caesar.
I trust they weren't too expensive. Caesar. Gracchus.
All Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar.
There are many matters that require your attention.
MAN: To order, then! To order!
For your guidance, Caesar,
the Senate has prepared a series of protocols...
to begin addressing the many problems in the city.
Beginning with basic sanitation for the Greek quarter...
to combat the plague which is already springing up there.
So if Caesar-- Shh.
Don't you see, Gracchus?
That's the very problem, isn't it?
My father spent all his time at study...
At books and learning and philosophy.
He spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the Senate.
And all the while, the people have forgotten.
But the Senate is the People, sire.
Chosen from among the people
to speak for the people.
I doubt that many of the people eat so well as you do, Gracchus.
Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.
I think I understand my own people.
Then, perhaps Caesar will be so good as to teach us...
out of his own extensive experience.
I call it love. [CHUCKLING]
I am their father. The people are my children.
And I shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly--
Have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire?
No. But if you interrupt me again...
I assure you that you shall.
Senator, my brother is very tired.
Leave your list with me.
Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.
My lady, as always,
My lady, as always, your lightest touch commands obedience.
Who are they to lecture me?
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.
What uses? All they do is talk.
It should be just... you and me...
It should be just... you and me... and Rome. Don't even think it!
and Rome. Don't even think it!
There's always been a Senate.
Rome has changed.
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.
Of course, but leave the people their--
Illusions.
Traditions.
My father's war against the barbarians--
He said it himself, it achieved nothing.
But the people loved him. The people always love victories.
Why?
They didn't see the battles.
What do they care about Germania? They care about the greatness of Rome.
The greatness of Rome.
Well, what is that?
It's an idea.
Greatness--
Greatness is a vision.
Exactly. A vision.
Do you not see, Lucilla?
I will give the people a vision of Rome, and they'll love me for it.
And they'll soon forget the tedious sermonizing
And they'll soon forget the tedious sermonizing of a few dry, old men.
I will give the people the greatest vision of their lives.
MAN: Vino, vino, vino! White and red wine for your drinking pleasure!
Vino, vino, vino! Red and white wine for your drinking pleasure!
Games.
One hundred and fifty days of games.
He's cleverer than I thought.
Oh, clever.
The whole of Rome would be laughing at him...
if they weren't so afraid of his Praetorians.
Fear and wonder-- A powerful combination.
You really think the people will be seduced by that?
I think he knows what Rome is. Rome is the mob.
Conjure magic for them, and they'll be distracted.
Take away their freedom and still they'll roar.
The beating heart of Rome... is not the marble of the Senate.
It's the sand of the Colosseum.
He'll bring them death,
and they will love him for it.
CROWD: Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!
Spaniard. Spaniard.
Spaniard. Spaniard.
Spaniard. Spaniard.
Guard!
Are you not entertained?
Are you not entertained?
Is this not why you are here?
MAN: Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!
CROWD [IN UNISON]: Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!
What do you want?
Girl?
Boy?
You sent for me? Yes, I did.
You're good, Spaniard, but you're not that good.
You could be magnificent.
I'm required to kill, so I kill.
That is enough.
That's enough for the provinces, but not for Rome.
[SQUEALS] The young emperor... has arranged a series of spectacles
to commemorate his father, Marcus Aurelius.
I find that amusing...
since it was Marcus Aurelius-- the wise, the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius
the wise, the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius --that closed us down.
So finally, after five years of scratching a living
in flea-infested villages,
we're finally going back to where we belong,
the Colosseum.
[INHALING] Oh, you should see the Colosseum, Spaniard.
Fifty thousand Romans...
watching every movement of your sword,
willing you to make that killer blow.
[WHISPERING] The silence before you strike...
and the noise afterwards,
it rises. It rises up like-- Like th-- Like a storm...
Like th-- Like a storm...
As if you were the thunder god himself.
You were a gladiator?
Yes, I was.
You won your freedom?
[IN NORMAL VOICE] A long time ago, the emperor...
presented me with a rudius.
presented me with a rudius. It's just a wooden sword.
It's just a wooden sword.
The symbol of your freedom. He--
He touched me on the shoulder, and I was free.
You knew Marcus Aurelius?
I did not say I knew him. I said he touched me on the shoulder once.
You asked me what I want.
I too want to stand in front of the emperor...
as you did.
Then, listen to me. Learn from me.
I wasn't the best because I killed quickly.
I was the best because the crowd loved me.
Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom.
I will win the crowd.
I will give them something they have never seen before.
So, Spaniard, we shall go to Rome together... and have bloody adventures.
And the great whore will suckle us until we are...
fat and happy and can suckle no more.
And then,
when enough men have died,
perhaps you will have your freedom.
Here. Use this.
It's somewhere out there--
My country, my home.
My wife is preparing food.
My daughters carry water from the river.
Will I ever see them again?
I think no.
Do you believe you'll see them again when you die?
I think so.
But then, I will die soon.
They will not die for many years.
I'll have to wait.
But you would... wait.
Of course.
You see, my wife... and my son...
are already waiting for me.
You'll meet them again.
But not yet.
Not yet. Unless--
Not yet. Unless-- Not yet.
Not yet.
MAN: Out!
Go, go. Out!
PROXIMO: Good to see you again, old friend.
[WHISPERING] Bring me fortune.
Have you ever seen anything like that before?
I didn't know men could build such things.
Win the crowd.
MAN: Get Inside! Move. Inside.
He sleeps so well because he's loved.
Come, brother. It's late.
I will make Rome the wonder of the ages.
That is what Gracchus and his friends don't understand.
All my desires are splitting my head to pieces.
Commodus, drink this tonic.
I think the time is almost right.
I could announce the dissolution of the Senate...
at the celebration to honor our father. You think I should?
Are the people ready?
I think you need your rest now.
Will you stay with me?
Still afraid of the dark, brother?
Still.
[CHUCKLING] Always.
Stay with me tonight?
You know I won't.
Then kiss me.
Sleep, brother.
MAN: Come on now. Get out of the way!
I want you. I want you. I want you so--
SOLDIER: All right, Let him pass!
[BETTORS CLAMORING] MAN: Sixty!
MAN: Five hundred!
The emperor wants battles, and I don't want to sacrifice my best fighters.
The crowd wants battles, so the emperor gives them battles.
And you get the battle of Carthage.
The massacre of Carthage.
Oh, why don't you go down to the prison and round up all the beggars and thieves.
We've done that.
We've done that. If you want to give away the best gladiators in the whole of the empire,
then I want double the rates.
You'll get your contract rates, or you'll get your contract canceled.
You don't like it?
Then you can crawl back down that shit-hole that you came from.
MAN: Cassius, please! Please, Cassius!
Gladiator, are you the one they call the Spaniard?
Yes.
They said you were a giant.
They said you could crush a man's skull with one hand. A man's? No.
A man's? No.
A boy's.
They have good horses in Spain? Some of the best.
This is Argento, and this is Scarto.
They were my horses.
They were taken from me.
I like you, Spaniard.
I shall cheer for you. They let you watch the games?
My uncle says it makes me strong.
And what does your father say?
My father's dead.
Master Lucius, it is time.
I have to go.
Your name is Lucius?
Lucius Verus, after my father.
MAN: Lower!
MAN: Claudius! MAN 2: Yes?
MAN: More shields!
HANDLER: When the emperor enters, raise your weapons, salute him,
raise your weapons, salute him, and then speak together!
Face the emperor and don't turn your back on him!
Go, and die with honor!
MAN: Hail, mighty Caesar!
CROWD: Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
CROWD: Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
[IN UNISON] And we who are about to die, salute you!
CASSIUS: On this day,
we reach back to hallowed antiquity...
to bring you a recreation of the second fall of mighty Carthage!
On the barren plain of Zarma,
there stood the invincible armies... of the barbarian, Hannibal.
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors from all brute nations
bent on merciless... destruction...conquest.
destruction...conquest.
Your emperor is pleased to give you
the barbarian horde!
Anyone here been in the army?
No. MAN: Yes.
I served with you at Vindobona.
You can help me.
Whatever comes out of these gates,
we've got a better chance of survival if we work together.
Do you understand?
If we stay together, we survive.
I'm pleased to bring you the legionnaires of Scipio Africanus!
To the death!
MAXIMUS: Stay close!
Come together!
Staggered columns!
Staggered columns!
MAN 1: Soon all your men will be slain. MAN 2: You don't have a chance!
MAXIMUS: Lock your shields! Stay as one!
Hold!
Hold!
As one! [IN UNISON] As one!
Well done!
Hold!
Diamond! Diamond!
Yes! [GASPS]
Hagen! [GROANS]
This column to the chariots! This column--
This column to the chariots! This column-- Stay with me! [GRUNTING]
MAXIMUS: Quickly!
Get out there! Hurry!
Maximus!
Single column! Single column!
GLADIATORS: Single column!
We win!
My history's a little hazy, Cassius,
but shouldn't the barbarians lose the battle of Carthage?
Uh, yes, sire.
Um, forgive me, sire.
COMMODUS: No, I rather enjoy surprises.
Who is he?
They call him the Spaniard, sire.
I think I'll meet him.
Yes, sire.
MAN: Hail to the barbarians!
MAN: Forward! Arms at ready!
Drop your weapons!
Gladiator, the emperor has asked for you.
I'm at the emperor's service.
Rise. Rise.
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard. I don't think there's ever been a gladiator to match you.
I don't think there's ever been a gladiator to match you.
As for this young man, he insists you are Hector reborn.
he insists you are Hector reborn. Or was it Hercules?
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself and tell us all your real name?
You do have a name?
My name is Gladiator.
How dare you show your back to me?
Slave!
You will remove your helmet and tell me your name.
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius,
commander of the armies of the north, general of the Felix Legions,
loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius,
father to a murdered son,
husband to a murdered wife...
and I will have my vengeance...
in this life or the next.
Arms!
CROWD: Live! Live! Live!
Live! Live! Live! Live! Live! Live!
Guards, at rest!
GLADIATORS [IN UNISON]: Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
Why is he still alive?
I don't know.
He shouldn't be alive.
It vexes me.
I'm terribly vexed.
I did what I had to do.
If Father had had his way, the empire would have been torn apart.
You do see that?
Yes.
What did you feel when you saw him?
I felt nothing.
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?
No more than I wounded him.
They lied to me in Germania.
They told me he was dead.
If they lie to me, they don't respect me.
If they don't respect me, how can they ever love me?
Then you must let the legions know...
their treachery will not go unpunished.
Poor sister, I wouldn't want to be your enemy.
What will you do?
This way!
Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions.
I knew your brother would send assassins.
I didn't realize he would send his best.
Maximus, he doesn't know.
My family was burned and crucified while they were still alive.
I knew nothing-- Don't lie to me!
I wept for them.
As you wept for your father?
As you wept for your father?
As you wept for your father? I have been living in a prison of fear since that day.
To be unable to mourn your father for fear of your brother.
To live in terror every moment of every day
because your son is heir to the throne.
Oh, I have wept.
My son was innocent.
So is mine.
Must my son die too, before you will trust me?
What does it matter if I trust you or not?
The gods have spared you. Don't you understand?
Today I saw a slave become more powerful than the emperor of Rome.
The gods have spared me?
I am at their mercy, with the power only to amuse a mob!
That is power. The mob is Rome.
And while Commodus controls them, he controls everything.
Listen to me.
My brother has enemies, most of all in the Senate.
But while the people follow him,
no one would dare stand up to him until you.
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.
There are some politicians who have dedicated their lives to Rome.
One man above all.
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?
Do you not understand?
I may die in this cell tonight, or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!
What possible difference can I make?
This man wants what you want.
Then have him kill Commodus!
I knew a man once,
a noble man, a man of principle
who loved my father.
And my father loved him.
This man served Rome well.
That man is gone.
Your brother did his work well.
Let me help you.
Yes, you can help me.
Forget you ever knew me...
and never come here again.
Guard! The lady has finished with me.
Maximus, you commanded legions?
You had many victories?
Yes.
In Germania?
In many countries.
MAN: General.
You have a great name.
He must kill your name before he kills you.
Yes, at the far end.
Senator Gaius. Hello.
Senator Gracchus. Don't often see you
enjoying the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.
I don't pretend to be a man of the people, Senator.
But I do try to be a man for the people.
CROWD: Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
CASSIUS: People of Rome!
On the fourth day of Antioch,
we can celebrate the 64th day of the games.
And, in his majestic charity,
the Emperor has deigned this day to favor the people of Rome...
with an historical final match.
Returning to the Colosseum today... after five years in retirement, Caesar
after five years in retirement, Caesar is pleased to bring you the only undefeated champion
in Roman history,
the legendary Tigris of Gaul!
He knows too well how to manipulate the mob.
He knows too well how to manipulate the mob. Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Rome, Proximo.
Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Rome, Proximo. This is not it! This is not it!
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.
We mortals are but shadows and dust.
Shadows and dust, Maximus!
CASSIUS: Representing the training lyceum of Antonius Proximo,
Caesar is proud to give you... Aelius Maximus!
CROWD: Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
They embrace him like he's one of their own.
The mob is fickle, brother. He'll be forgotten in a month.
CROWD: Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
No, much sooner than that.
It's been arranged.
We who are about to die salute you.
MAN: We're with you, Maximus!
MAN: Come on, finish it!
No! Pull! Pull!
Yeah!
Loose! Loose! Loose! Loose!
Gut him! Kill him!
CROWD: Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill!
MAN: Maximus! Maximus the Merciful!
CROWD: Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
MAN: Forward, guards! On battery!
CROWD: Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
What am I going to do with you?
You simply won't...
die.
Are we so different, you and I?
You take life when you have to... as I do.
I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.
Then take it now.
They tell me your son...
squealed like a girl...
when they nailed him to the cross.
And your wife... moaned like a whore...
when they ravaged her...
again and again...
and again.
The time for honoring yourself will soon be at an end,
Highness.
CROWD: Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
General! General!
General!
General! General! Get back!
General! Cicero!
Maximus! Maximus!
[CROWD CONTINUES CHANTING] CICERO: General!
General. Where are you camped?
General. Where are you camped? Ostia.
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
We love you, Maximus! Praise the victor!
Tell the men their general lives. Find me.
Move along! Find me!
Can they hear you?
Who? Your family, in the afterlife.
Oh, yes. What do you say to them?
To my boy,
I tell him I will see him again soon, to keep his heels down when he's riding his horse.
to keep his heels down when he's riding his horse.
To my wife--
That is not your business.
And now they love Maximus for his mercy.
So I can't just kill him, or it makes me even more unmerciful!
The whole thing's like some crazed nightmare.
FALCO: He is defying you.
FALCO: He is defying you. His every victory is an act of defiance.
The mob sees this, and so do the Senate.
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.
Kill him. No.
I will not make a martyr of him.
I have been told... of a certain sea snake...
which has a very unusual method of attracting its prey.
It will lie at the bottom of the ocean as if wounded.
Then its enemies will approach, and yet it will lie quite still.
And then its enemies will take little bites of it,
and yet it remains... still.
So...
we will lie still...
and let our enemies come to us and nibble.
Have every senator followed.
Maximus.
Cicero, my old friend. I thought perhaps I'd seen you for the last time.
I thought you were dead. Close.
How long have the men been in Ostia? All winter.
And how do they look?
Fattened and bored.
Who's in command?
Some fool from Rome.
How soon do you think they could be ready to fight? For you, tomorrow.
I need you to do something for me.
MAN: Come see. Witness.
If you haven't been in the arena, you can see the show here.
Giant Maximus is defeating our Emperor Commodus. What are we to do?
What are we to do? He's defying everyone by doing this...
He's defying everyone by doing this...
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, he got him! GUARD: Make way!
GUARD: Make way! Give way! Give way!
Give way! Give way!
MAN: Three casks of red wine...
My lady? I served your father at Vindobona.
GUARD: Back. CICERO: My lady.
I served your father at Vindobona.
Back! And I served the General Maximus.
Back! And I served the General Maximus. I serve him still.
Stop.
Stop. GUARD: Stop!
LUCILLA: Stand back.
The General sends word. He will meet your politician.
For your loyalty, soldier.
Thank you, my lady.
Up!
LUCILLA: Leave us.
Senator Gracchus.
General.
I hope my coming here today is evidence enough that...
I hope my coming here today is evidence enough that... you can trust me.
The Senate is with you? The Senate?
Yes. I can speak for them.
You can buy my freedom and smuggle me out of Rome?
To what end?
Get me outside the city walls.
Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia. My army's encamped there.
My army's encamped there.
By nightfall of the second day, I shall return at the head of 5,000 men.
But the legions all have new commanders... loyal to Commodus.
Let my men see me alive,
and you shall see where their loyalties lie.
This is madness.
No Roman army has entered the capital in a hundred years. Gracchus--
in a hundred years. Gracchus-- I will not trade one dictatorship for another!
The time for half-measures and talk is over, Senator.
And after your glorious coup, what then?
You'll take your 5,000 warriors and leave?
I will leave.
The soldiers will stay for your protection,
under the command of the Senate.
So once all of Rome is yours, you'll just give it back to the people?
Tell me why.
Because that was the last wish of a dying man.
I will kill Commodus.
The fate of Rome I leave to you.
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.
His daughter trusts you.
I will trust you.
But we have little time.
Give me two days...
and I will buy your freedom.
And you--
You stay alive.
Or I'll be dead.
Now we must go.
It won't work.
The Emperor knows too much.
And as for me,
it's becoming dangerous.
You will be paid on my return.
I give you my word. [CHUCKLES]
Your word? What if you don't return?
Do you remember what it was to have trust, Proximo?
Trust?
Who am I to trust?
I will kill Commodus.
Why would I want that?
He makes me rich.
Oh, I--
I know that you are a man of your word, General.
I know that you would die for honor.
You would die for Rome.
You would die for the memory of your ancestors.
But I, on the other hand...
...am an entertainer.
Hm? Guard!
He killed the man who set you free.
Praetorians, master.
Halt!
COMMODUS: Where have you been?
I sent for you.
Please, brother.
What's troubling you?
Does Gracchus have a new lover?
I don't know.
I thought you'd seen him.
He infects everyone like a putrid fever.
For the health of Rome, the Senate must be bled.
And he will bleed too...
very soon.
But not tonight.
Do you remember what our father said once?
"It's a dream...
a frightful dream...
life is."
Do you think that's true?
I don't know.
I think it is.
And I have only you to share it with.
Open your mouth.
You know I love you.
And I love you.
Out. Get out!
Move!
Congratulations, General.
You've got very... persuasive friends.
My brother's had Gracchus arrested.
We daren't wait any longer. You must leave tonight.
Proximo will come at midnight and take you to the gate.
Your servant, Cicero, will be waiting there with horses.
You have done all this?
Yes. You risk too much.
I have much to pay for.
You have nothing to pay for.
You love your son. You're strong for him.
I am tired of being strong.
My brother hates all the world,
and you most of all.
Because your father chose me. No.
Because my father loved you.
And because I loved you.
A long time ago.
Was I very different then?
You laughed more.
I have felt alone all my life,
except with you.
I must go.
Yes.
LUCIUS: There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There.
There. There. And I've got you.
Isn't it late to be playing legionnaire?
I'm not a legionnaire.
Not a legionnaire? I'm a gladiator.
A gladiator?
Gladiators only fight in the games.
Wouldn't you rather be a great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?
a great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!
The savior of Rome?
And who said that?
Where's Lucius?
He's with the Emperor, my lady.
LUCIUS: She couldn't. COMMODUS: Yes, she did.
She took it from a basket...
and pressed it to her breast, right here above her heart.
LUCIUS: It bit her in the breast?
Yes.
You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies
You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies behave very strangely
and do very odd things in the name of love.
I think it's silly. So do I.
So do I.
Sister, join us.
I've been reading to dear Lucius.
LUCIUS: I've been reading too.
Yes. He's a very clever little boy.
He'll make a grand emperor one day.
We've been reading about the great Mark Antony
and his adventures in Egypt.
The queen killed herself with a snake.
COMMODUS: And just wait until you hear what happened to our ancestors.
If you're very good,
tomorrow night I'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius.
He was betrayed...
by those closest to him.
By his own blood.
They whispered in dark corners... and went out late at night...
and conspired...
and conspired.
But the Emperor Claudius knew that they were up to something.
He knew they were busy little bees.
And one night he sat down with one of them...
and he looked at her...
and he said,
"Tell me what you've been doing, busy little bee,
or I shall strike down those dearest to you.
You shall watch as I bathe in their blood."
And the Emperor was heartbroken.
The little bee had wounded him more deeply than anyone else could ever have done.
And what do you think happened then, Lucius?
I don't know, Uncle.
The little bee told him everything.
MAN: Open, in the name of the Emperor!
Proximo!
Open the gates in the name of the Emperor!
Proximo! [GATES RATTLING]
Open the gates!
Open the gates, Proximo!
Do you want to die, old man?
Here.
Everything is prepared.
Everything is prepared. It seems you've won your freedom. Proximo,
It seems you've won your freedom. Proximo,
are you in danger of becoming a good man?
Juba? All enemies of the Emperor, die!
Open the gates! The Emperor commands!
Pull!
Move! Two columns on the left!
I only need moments, so do not be careless with your lives.
If you don't want any part of this,
If you don't want any part of this, go back to your cells.
We'll wait here for you, Maximus.
ALL: Strength and honor.
Go!
Strength and honor.
Aim! Break the bars!
Shadows and dust.
Maximus!
[GAGGING] I'm sorry.
[GRUNTS] No!
It's done.
And what of my nephew?
And what of his mother?
Should they share her lover's fate?
Or should I be merciful?
Commodus the Merciful.
Lucius will stay with me now.
And if his mother...
so much as looks at me... in a manner that displeases me...
he will die.
If she decides... to be noble...
and takes her own life...
he will die.
And as for you,
you will love me...
as I loved you.
You will provide me with an heir... of pure blood...
so that Commodus and his progeny... will rule for a thousand years.
Am I not merciful?
[SHOUTING] Am I not merciful?
CROWD: Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
Maximus.
Maximus.
Maximus.
They call for you.
The general who became a slave.
The slave who became a gladiator.
The gladiator who defied an emperor.
A striking story.
Now the people want to know how the story ends.
Only a famous death will do.
And what could be more glorious...
than to challenge the Emperor himself in the great arena?
You would fight me?
Why not?
Do you think I'm afraid?
I think you have been afraid all your life.
Unlike Maximus the Invincible, who knows no fear?
I knew a man who once said, "Death smiles at us all.
All a man can do is smile back."
I wonder.
Did your friend smile at his own death?
You must know.
He was your father.
You loved my father, I know.
But so did I.
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?
Smile for me now, brother.
Strap on his armor.
Conceal the wound.
CROWD: Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
SOLDIER: Ring formation!
Ring formation!
MAN: Off with his head, Maximus!
CROWD: Maximus! Maximus!
Quintus, sword!
Give me your sword!
Sword! Give me a sword!
Sheathe your swords!
QUINTUS: Sheathe your swords!
QUINTUS: Maximus.
Maximus.
Quintus.
Free my men.
Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated.
There was a dream that was Rome.
It shall be realized.
These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius.
Free the prisoners! Go!
Maximus.
Lucius is safe.
[SIGHING] Go to them.
You're home.
Is Rome worth one good man's life?
We believed it once.
Make us believe it again.
He was a soldier of Rome.
Honor him.
Who will help me carry him?
Now we are free.
I will see you again.
We have killed Mesopotamians!
We have killed Assyrians,
Mycenaeans, Sumerians.
But
we have never had the pleasure
of killing
an Akkadian.
Which limb do I take first?
May the gods have pity on you
because my brother will not.
You missed.
You're lucky we have the same mother.
[narrator] Before the time of the pyramids a fearsome horde came from the east
and swept across the barren lands of the ancient world.
By the law of the horde
their greatest warrior was proclaimed their king.
His name was Memnon.
He was the greatest swordsman the world had ever seen.
With the predictions of a sorcerer
who could foretell the outcome of every battle,
Memnon slaughtered all who resisted him
until only a brave few remained.
-Silence! -My father has called for silence!
Hold your tongues!
We are gathered in this place to put our differences aside.
There is still time for us, the last of the free tribes,
to stand together against this tyrant.
With his sorcerer at his side, no mortal can defeat Memnon.
And if the sorcerer were to die, what then?
And if the sorcerer were to die, what then? It's too late for your schemes, Pheron.
I have raided Memnon's caravans, broken the supply lines to his troops,
but he still swept across the land like a plague.
I will not send my people to their deaths in a battle that can't be won.
And what people would that be, Balthazar?
You are the ruler of nothing
but a pile of rocks and sand.
If I'm no king,
why are you on your knees before me?
Balthazar! Guards!
Akkadians. I thought they were wiped out long ago.
[King Pheron] They are the last of their kind.
By their hand, the sorcerer will die.
You put your faith in a clan of cutthroats who kill for money?
They are more than that. They are skilled assassins
trained for generations in the deadly arts.
And what price do these mercenaries ask from us, Father?
Twenty blood rubies.
-That's the last of our treasury. -Be quiet.
If these men kill the sorcerer, will you fight?
So be it.
As long as one of us still breathes
the sorcerer will die.
Assassin!
Him, we'll kill for free.
[Jesup] We can reach Memnon's encampment by nightfall.
When are you gonna get rid of that filthy beast?
He doesn't mean anything by it.
-Horses are faster. -But camels are smarter.
[Mathayus] That one's mine.
Live free.
Die well.
Stop. Stop. Listen to me. I am a high priest of Set.
Spare me, and I shall bless thee in five different languages.
You'll scream in five different languages. -Horse thief. -Wait! Wait!
-Horse thief. -Wait! Wait!
Hey! I'm not that heavy.
Look out for the fat one! He's behind you!
Help me! Help me! Whoever you are, help me!
-Oh, thank you. Thank you, good sir. -Quiet.
Surely you've heard of the enormous reward for my safe return.
[Jesup] The sorcerer's tent.
Back!
[guard 1] Make way! [guard 2] Find the other one!
You've been betrayed, Mathayus.
-You know my name? -And why you're here.
[guard 1] He's in the tent!
[guard 2] You! Move around back!
A living, breathing Akkadian. This is a rare pleasure.
I hear you train yourselves to bear great pain.
You must teach me this, if you live long enough.
Not looking so full of yourself, are you now, assassin?
You betrayed your own father?
Yes. He was very shocked.
You could tell by the look on his face.
By my father's head, I pledge my allegiance.
[Memnon] You have proven your loyalty, Takmet.
This one still lives.
Beautiful.
Bring him to me.
Mathayus. Mathayus.
Live free.
Die well, my brother.
So,
how shall this one die?
-He shall not die tonight. -Really?
-We shall see. -Nor shall he die by your hand
or any hand you command.
You have seen this in a vision?
To ignore this would bring great misfortune.
The gods show him favor on this night.
Just the gods?
A puzzle then.
How to kill you without using my hand or any hand I command?
[Arpid] Fascinating, isn't it?
The smoke, it causes the fire ants to abandon their homes, you see?
All the sooner to feast on our naked heads.
-You think this is funny? -It's a little bit funny. Yes.
You see, I am about to escape while you are about to die a horrible death for leaving me to die last night.
while you are about to die a horrible death for leaving me to die last night.
-So what are you waiting for? -You see that one up there?
He's been drinking that yak piss for about an hour now and sometime very soon...
Ah, you see?
Hey! Where's the horse thief?
All right. Come on. Get me outta here.
Do you promise not to kill me?
-Yes, I promise. -Remember, you are an Akkadian.
You make an oath, you always have to keep it, right?
That's right.
Promise to take me with you and share in the spoils of your adventures.
What? All right. Fine. Yes, I promise.
All right. Now hold still.
Oh, here's one. That's a big one!
My! Here comes the mother.
[Arpid] So, where are we going?
[Mathayus] To Memnon's kingdom to avenge my brother's death.
-Never touch the bow. -Not a problem.
-Who are you calling? -My ride.
It's a nice camel.
Not much room back here. Scoot up, please.
Hey! We had a deal!
That's right. And I haven't killed you yet.
[Memnon] What news from my sorceress today?
[Memnon] What news?
Your armies will conquer in the west.
Queen Isis's forces will scatter to the four winds.
Give the generals the news.
Have them make their armies ready for the final campaign.
Yes, my lord.
[Memnon] You think I'm cruel, don't you?
Perhaps you've forgotten what it's like outside these walls.
Heartless, ignorant, and savage.
But I can change that.
I will bring order after centuries of chaos.
An order which will last for 1,000 years.
Rivers of blood can never bring peace.
But they can bring obedience. That will suffice for now.
And when I have become the king of legend,
then you shall take your place beside me
on a throne and in my bed.
But, my lord,
in your bed I would lose my gift of sight
and you would lose your advantage in battle.
The day I speak of
is the day I no longer need your vision.
[Arpid] Gomorrah.
Let me tell you, after a hard day of looting and pillaging, there is no greater city than Gomorrah.
after a hard day of looting and pillaging, there is no greater city than Gomorrah.
Except maybe Sodom.
-I wish I could join you. -You're not going?
Believe me, I'd like to even the score with a few of those Red Guards myself.
But with the price I've got on my head, I'd never make it through those gates.
I have faith in you, my friend. You'll get us in.
You see? They've got the city sealed up tighter than a crab's buttocks.
I wish there was something I could do to help, but...
Oh, but there is.
What business do you have here?
I've come to collect a bounty.
-Horse thief. -Oh. I know this dog.
They'll behead him for sure this time.
He'll be all the prettier without it.
-What happened? -You got us in. I knew you could do it.
A jug of your finest wine for my road-weary friend here.
Wait a minute. The last thing that...
That I remember was this huge Akkadian fist coming straight into...
Here's your wine, sir.
Please, let me know if there's anything else you'd like.
It's good to be back in the big city.
-Watch my camel for me? -Gladly.
Been working here long time?
How's the kebab?
[merchant] Merchandise of the highest quality.
Virgin steel forged by the monks of Pompeii.
Here! Here they are! The world's finest swords.
You can't get respect in Gomorrah without a quality blade...
Birds of paradise, birds of prey.
The most beautiful birds in the world.
Hey, soldier. Those big muscles look cramped.
-Perhaps one of us can help you relax. -Maybe all of us.
Mister, mister. Guide, mister.
You need a guide to find your way in Gomorrah.
A good guide might be able to show me a way into Memnon's palace.
But a smart guide wouldn't, or he'd be shown into Memnon's dungeon.
I don't have it.
Do you wanna earn this one?
Get ready. I'll kill half, you kill half.
All right. I'll kill them all.
How about we go around them and not kill anybody?
-Good Lord. Are you going to kill me? -Maybe later.
Memnon's always threatening to have my head.
[Philos] Don't touch that.
-What is it? -That's my special magic powder.
[Tutu] Magic powder?
Yeah, magic powder.
It's a Chinese formula that I procured at great expense.
If I get the recipe right, it'll move mountains,
clear roadways in an instant.
Do great things, wonderful things.
Or terrible things.
Like all my inventions, Memnon will try to use it for war.
-Where is Memnon? -Oh, you mean to kill him, do you?
-Yes. -Well, in that case,
I'd say he was in the training courtyard.
Thank you!
[Tutu] No! Let me go!
I didn't do anything!
You know the penalty for thievery.
No!
Oh, no.
No!
[guard] Intruder!
Follow me!
-You again. -How do I get outta here?
Through that door.
-What's that? -That's one of my latest inventions.
It was meant to be a means of quick transportation
but there was a little problem with the landings.
[Thorak] Open!
-Open! -Don't touch that. You'll set it off.
Right.
-Oh. -Oh, my!
A man.
-What is this place? -Lord Memnon's harem.
-But he visits so rarely. -And it gets so lonely.
-Can't you leave me alone, Thorak? -Watch your tongue, Philos.
Careful with those! They're delicate instruments.
You're lucky Lord Memnon has a taste for your "science," you old fool.
If I find out you had anything to do with this intruder
I will send the executioner.
We know how to please.
-Oh, I'm sure you do, ladies, but I... -Stay with us.
-Stay with us. -That's nice, but now's not a good time.
We will make your every fantasy come true.
Kill him!
After him!
Go get him!
Well, are you gonna try to kill me or just stare at me?
Ow!
Take a breath.
Gods be praised!
How dare you touch me!
Sorceress, I am an Akkadian hired to kill you.
Now, I find myself in a position where you are of more use to me alive.
Don't make me change my mind.
And he said it's not the size of the hump,
it is the motion of the camel.
Alas, I must leave you now.
-There's the traitor! -Oh, great gods!
He is dead!
Just admit it, you smelly camel!
I am your master now! You belong to me!
He's dead! Dead!
Dead!
You are alive. I knew it!
Right.
I was just saying to the camel, "Camel, no one could kill our good friend Mathayus."
"Camel, no one could kill our good friend Mathayus."
Get on.
Why should I make it easy for you? You're sworn to kill me.
Others will die first.
That's comforting.
-So who is your friend? -Memnon's sorcerer.
Memnon's sorcerer? Are you insane? She's going to get us all killed!
Memnon will have to leave the safety of his palace to get her.
So you're going to use me first and then kill me?
I feel so much better.
I could always do it the other way around and kill you first.
So where are we going?
-The Valley of the Dead. -The Valley of the Dead?
Nobody goes to the Valley of the Dead!
That's why they call it the Valley of the Dead!
Wait for me, please!
Take a dozen of your best men, track him down, kill him,
and bring her back to me.
Send me news when he's dead.
-Yes, my lord. -My lord.
There are rumors spreading to the armies that she's gone.
-Is this true? -It is, my lord.
Then silence them! They must believe she is here,
if only for a short time.
And when you find the Akkadian,
give him this from me.
[Arpid] Are we where I think we are?
Yes.
Home.
Where are you going, Sorceress?
In a hurry to get back to Memnon? No, I'm in a hurry to get away from you. I'll never go back to Memnon.
No, I'm in a hurry to get away from you. I'll never go back to Memnon. He's kept me prisoner since I was a child.
Why did you help me that night in the tent?
I knew you were the one man who could help me escape.
Run if you like. There are worse dangers out there than me.
[Mathayus] What do you mean you can't find it?
-I know it's around here somewhere. -What are you looking for?
Just a little place to get out of the storm.
-What storm? -You'll see.
Thorak.
Memnon didn't come, did he?
-Sent his maggots to do his work. -He's smarter than you think.
Or more cowardly.
Can I go home now?
Stay here. Cover up.
You'll be safe.
He's attacking! Alone?
The sun has fried his brain.
One thousand duranas for the one that brings me his head.
[Thorak] Akkadian bastard!
Where is he?
This way!
You two first. Come on. Go.
Stay on the stones.
Come with me.
Don't touch that.
[Thorak] Coward!
Show your face!
The Akkadian.
Mathayus!
[Arpid] You are alive! You swatted them like flies! You are invincible!
You swatted them like flies! You are invincible!
Tell me. Do you think you can save him?
His fever's high. The poison was made with scorpion venom.
If he does live, the blood of the scorpion will always flow through his veins.
Sorceress.
It's a miracle.
She cured you. I knew it! I felt her magic!
It almost killed her, but the gods, they were on our side.
Why? Why would you risk your life to save mine?
Because I believe you can save the people.
The people are not my problem. Memnon is.
You and the people have the same problem.
Pardon, my lord. A message from Thorak.
Finally, the Akkadian is dead.
Is there something wrong, my lord?
Not at all. Everything is in order.
In fact, things are going so well
that I'm moving up our plans.
Tomorrow night, we feast to celebrate our impending victory.
And then we'll drive the last of the rebels into the sea.
Now, go.
My lord,
it is customary for the sorceress to be present at these meetings.
Why is she not here today?
-She's indisposed. -It is nothing serious, I hope.
If it were serious, then you would know about it.
Now, go!
She is alive. She is with him and he's coming here.
Get ready.
It works! It works!
My lady. How lovely to see you out here in this desolate place!
Let me show you. It works!
Come, come, come!
My lady sorceress.
You see? I worked it out.
My Chinese formula. My magic powder works!
All I needed was salt. Petered salt.
It was here all the time. This place is just full of it.
By the way, do any of you happen to have any water?
What do you think? Is it safe to drink?
Not anymore. Delicious. The sandstone must act as a natural filter.
Delicious. The sandstone must act as a natural filter.
Quiet.
I'm alive! I'm alive!
For the moment.
Mathayus.
Move!
Assassin. The gods are good to me.
When we last met, you offered to kill me.
Now I have a chance to return the favor.
You're trespassers here.
Our survival depends on this place being kept a secret.
So we have a problem as long as you're alive.
[Arpid] No problem. I can keep a secret like no other.
In fact, I cannot remember how we got here. We took a left turn...
-It's too late for that. -[Queen Isis] Balthazar!
This place is sanctuary for all of Memnon's enemies. -You know that. -This man is dangerous.
-You know that. -This man is dangerous.
-Your judgment is clouded. -My judgment keeps all of you alive.
This man cannot be trusted, and I'll prove it.
Bring the woman to me.
The first man to touch her will have to come through me.
I had hoped for nothing less.
That's not fair.
[woman] Get him.
No!
Yeah!
-Do you yield? -Never.
Then you're a fool.
-We're brothers in the same cause. -Brothers?
You brought death to my people.
Memnon will follow you. He will come for his sorceress.
Yes, I know who she is.
And Memnon will stop at nothing till she's returned.
He'll come swifter and deadlier once he has her.
Memnon will stop at nothing.
Hide here as long as you can, but believe me when I say he'll find you.
And if he isn't stopped, he'll sweep across this land and kill all of you.
And who's gonna stop him, Akkadian?
You? Will you stand alone before the fury of his armies?
Yes.
Push, push! That's it!
-A gentleman always lets a lady win. -You didn't.
Best two out of three?
Dates?
Oh, thank you.
[Memnon] Cassandra!
[Arpid] Yes, that's good fun!
I've had a vision.
Memnon will follow me here and destroy these people.
You know this?
The things I see are like shimmers in a pond.
Some are certain, and some remain shadows.
But I do know this.
Memnon will release his armies and ride straight through this place.
Memnon will die by my hand.
It seems the gods favor me tonight, Akkadian.
If you face Memnon, you'll die.
That is your destiny.
I make my own destiny.
I need your help.
[Arpid] You can't leave us here. [Philos] Mathayus, don't be so stubborn. Listen to reason.
[Philos] Mathayus, don't be so stubborn. Listen to reason. You can't go alone. You're going to get yourself killed.
Where do you think you're going with my horse?
To Gomorrah. Nothing we can say will stop him.
Without your sorceress?
She returned to save the lives of your people.
I won't let her face Memnon's wrath alone.
-Step aside. -[Balthazar] Akkadian,
you're riding to your death.
If I let you ride alone,
what glory will there be left for me?
So tonight we celebrate.
Eat and drink your fill
for tomorrow we ride into battle.
I would've captured him myself, but he ran like a coward.
He left his bow behind.
My lord.
There is something that is troubling our soldiers.
How distressing. Pray tell.
It's been said the sorceress is no longer by your side.
Soldiers will fall prey
to idle palace gossip.
You have my word, she's perfectly safe.
If the men are to fight, to die,
they may need more than that.
-Do you doubt my word? -It is not that, sire.
It's just she is a symbol from which the men derive courage.
-Symbols are most effective when seen. -[Cassandra] My lord.
I am here at your request.
Pardon my absence.
I was not well.
But our impending victory has lifted my spirit.
Is this sufficient to placate your men?
Tell them what you see, Sorceress.
I see a great victory.
Your enemies will reveal themselves to you.
Halt.
-What is in the cart? -"What is in the cart"?
Actually, it is a bit of a surprise.
A gift for tonight's festivities.
Prince Takmet's request.
Very nice.
Well, now. Let's see that pretty little face.
Now go to my chambers. We have things to discuss.
My sincerest apologies, my lord.
I understand.
You are fearful, weak.
The feast is over.
To bed, men, for tomorrow we conquer.
Fortify the palace guard.
[Arpid] Whoa.
[Mathayus] All right. That was the easy part.
-Everybody know what to do? -Cripple the guards.
-Ignite the powder. -And try not to get killed.
What are you doing here? You could get hurt.
So could you.
Stay in the wagon.
You watch yourself, Akkadian.
-No need for concern, miss. -Oh, he's gonna pay for that.
Seal the gates. Seal all the gates.
Though I'm relieved to see you unharmed,
I am somewhat surprised the Akkadian didn't kill you.
He was after you. I was merely a pawn.
But you escaped his grasp?
I'm not without my wiles.
Yes, I'm well aware of that. Bring them.
Tomorrow my victory is complete. -That is your vision? -As I said, I have seen it.
-That is your vision? -As I said, I have seen it.
Have you?
I sense a change in you.
You seem somehow
diminished.
I assure you. I am myself.
Good. A small demonstration shouldn't trouble you then.
A simple test.
Now go. Everyone leave.
Where am I going?
Stop.
It's over there.
Should be just there.
[Philos] Good man.
Well, well.
What do we have here?
One at a time.
Six urns, four cobras.
Now, let's see what you can see.
Excellent.
One empty pot left now.
Who dies first?
We're almost there.
You know what I see? Fear.
You have lost your power,
thrown it all away.
-What magic is this? -My magic.
I see your fate, hollow king.
And its time has come.
You wish to test magic against steel?
I've come for the woman and your head.
The assassin and the sorceress,
how romantic.
I'll bury you both together.
And here it is, the foundation stone.
-Hurry, we're running out of time. -I'm hurrying, I'm hurrying.
Fire in front, palace guard at your back.
Looks like I'll be keeping my head after all, Akkadian.
Kill the witch!
Mathayus!
For your father.
Die well, assassin.
It seems the gods favor me tonight, Akkadian.
Mathayus!
Hurry up and light it.
You hurry up and light it. This is your invention.
Follow me.
Ready! Weapons!
Charge!
So much for not getting killed.
Catch this.
-Hail to the king! -[soldiers] Hail, hail!
I knew it from the start.
-Hail! -Yeah!
Mathayus!
Stay here with us, Balthazar. There's much work to be done.
I have to look after my own people.
You're a king now, Akkadian, and a good one, I think.
Don't forget how you got here or the people you came from.
My people will live on through me.
Remember, there'll always be a place for you here.
-Live free. -Rule well.
Remember, Nubian eyes will be watching you, Scorpion King.
I see a time of great peace and prosperity ahead.
How is it you see this?
Don't the legends say you'll lose your powers if you...
Can you think of a better way to keep a king from taking advantage?
Well, neither could my ancestors.
And how long will this time of peace last?
Nothing lasts forever, my king.
Anything in here would be dead by now.
There she is,
the Indominus rex.
[sub pilot on radio] Specimen collected. Sent to the surface.
Roger that.
Air One, clear for takeoff. Begin tracking.
-[helicopter pilot] Copy that. -Go, go!
Tracking on.
[helicopter pilot] Land One, the asset is secure. We got what we came for.
We're coming back for you. Close the doors.
Marine One, I gotta close the gates. Get out of there.
Understood. We're heading out.
[Jack] Marine One, I need to close the gates. Confirm position.
Can you hear me? Are you out?
Marine One?
-Guys? -What is that?
[Jack] Marine One, I'm closing the gates.
Seriously, guys, I'm kind of exposed out here.
Marine One. Confirm you're out, Marine One.
Confirm position. Can you hear me, Marine One, where are you?
[man 1] Come on!
I can't reach them!
-[man 1] Come on! -What?
-[thunder crashes] -[growling] [man 1] Behind you!
What is going on? I can't hear you!
[Jack] No, no! Wait! Don't go! No!
Throw him the ladder.
[Jack] Come on! Bring it down!
Slow down! No, no, no!
Don't go!
Oh, God!
No, wait! No, no! No!
Oh, God, no!
God, no!
-[alarm blaring] -We're gonna stall!
Cut it now!
-[man 1] Give him a chance! -[helicopter pilot] We're gonna die here!
Come on! Come on!
No, no, no!
Oh, God!
I said cut it!
Don't do it! It's horrible!
I don't wanna die!
-Yeah! [laughing] -[roaring]
-Yeah! -Come on!
[man 2] DNA sample secured. Tell the boss we're coming back home.
[news anchor] Three years after the fall of Jurassic World,
the debate over Isla Nublar rages on.
The island's long-dormant volcano, reclassified as active,
has shown considerable unrest in recent months.
Geologists now predict an extinction-level event
will kill off the last living dinosaurs on the planet.
Since the disaster that shocked the world in 2015,
the Masrani Corporation has paid out more than 800 million in damages
to settle class-action lawsuits brought by survivors.
Activist groups have mobilized around the globe
in what has become the flashpoint animal rights issue of our time.
With an eruption expected at any moment,
the US Senate has convened a special committee
to answer a grave, moral question.
Do dinosaurs deserve the same protections given to other endangered species
or should they be left to die?
[Malcolm] I think that we should allow
our magnificent and glorious dinosaurs
to be taken out by the volcano.
[man] Murderer.
[Sherwood] Silence, please.
As deeply sad as that would be,
we altered the course of natural history.
This is a correction.
Are you suggesting the Almighty is taking matters in his own hands?
Senator, with all due respect, God's not part of the equation, no.
What I mean is that, in the last century,
we amassed landmark technological power
and we've consistently proven ourselves incapable of handling that power.
Eighty years ago, who could've predicted nuclear proliferation?
But then there it was. And now we've got genetic power,
so how long is it gonna take for that to spread around the globe
and what's gonna be done with it?
It ain't gonna stop with the de-extinction of the dinosaurs.
I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.
[sighs] I'm talking about man-made,
cataclysmic change.
What kind of change?
Change is like death.
You don't know what it looks like until you're standing at the gates.
[woman] Yes, absolutely!
[man] We would love to have a photo op with the senator.
As a matter of fact, I do have the dinosaurs' best interests in mind.
I'm a paleo-veterinarian.
[Delgado on phone] Is that a real thing?
That's a real thing.
No, I haven't seen one with my own eyes.
You know, not everyone can afford to spend their life savings...
[whispers] Claire.
Hello. Hello, um...
[whispers] Congresswoman Delgado.
Congresswoman Delgado.
I'm Claire. I'm the lead organizer here.
Of course, but if I could just get a moment of your time?
Great. Thank you. Um...
So, our mission here at the Dinosaur Protection Group
is to secure federal funding for a safe, natural...
That was, like, 40 seconds. You're getting better.
You gotta stop letting your mom shop for you.
You don't need to insult me every time someone pisses you off.
Dude, I'm a doctor, not a telemarketer.
What is your job again?
You plug in cords, right?
It's actually more important than it sounds.
-Can I ask you a question? -[Delgado] Go on.
-Do you have kids? -Two girls.
Okay. So, your kids,
an entire generation, has grown up in a world
where dinosaurs are living and breathing.
But soon, they're gonna have to watch them go extinct.
Or not.
If people like you make a difference.
Set up a meeting with my office after the hearing.
[sighs] Great.
[Zia] Yes!
[news anchor] We now go live to the Capitol...
-Claire, it's on. -[man] Hey, hey. Turn it up.
[news anchor] ...the US government will take preventative action  to protect the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar.
After thorough deliberations,
the committee has resolved not to recommend any legislative action
regarding the de-extinct creatures on Isla Nublar.
This is an act of God.
And while, of course, we feel great sympathy for these animals,
we cannot condone government involvement
on what amounts to a privately-owned venture.
They're all gonna die and no one cares.
[Franklin] We do.
Give me one second. Let's get back to work.
Okay, everyone, come on.
Hello? [sighs]
[woman on phone] May I speak with Ms. Dearing?
Yes, this is Claire Dearing.
Good morning, I'm calling from Mr. Benjamin Lockwood's estate.
Would you mind holding for a second?
Yes, of course I'll hold.
Ms. Dearing, you're early.
Would you like to step in?
Thank you.
I will inform Mr. Mills that you've arrived.
[Mills] John Alfred Hammond, the father of Jurassic Park.
But of course you knew that.
Hello, Claire. I'm Eli Mills. I work for Ben Lockwood.
We actually met once, seven, eight years ago,
-and you don't remember. -Of course I remember.
-Haven't you run his foundation since-- -Since college, yeah.
-You remember? -Yes.
-Wow. Cool. -[chuckles]
He wanted someone young and idealistic to spend his fortune
and I used to be both.
Follow me.
Let me give you a bit of history.
This is where it all began.
Before the island, Sorna, Jurassic Park, all of it.
Hammond and Lockwood built a custom lab in the sub-basement,
extracted the first DNA from amber right beneath our feet.
Oh, my goodness.
What they did here was a miracle.
I still believe that.
So do I, Claire.
So do I.
And I still believe it matters what happens to those animals.
There is something Mr. Lockwood would very much like you to do, Claire.
You can call it a favor for an old friend.
We have a piece of land.
A sanctuary protected by natural barriers,
fully self-sustaining.
A new home where the dinosaurs will be secure and free.
[Claire] You're gonna get them out?
You're gonna save them?
[Benjamin] No, Ms. Dearing.
I'm going to save us.
We could both use a touch of redemption, couldn't we?
Lovely to see you again.
And you, Mr. Lockwood.
[Benjamin] This was all John Hammond's dream.
To let these creatures live in peace.
So, we have created sanctuary.
No fences. No cages.
No tourists.
Just as Mother Nature intended.
John said it best.
"These creatures don't need our protection.
They need our absence."
When we were young, we both shared this passion,
John and I.
What fools we were,
trying to run before we'd learned to walk.
As all young men do, I suppose.
But we learned.
Unfortunately, in the end,
it drove us apart.
Life teaches us some very hard lessons,
doesn't it, Claire?
Yes.
-Sir Benjamin. -Hmm?
My bloody medicines.
Will you excuse me, Claire?
Of course.
[Benjamin] Eli here will help you with the details.
We will save them.
What a gift
for our children.
Thank you.
Iris?
Does he have children? I thought I saw... Was there a little girl?
Yeah, he has a grandchild.
His daughter died in a car accident.
That's awful.
Yeah, I know, but they're very close. Really close.
So, what do you need from me?
[Mills] There was a tracking system in place at your park.
Radio-frequency ID chips in each dinosaur.
-I remember. -Right.
So, if we could access that system,
our ability to locate and capture those animals safely
would increase tenfold.
We need your handprint to access the system,
but what I really need, Claire,
is you.
Moving endangered species isn't exactly legal,
but it's the right thing to do.
No one knows this park as well as you do
and we need that expertise.
-How many can you save? -Eleven species. For sure.
I mean, more if we can, but time is against us.
I'm afraid there is one animal in particular
that poses a real challenge for us.
-Blue. -I didn't know she had a name,
but Blue is potentially the second-most intelligent piece of life on this planet
and she's the last of her kind. She must be preserved.
She can pick up your scent a mile off. You'll never capture her.
Well, we thought you might know someone who could help.
Maybe you could convince him.
[Owen] ♪ Oh, Time ♪ ♪ She is a freight train chugging ♪
♪ Oh, stalling Time is, too ♪
♪ When the light At the end of the tunnel ♪
♪ Is growing small behind you ♪
Hey, Owen.
♪ I still love you in the morning ♪
Owen!
[Owen] Oh, boy.
Hi.
Back for more, huh?
Can I buy you a beer?
Did you bring them, or do we gotta, like, go somewhere?
-[music playing on speakers] -[Claire laughing]
Seriously?
I can't believe you think that you left me!
Replay the conversation in your head, all right?
You said, "You wanna go live in your van, like a bum?
Go ahead, Owen."
And I said, "Okay."
So, how is that you leaving me?
Because I left. I left you.
You left because I told you to.
And then, I left.
Because you didn't wanna live in a van on the side of the road.
-No. No, no, no. -Remember?
Because you wouldn't let me drive the damn van for five minutes.
I'm chivalrous. What can I do?
You are so stubborn.
Well, look at you now. You're saving the world.
I'm trying, at least.
You can't just run away from everything, Owen.
So, you're what...
Dating an accountant now?
An insurance actuary?
Your skin looks nice.
Dermatologist?
Owen...
-Does he check you for moles? -Stop.
A ventriloquist?
This is not why we're here, okay?
Yeah, I know why we're here.
Lockwood's little flunky called me.
Rescue op.
Save the dinosaurs from an island that's about to explode.
-What could go wrong? -I'm going.
-Don't. -I don't have a choice.
What? Of course you have a choice.
So, what, I should just build my own cabin,
play pool, and drink beer all day
while these dinosaurs go extinct?
Yeah. I like pool.
Blue is alive.
Jesus, Claire!
You raised her, Owen.
You spent years of your life working with her.
You're just gonna let her die?
Well, yeah.
Come on, you're a better man than you think you are.
You should write fortune cookies.
Forget it...
There's a charter flight leaving tomorrow morning.
You're on the manifest. I just wanted to let you know.
[Owen on video] All right, chow time, chow time.
Back up. Back off.
Hey, hey, hey. Jeez.
Take it easy. Echo.
Jeez, there's plenty of food.
God, you guys been eating sugar or something?
You're hyper today.
Okay, okay. Back up.
Thank you, Blue.
Did you get that?
Relax. You're more likely to die riding on a horse than in a plane.
No, I'm not, because I won't get on a horse.
My chances are zero.
[Zia] Planes are the safest way to travel.
[Franklin] You call this a plane? My cousin has a drone bigger than this.
-[clears throat] -Owen!
[Zia] Franklin, you wiener, get on the plane.
Didn't think you were gonna ever show up.
This is Zia Rodriguez. Zia.
-Hey, how you doing? -Yeah, real good. How are you?
Good.
Franklin Webb. Systems analyst.
Nervous flyer?
Would you ride a thousand-pound horse that's been abused all its life?
I rode my motorcycle through the jungle with a pack of raptors.
We're not compatible.
[Iris] Maisie?
You're always hiding from me. This is not my job, looking for you.
Maisie!
Maisie!
Come out!
Boo!
-You silly sausage. -[laughing]
You'll be the death of me.
You know, one day, my heart might really stop.
Then what would you do?
Go and live in the forest with the lions?
There are no lions in the forest.
Your grandfather's been asking for you.
-Really? -Mmm.
So, you go see your grandfather, and then you go straight to your bath.
-I don't want a bath. -What?
Queen's English, girl.
-[in British accent] Bath. -Bath. -Bath. -Bath.
Bath, not "bath," you're not a wild animal.
-[roars] -[yelps] Stop.
-[knock on door] -[door opens]
Hi, Grandpa. Ah, there you are.
Come over and sit by me.
I've missed you.
I was on safari
all the way through the Cretaceous to the Jurassic in one day.
Oh, my. What'd you see?
Mostly herbivores. There was one T. rex, though.
Casualties, of course. Iris included.
She jumped out of her skin.
[chuckling] You have your mother's wicked sense of humor.
Do I look like her?
Oh, yes.
You could be her mirror image.
Did my mother ever visit the park?
Once, a long time ago.
She would've saved them, too, you know.
She would have saved them all.
[man] That's two klicks past the LZ.
[Wheatley] Claire.
Ken Wheatley. Welcome back.
Quite an operation you've got going on here.
Mr. Lockwood takes his humanitarian efforts very seriously. Where's the, uh, raptor wrangler?
Where's the, uh, raptor wrangler?
Animal behaviorist.
-Owen Grady. -Hey, Owen. Ken Wheatley.
And you are the Great White Hunter?
I guess. I'm the expedition facilitator.
Oh, God! It's hot.
It's about to get a whole lot hotter.
[man] Keep it moving! You're all clear!
Go! Go! You've got the green light!
This way! Let's go! Let's go! Keep it moving!
Hold it! Hold up!
Need some bug spray?
Bug spray?
The T. rex would be dead by now, right?
[Zia] No, it's impossible to know the max lifespan
of a clone in a completely different environment.
Take a caveman that would've lived 20 years.
Feed him prime meals, give him health care,
he's gonna live five times as long.
So, she'd be dead by now? Right?
[Wheatley] Bad memories?
Some were good.
What was that?
Is it the T. rex?
I have to see this.
Hey! Miss? Miss!
This area is not secured.
[Zia] Look at that.
Never thought I'd see one in real life.
She's beautiful.
Can we...
Okay, let's go.
[Franklin] Okay. Okay.
-Okay, main system... -[computer beeping]
And turn on the controls.
It should be working.
[Wheatley] Come on, tiger. -Do you know what you're doing? -[beeping]
After you, tiger.
[Zia] Are we sure these biometric chips are still transmitting?
Battery would be dead by now.
[Claire] The dinosaur is the battery. They're powered by body heat and movement.
They're powered by body heat and movement. [snaps fingers] Hand.
[snaps fingers] Hand.
How much longer until...
[Franklin] I'm in.
There's a large concentration on the east dock.
That's our boat. We've already captured a bunch of them.
Without the tracking system?
The big herbivores are easy to find.
Can you isolate that raptor?
-I need a species code. -D-9.
There she is.
I'm gonna need to borrow your truck.
I'm coming with you.
We don't know what kind of condition she might be in.
Miss, things could get hairy out there.
These are powerful sedatives.
One too many, and she could have respiratory failure.
Also, I'm not as soft and witless as your comment implies.
Let's go, beefcake.
Oh, Owen?
Be careful, okay?
If I don't make it back,
remember, you're the one who made me come.
I'll be all right.
[Owen] We're not going to get any closer to her in this thing.
-We should stop here. -Hold up.
Load out, look alive, stay alive.
-We got your back, brother. -Yeah.
[Owen on radio] Claire, I'm going to have to track her alone.
I'll need you to be my eyes if she runs. Copy?
Copy that.
Wheatley, I'm on fresh sign. Wait for my signal.
There you are.
Hey, girl, you miss me?
Easy. Hey!
-[hissing] -Hey.
I brought you something.
Here you go.
That's right.
Okay.
-Hey! -[clicker clicking]
You know me.
-[clicker clicking] -Eyes on me.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
You know me.
That's right.
That's right.
Hold your... [grunts]
I told you to wait for my signal. -[guns cocking] -[screeching]
Back your men up right now. [panting]
No, wait! No, no! No, don't shoot her!
Wheatley, you son of a bitch!
Owen!
What are you doing?
Owen!
You shoot me
and that animal dies.
I think we have the drop on you, sweetheart.
She's losing blood. And if I don't treat her,
she'll never make it back to camp.
How about this?
That animal dies, I shoot you.
You're gonna take care of her.
Let's move out!
[man] Cut the cord and let's go! Let's get out of here!
No, no, no! Wait!
Wait, are they protecting us? What's going on?
I don't think so. -[distant explosion] -[Franklin yells]
Why am I here?
[Wheatley] Hey, Mills, we got her done. Mission accomplished.
[laughing] Just in the nick of time.
Wheatley, what the hell is going on there? We're a day behind schedule already.
[Wheatley] I want that money in the bank by the time I get back, all right?
Okay, good. Listen to me. No more delays, okay?
-If we don't get those animals-- -Mr. Mills?
Not now, Maisie. Thank you. If we don't get
-those animals-- -Mr. Mills, are the dinosaurs safe?
I said not now!
[Wheatley] Mills? Mills?
I'm sorry, honey. This is an important call.
If you go up to the library, I'll meet you up there in a few minutes.
-Okay. -Okay.
I'll tell you all about it, I promise.
-Okay. -Okay.
Wheatley, you get those animals here now!
I want that bonus. We got the blue one.
[Mills] Bring her to me first!
[Wheatley] All right.
Hello, can anyone hear me?
Hello?
Hello, is anybody there?
-Can anybody copy? -[beeping]
I'm... I'm trying everything. It's jammed.
"Just take the job, son, build your people skills."
Yeah, thanks, Dad.
-That's it. -[door opens]
Proximity alert.
Something's coming.
Where does that tunnel lead?
Well, it connects to the rest of the--
Park.
[Franklin] It's the T. rex, it's the T. rex! Claire, it's the T. rex.
It's the T. rex, it's the T. rex. Will you stop? It's not the T. rex!
[sighs] Probably.
"Probably"?
Lava! Lava! Lava! Lava!
Deep breaths, Franklin.
See? Not a T. rex!
How is this better?
Claire, what do we do? What do we do?
It's stuck!
Chair!
[Claire] Come on! Let's go!
Come on, Franklin!
We made it! Yeah!
-[Franklin] Come on, come on, come on! -[roaring]
Yes, yes, go, go!
Go, go!
Claire!
Holy...
[Owen] Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Oh, my God!
[Owen] Go! Go!
-[Claire] Buckle up. -It's okay.
Get in!
Owen!
[Claire] We gotta get out.
[Franklin] We just fell from the cliff. We're alive.
We're alive!
Franklin, move!
No, no, no!
No. Claire, we're gonna sink! Water's leaking!
[Claire gasps] Oh, God. We need to get out!
Franklin, watch out!
[screams] I wanna go home!
Owen. Owen!
[Franklin] Owen?
[Claire] Owen. Okay.
Move! Move!
No! No, no, no!
Push!
Owen! No.
[Franklin] Where's he going?
[Claire] Okay, don't panic. Don't panic.
[Franklin] We're running out of air. We're not gonna make it.
We are. We are. Take a deep breath.
Where is Zia?
[Owen] It was a double-cross. They took her, she must be with Blue.
Hey! Can you still track them?
Not anymore.
It was a lie.
It was a lie. Bastards!
It was all a lie!
Not all of it.
[Wheatley] Let's move it! Move! Move!
Anything of value, I want on that boat!
-How you doing? -[man 1] The bolt won't give!
Well, just button it up, and we'll tow it on! Let's go!
-[roaring] -[man 2] Lock it up! Move it out!
-[man 3] Come on, now. -[roaring]
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hang on! Wait up!
Stop that truck! Stop it!
Hey, sweetheart. Hello, hello.
Beautiful.
You're gonna feel that when you wake up.
[Zia] Hey, put your weapon down!
You got the barrel pointed right at her head!
[Owen] They have Zia. They're loading out.
If they already had the dinosaurs, why did they need us?
They needed the tracking system to capture Blue.
[Owen] There she is. She don't look good.
We need to get on that boat.
The rock's good. We're safe on the rock.
It's the boat or the lava, Franklin.
All right, boat's good. I'm all about the boat.
Go, go, get on the boat!
Get on the boat, now! Go, go!
-[man 1] Move it, move it! -[man 2] Go, go, go!
[Owen] Get that truck!
-Franklin! -Hey, get that truck going!
Okay.
-You okay? -Am I dead?
Not yet, kid.
Come on!
Come on. Give me your hand! Reach!
Come on, reach!
Hold on!
[Iris] Mr. Mills?
Your visitor's waiting.
[Mills] Mr. Eversoll.
It's a pleasure to meet you in person after all this time. How are you?
-Excuse me. -Yeah?
-Where are the dinosaurs? -The dinosaurs are, uh, are en route.
Oh, so, am I supposed to sell these ones?
You don't need to worry, okay? They will be here soon.
I don't really work with amateurs,
so I'm gonna contact my buyers and call this off.
They will be here tomorrow, and your buyers won't be disappointed.
-[cell phone dialing] -Trust me, whatever their interest,
agricultural, industrial, sport hunting,
we will have something to suit them.
Eleven species,
each with unique biopharmaceutical properties.
I estimate four million per species.
Four million is a slow Tuesday where I'm from.
You're wasting my time.
You ever made 100 million on a Tuesday? -[laughing] -Huh?
All this is in the past.
I wanna talk to you about the future.
I'll give you ten minutes.
The whole point of selling the Isla Nublar dinosaurs
is to finance our future operations here.
It's, uh, seed money.
Call it an overture to something much more ambitious.
[Eversoll] Yeah, and more lucrative, I guess.
[Mills] Right, we've reactivated the old facilities,
updated the technology,
and imported the best geneticists from around the world.
This operation has been many years in the planning.
Genetic power is an uncharted frontier.
The potential for growth is more than you can fathom.
This way, please.
If the entire run of our sorry history
has taught us one irrevocable lesson,
it's that man is inevitably drawn to war
and is willing to use any means necessary to win it.
You're gonna weaponize them?
We've been using animals in combat for centuries.
Horses, elephants.
The Soviets used disease-bearing rats
against the Germans at Stalingrad.
Yes, yes.
Our geneticists have created
a direct descendant of Henry Wu's masterpiece,
the animal that took down Jurassic World.
Indominus rex.
Her DNA, retrieved from the island way before its destruction,
forms the architecture of a completely new creature.
Every bone and muscle designed for hunting and killing.
And thanks to Owen Grady's research,
it follows human command.
We call it the Indoraptor.
[Maisie whispers] Grandpa?
Grandpa?
-[grunts softly] -[gasps] Grandpa.
Maisie, what are you doing up?
There was a man here today with Mr. Mills.
It was probably just some business about the sanctuary. That's all.
I heard them talking.
They're going to sell the dinosaurs.
-They're bringing them here. -Oh. Huh.
I'm sure you misunderstood.
I know what I heard, Grandpa.
Maisie, it's way past your bedtime.
Let's talk about this in the morning.
-But-- -Maisie,
I'll find out tomorrow.
Go to bed.
Good night.
Good night, my heart.
-[dinosaur roars] -[gasps] Jesus.
It's okay, Blue, just a little longer.
Oh, my God! You guys are alive!
[Owen] Oh, look what they've done to her.
Who are these assholes?
Animal traffickers. Look how they're treating them.
They're not gonna take them to a sanctuary, they're gonna sell them.
Not Blue, they need her for something else.
Like what?
I don't know, but she's... She's hemorrhaging, and I don't have instruments
She's hemorrhaging, and I don't have instruments
and they want to keep her alive.
Hey.
-You're all right, you're all right. -[Zia] Claire, come here.
Come on. Put your hand here.
Steady pressure.
-[screeches] -Hey, hey, hey.
Watch out. I can't take the bullet out without a transfusion from another animal.
I can't take the bullet out without a transfusion from another animal.
Which one of you knows how to find a vein?
Oh! I did a blood drive for the Red Cross.
Great. Okay.
Franklin, take over for Claire.
No, no, no.
Franklin, now!
-Steady pressure. -[Blue groaning]
[grunts] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Is it in my mouth? -Did it get in my mouth? -Mmm-mmm.
-You sure? -You're good.
[Franklin] I can feel it on my face. All of the animals should be sedated.
Look for any kind of Tetanuran,
their blood type should be close enough.
Look for carnivores with two or three fingers. No more than three.
I think there's one onboard.
You gotta be kidding me.
She's tranqued.
Okay, okay. Okay, I got it. Come on.
Okay. [exhales]
Oh, no. Are you okay?
[strained] I'm okay.
Come on.
-You're gonna have to do it. -I can't.
The skin is too thick.
I have to use both my hands to put pressure on the vein.
You gotta do it.
I... I can't... I can't reach.
You're gonna have to climb up there.
No, no. I'm not gonna climb up there.
You'll be okay. It's like riding a bull.
"Riding a bull"? I didn't grow up in a rodeo
-or wherever you came from. -She's asleep now.
I can't say that she's gonna be asleep a minute from now, so get up.
Okay, fine.
Oh, my God, she stinks.
-[grunts] -Gently. Gently.
No, no, no.
Good job.
You're making this look totally normal.
You're gonna have to jam it in there, it's really thick skin.
-Ready? -Yeah.
-Okay. One, two... -One, two...
-Stab! -[snarls]
Owen!
It's working.
[man 1] The pee is silent.
[man 2] That door is open.
[man 3] I got it.
[Claire] The bars! The bars, Owen.
Owen, I can get through there. Come on.
Jump, Owen!
[Claire] Owen, jump. Now!
Did you see that?
Please tell me you got the blood.
[Owen] This is Delta. She's one of the holdover theropods,
one of the survivors from the second group.
Now, watch this.
I show any sign of weakness whatsoever...
See that?
Day 176. Blue is showing unprecedented levels of compliance.
Here I am with Blue.
She's a theropod from the new group.
I show signs of weakness...
Hey.
I'm okay.
She's pretty extraordinary.
[Owen] Blue, displaying levels
of interest, concern,
hyper-intelligence,
cognitive bonding.
See that?
She's tilting her head, she's craning forward.
Increased eye movement. She's curious.
She's showing empathy.
[Zia] Okay, I'm gonna make an incision in her leg to remove the bullet.
It's a lot of muscle tissue.
She's gonna be okay.
[Owen] Blue is the key.
That's it. You have Blue,
-you get these raptors to do anything. -[door opens]
[man] You're sure she'll live?
If it dies, we have blood samples.
[man] No, no, no. That's not good enough.
The raptor is a behavioral specimen. We need her in good health.
I didn't shoot the damn thing. What do you want me to do, huh?
You don't have the faintest comprehension of what I'm doing here.
Do you understand the complexity of creating an entirely new life form?
No, but I understand the complexity of paying for it, okay?
All your money will have been wasted if I don't get Blue here in good health.
To get the next iteration under control,
it needs to form a familial bond with a closely related genetic link.
-English, Henry. -It needs a mother!
Blue's DNA will be part of the next Indoraptor's makeup.
So, it will be genetically coded to recognize her authority
and assume her traits.
Empathy. Obedience.
Everything the prototype you have now is missing.
-Okay, so how long is this gonna take? -[scoffs]
It's not a sprint, Mr. Mills. It's a marathon.
A marathon sounds expensive.
Besides, time is running out, and so is my patience, Henry.
[Dr. Wu] You have to understand,
this is all uncharted territory.
A wolf, genetically,
is barely distinguishable from a bulldog,
but within that gray area
is art.
[Mills groans] Spare me the poetry, Henry.
Can you do it? Can you do it?
[Dr. Wu] Yes, I can do it.
[Mills] Well, then do it.
[Dr. Wu] Thank you.
[Mills] God, you're a pain in the ass.
Hey. Hey! Maisie!
What is that? What is it?
Keep her in there and keep the door locked.
You want to keep her locked in?
That's exactly what I want.
Sir Benjamin needs to see you now.
I believe it's important.
[man on PA] All crew, prepare for docking.
All crew, prepare for docking.
[man 1] Let's move it, boys.
[Wheatley] Jeez! Will somebody shut that thing up? It sounds like my ex-wife.
We're here.
-Where? -[door opens]
[Wheatley] Just get in your truck and let's go.
-[Owen] Move. Move! -Move, move, move!
You got a heartbeat?
Yeah. Do you?
I need blood samples.
I'm not here to help you reset the food chain,
so take your own damn samples.
What a nasty woman.
-[bell rings] -Go, go, now, now. Go.
[man on PA] Attention, all crew. Attention, all crew.
Drivers, get to your vehicles.
Hey!
-What the hell is going on? -I was...
I needed an extra pair of hands. He volunteered.
-Are you deck crew? -Aye, aye.
We're loading out. Follow me.
Uh, does that mean we're leaving the ship right now?
That is what "loading out" means. Now get moving. Come on, follow me.
-Come on, kid. There's lots to do. -Shit!
-[Claire] Oh, no. He's not gonna make it. -Get a move on. Come on.
-Move it! Come on. Move! -[Claire] We have to help him.
Stay here, I'll get him.
There's no time. Let's go.
[man 3] Good to go!
[man 4] Roll out!
Where are they taking them?
-We're about to find out. -[man 5] Let's go!
Ready to roll!
[man 6] Keep it coming!
[man 7] Move it out! Keep it rolling!
[Wheatley] Good to go!
[Zia] Come on, girl.
Yes!
This is Lockwood's estate.
He must have one big-ass garage.
[man 1] Let's go! We want this offloaded in ten mikes!
[man 2] Big door's open.
[Benjamin] Did you really think you could get away with it?
In my own house.
You entrusted me
to guide your fortune into the future.
-I have done that. -Damn you!
Pick up that phone.
I want you to call the police.
It'll be easier if the story comes from you.
As you say, sir.
You know, I've been thinking, John Hammond was right.
It was an unholy thing that you did.
I'm not the only guilty one here, am I, sir?
Hey.
We hit that town, we call the cavalry, shut this down.
Whoo. Hello.
You should have stayed on the island.
Better odds.
[Mills] Hi, Claire.
I just wanted to come and apologize.
I didn't wanna bring you into any of this,
but it was the only way that we could get the raptor.
We needed it. Come on.
So, what? This is it?
I mean, you're a smart guy, you could have
started a foundation, cured cancer,
but instead you,
what?
Sell endangered species?
I saved these animals.
You betrayed a dying man for money.
Claire, I admire your idealism,
but we both exploited these animals.
At least I have the integrity to admit it.
I never, ever did anything remotely illegal.
You authorized the creation of the Indominus rex.
You exploited a living thing in a cage for money.
How is that different? Huh?
And you, the man who proved raptors can follow orders.
You never thought about the applications of your research, Owen?
How many millions a trained predator might be worth?
You two,
you're the parents of the new world.
-[groans] -Hey! Let him go.
-Owen. -I think I'll break it.
Let him go.
-Claire, I just want-- [groans] -[clang]
Say, how we gonna end this?
Well, as far as everybody else is concerned, they burned up on the island.
[man 1 on radio] Buyers on approach. Looks like a full house.
[man 2] Roger that.
-[Eversoll] Good evening. -[Mills] Good evening.
-Welcome, gentlemen. -[Eversoll] Good evening.
[Mills] Welcome.
[Eversoll] And these guys are development rep for Aldaris Pharmaceuticals.
[Mills] Great.
And the guy in the beard is a proxy for Gregor Adlrich,
a Slovenian arms dealer.
Equine buyers.
Rand Magnus, an oil magnate from Houston.
[Mills] What's their interest?
[Eversoll] Strictly personal.
His kid wants a baby Triceratops.
Glenn, how's Janet?
[Glenn] She's doing fine, thanks.
[Eversoll chuckles] Straight ahead, Glenn.
[in English] Well, he only wants carnivores. Two of them.
Looks like Lockwood's gonna have a very good night.
Will he be joining us?
[Mills] Um... That's very unlikely.
[whispers] Grandpa?
Grandpa?
Grandpa, wake up.
Grandpa.
[sobbing] Grandpa, wake up. Wake up.
-[monitor flatlining] -[Mills] Iris!
Iris!
It's over.
What a tragedy.
I suppose now he's gone,
you'll be looking for another situation.
No.
Maisie needs me.
[Mills] I'm her guardian now.
What she needs is no longer your concern.
[Iris] You don't understand her the way I do.
[Mills] I understand her value.
But I raised her.
-I raised both of them. -[gasps softly]
-Please, Mr. Mills. -[Mills] Goodbye, Iris.
Do you remember the first time you saw a dinosaur?
First time you see them, it's like
a miracle.
You read about them in books, you see the bones in museums,
but you don't really believe it.
They're like myths.
And then you see
that first one alive.
This is not your fault.
But it is.
No.
This one's on me.
I showed them the way.
Listen.
You and I are gonna have plenty of time to talk about this later.
If there is a later.
Yes, there is.
I got a cabin to finish.
[Claire] What is that?
Well, look who just woke up.
We're getting out of here.
Welcome, ladies, gentlemen,
to this extraordinary evening.
Let's dive right in
with lot number one,
the Ankylosaurus.
She's a herbivorous quadruped,
late Cretaceous.
This is one of the largest armored dinosaurs,
known by paleontologists as a living tank.
What are you doing?
Escaping.
You sure about this?
Nope.
I have $4 million, anyone five?
-[buyer 1] Five. -$5 million.
$5 million. Do I hear six?
-[buyer 2] $6 million. -[Eversoll] $6 million, thank you.
Any increase on six? Seven. $7 million.
-[buyer 3] Eight million. -$8 million.
Nine million on the phones. Do I hear 10 million?
-Ten million? Ten million. -Ten.
$10 million! Once, twice...
Sold!
To the gentleman from Indonesia. Congratulations, sir.
Lot number two, ladies and gentlemen.
A juvenile Allosaurus.
[chuckles] A fierce and an aggressive predator.
-[whistles] -[growls] Sold!
Sold!
Sold.
Wonderful.
-Wonderful bidding. -[roars]
[man 1] Come on. You're good. Let's go.
-[man 2] Move it out. -[man 3] Here we go.
[man 4] Bring it on back. Let's go.
[Claire] Okay.
Hey! Hey, you. Look at me! Look at me!
Hey!
Come with me. Come with me!
Okay, there you go.
You're welcome.
[Claire] Hey, wait!
Please, please wait.
[whispering] That's Lockwood's granddaughter.
Hey. Hey, kid. You wanna come down out of there?
Do you remember me?
Yeah?
My name is Claire. What's yours?
Maisie.
Maisie Lockwood.
Oh, Maisie.
This is my friend, Owen.
I saw you
with the Velociraptors. Blue.
Oh. Oh, yeah?
You like dinosaurs?
So do I.
Tell you what, you come on down from there,
I'll tell you everything you need to know about Blue.
That sound all right?
All right, yeah.
Come on down.
[Claire] Sweetie,
we need some help finding your grandfather.
Can you take us to him?
[sniffles] No.
You made it down here all by yourself, huh?
Brave kid.
Looks like you could use a friend.
He's gone.
Listen, I'll tell you what,
we were just about to go and find our friends
and then get the heck out of here.
You wanna come with us?
[Claire] We could use a friend, too.
-[buyer in distance] 19.5! -[Eversoll in distance] 19.5. Do I hear 20?
Do I hear 20? Twenty? Thank you. Thank you.
Twenty. Do I hear...
$21 million!
21 million...
-[gavel bangs] -Sold!
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
that we are halfway through the evening...
...we'd like to offer a special treat to our
discriminating buyers.
This evening we will preview
a new asset that we've been developing.
A creature of the future
made from pieces of the past.
Ladies and gentlemen, please be warned,
this is the perfect blend of the two most dangerous creatures
that have ever walked the earth.
We call it the Indoraptor.
The perfect weapon for the modern age. Built for combat.
With tactical responses more acute than any human soldier.
What is that thing?
[Maisie] They made it.
Mr. Mills and the other man.
What man?
[Maisie] Him.
[Eversoll] Designed by Mr. Henry Wu
with an intelligence quotient comparable to the Velociraptor.
Biospecs include a heightened sense of smell
and trained to respond to a pulse-coded laser targeting system,
enabling it to isolate and track prey
in complex environments. Voilà.
Now, first, the laser sets the target.
[Eversoll] Once locked on,
the acoustic signal triggers the attack.
This animal is relentless.
Now, modifications are still being made...
Twenty million!
[Eversoll] No, this is a prototype.
Uh, not for sale.
Twenty-one!
-Well, it is still a prototype, but... -[buyer 1] Twenty-two!
[buyer 2] Twenty-three!
[buyer 3] Twenty-four!
$24 million.
Twenty-five million!
Do I hear 26?
[Owen] That thing can't leave this building.
[buyer 4] Twenty-six!
-Any advance on 26? -[buyer 5] Twenty-seven!
$27 million from the back.
What are you doing? This animal is not for sale.
If you wanna create an addict, you have to give them a taste.
He's a prototype.
This prototype is worth $28 million right now.
Relax, we'll make some more.
So will they.
Hey, buddy.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
[Eversoll] Once. Twice.
-Sold to the Russian friend. -[all applauding]
Well done, sir. And congratulations...
-[elevator bell dings] -...for this magnificent animal.
[man] Oh, God!
Get this thing out of here!
[man] Hey, you! Turn it out!
[Wheatley] Mills!
Mills, where are you?
I want my bonus!
Holy cow!
What are you?
I didn't see you on the island.
Oh, you're a tough guy.
Look at you.
You're some kind of hot rod with really pretty teeth.
This'll make a perfect centerpiece for my necklace.
Open wide.
No. No.
Please. [sobbing]
Move! Move! Out of the way!
-[Mills] Don't! -[guns cocking]
You two, you deserve each other.
Maisie, come with me.
You got your money, now walk away.
Oh, what are you gonna do, huh?
We're gonna stop this. All of it.
How?
What, are you gonna go back in time before Hammond decided to play God?
You can't put it back in the box!
-We have to try. -It's too late.
Maisie, come.
Oh! So, you're gonna take care of her now?
You have no idea what she is.
What do you think drove Hammond and Lockwood apart, huh?
Lockwood never had a grandchild.
He just wanted his daughter back.
And he had the technology.
He created another.
He made her again. -[men groan] -[roars]
Go.
-Come on! -[breathing shakily]
Come on.
[man] Eggs need to go in a sterile environment.
Where are those genome kits?
Get this to Mills. Be very careful, it's extremely valuable.
You, I need blood samples from the raptor.
Don't just stand there like an idiot!
Get me 50 ccs carfentanil and a phlebotomy kit!
It's right there! Now!
Come on. Come on.
I need this raptor's blood. -[roars] -[yelps]
Sure, go ahead.
Where is that kit?
Okay, now listen to me.
It is better for you to cooperate.
I'm gonna get this blood
with or without your help.
This blood's contaminated.
I designed this animal myself.
It's pure.
Every cell of her body was created in the most controlled environment
under the most demanding of conditions.
Yeah, but I did an intravenous blood transfusion with a T. rex,
so, it's a sock drawer in there.
You what?
-[grunts] -[Zia] Franklin! What are you doing?
Saving your life!
Yes!
[man] Stop!
-Don't move. -[electricity crackling]
Now step away from that cage. Now.
-[roars] -Easy now.
Run. Run!
[man on radio] Dave, do you copy? Dave, you there?
Run!
[exhales] You see that?
[Zia] That's hydrogen cyanide.
If it reaches the containment level, it'll kill them all.
The ventilation system is down.
Can you bring it back up?
[Franklin sighs] The server's unresponsive. I have to reboot the whole system.
-So, reboot it. -I'm trying.
What?
-Franklin, we don't have time. -I know, I know, I know.
Okay.
Go. Go.
Run, run. [screams]
-[Claire breathing heavily] -Hey. Here. You're okay.
Put pressure on it. Don't look at it.
Look at me. Look at me.
You have to go find her.
I can't leave you here.
Go. Go, I'll be fine.
Run!
Maisie, stay down!
[Maisie] Follow me. I know a way on the other side.
Come on.
Come on!
This way!
I got you.
Hey!
Come on.
[Zia] What the hell?
[Owen] Hey!
[Franklin] Hey!
You good?
Yeah. You?
Nope.
Hey, we got a problem downstairs.
I need you to come see this.
They're all dying.
The blast damaged the ventilation system.
We did everything we could.
I can open the gates from here.
Claire, be careful.
We're not on an island anymore.
[Owen] Claire.
You press that button, there is no going back.
We can't let them die.
I had to.
They're alive,
like me.
[man] Don't! Don't!
[Owen] Hey, girl.
[Claire] Owen. Shh!
It's okay, she won't hurt us.
Hey.
Blue, come with me.
We'll take you to a safe place, okay?
[Malcolm] How many times do you have to see the evidence?
How many times must the point be made?
We're causing our own extinction.
Too many red lines have been crossed.
And our home has, in fundamental ways, been polluted
by avarice and political megalomania.
Genetic power has now been unleashed
and of course, that's gonna be catastrophic.
This change was inevitable
from the moment we brought the first dinosaur back from extinction.
We convince ourselves that sudden change
is something that happens outside the normal order of things,
like a car crash,
or that it's beyond our control, like a fatal illness.
We don't conceive of sudden, radical, irrational change
as woven into the very fabric of existence.
Yet, I can assure you, it most assuredly is.
And it's happening now.
Humans and dinosaurs are now gonna be forced to coexist.
These creatures were here before us.
And if we're not careful, they're gonna be here after.
We're gonna have to adjust to new threats that we can't imagine.

Doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.
You cling to the old ways like a tick on a dog's ass.
And look at where that's gotten us.
You've made your point.
I accept your terms.
I think we're a little beyond that now, don't you?
[Sasha] I made a mistake.

Oh shit!
[teacher] I'm calling because your husband is late again picking up Paige.
Do you have an ETA of when we should expect him?
All right, but this is the third time this week that he's late.
I shouldn't have to remind you that…
[Bud] Paige!
-[Paige] Hey, Daddy! -Come on, baby!
Well, what up?
-Who's your favorite daddy? -[chuckles] You.
I'm your only daddy, I hope. What's up?
-You're late, you know? -What?
-Are you serious? -[Paige] Yeah.
You know why I'm late? 'Cause this job.
-Work is dumb. -Oh, well, yes, it is.
And what do you have in your hand? Oh…
-A little something. -[Bud] Shaboom! I love that.
-How about this? Hmm? -[kisses]
-All right. -Can we go to Yogurtworld?
Yogurtworld. Oh, Pickle, I don't know.
Your mom is already upset because we're late.
[tongue clicks] Whose fault is that?
Harsh.
But true. Roll the dice.
-And we gonna roll out. Here we go. -[engine starts]
Hands in the air!
We taking off.
Yogurtworld, we're on the way.
[Paige] Yogurtworld!
[Bud] I'm gonna get strawberry. There it is.
[chuckling] Daddy's getting… strawberry.
Pow.
Boom! Got it.
-Boom! -Yeah. Boom.
Got it.
Got it.
You got it.
You're so weird.
If you only knew. All right, come on.
Excuse me, do you guys have any Black History Month discounts?
Home sweet home.
[both] Home sweet…
-We home! -We home!
You're late.
-Hey. -[woman] Hi.
We went to Yogurtworld.
Oh! Did you?
Snitches get stitches. We were gonna keep that between us.
[whispers] Sorry.
It's all good. Gimme five on your way up.
-Whoo! -Nothing can stop you. All the way up.
Making a ten-year-old a part of your lies now. Charming.
She told me that she liked hanging out with her old man. I was like…
Oh, she wanted to hang out with you.
See, that's something she coulda done if you'd taken her to school like I asked.
Well, I told you I had to go, and--
That pool cleaning appointment this morning?
-Exactly. -Right.
Whose house was it?
It was Mrs… uh… Mrs. Jones' house.
Where's she live?
She, uh… With Mr. Jones. That's exactly…
-Right over there on Mr. Jones Way. -Oh my God. Bud.
We'd get much further if you'd be straight with me.
-I am being straight. -You're not.
I am being straight, but the question is, what is that sponge doing on the ground?
I am being straight, but the question is, what is that sponge doing on the ground? And this? What is all this?
And this? What is all this?
I am fixing the broken tile.
Mm-hmm. I see that. And why?
Uh, what does it matter?
-You don't live here anymore. -Wow, that's what we doing?
What I was gonna tell you is that this tile goes…
Joss, what's this? This a new door?
A door with five locks doesn't exactly
send the right impression to potential buyers.
Buyers? Buyers? What are you talking about, Joss?
I didn't want to tell you this way, but…
I'm thinking about selling the house and taking my mom up on her offer.
You and your momma.
Florida?
What are you talking about? You can't move to Florida.
All her friends are here. I'm here. Her world is here.
She needs stability.
She has stability. She got you. She got me.
She got Yogurtworld. Ain't no Yogurtworld in Florida!
Yeah, and she also has a school
that she's not gonna be able to go to unless we pay tuition by Monday.
Then let's pay the tu… Mon--
Monday? Monday, like in seven days?
Yeah, which you would know if you had checked your voice mails.
Is that the stability you talk about?
-How much is it? -Five grand.
Five thousand dollars for a child?
Mm-hmm. And she needs braces.
-What's wrong? -Her teeth are jacked up.
She always says she likes her teeth 'cause they look like my teeth.
That's my point.
Okay. Well, how much are braces? What? Five, six hundred dollars?
-Without insurance, try six grand. -Six grand?
But I did find a guy who quoted me $4,800.
-I know we done been through a whole lot. -Yeah.
Just, please, don't take my daughter away.
Till Monday. Just give me till Monday.
Ten grand. Tuition, teeth, everything.
Okay, fine. I will give you till Monday.
Come on, hug me.
-Hug me. -I'm hugging you.
-Stop listening to your mom. She drinks. -What?
-Uh, Bud. -What?
I have one more question.
Paige said that there's a porn star living in your building?
How does she even know what a porn star is?
It's the Valley, Joss. They live amongst us.
♪ Still gotta pray for the LA, we play Black folks still bring into the true ♪
Fellas. 'Sup, baby?
Who's thirsty? Hmm?
Business is booming, I see.
What's up, Eddie? Oh!
You always fast.
[in Korean] Is Troy here?
-[door buzzes] -[Bud] Troy!
Decided to take me up on my offer?
Not today, not tomorrow, not anytime.
-Here, you thirsty? -Ooh. Thank you!
-Get some of that in you. -Fifteen hundred is good money.
Like I said, Troy, Snake Eyes ain't for sale now.
Everything's for sale. You just have to be desperate enough.
-So, what do you got for Troy? -Desperate, huh? Mm-hmm.
-[rattling] -That's what I got for Troy.
Money. All right.
Right there.
-[Troy] Ooh, nice. -Count that.
Let's see, uh…
-Oh, this is a young male. -Mm-hmm.
Garden-variety, it's like Eastern…
Hey, smoker…
-Nasty habit, don't you think? -Yeah.
He would have died from smoking if he wasn't dead already.
Count the shit up.
Let's check this out. Uh, yeah, you see there?
-Yeah, solid bloodline. -Mm-hmm.
Must've gotten here through Mexico or something.
-He fed recently, you see that? -Yeah.
Okay. Well, how much?
Eight hundred? $800? A piece?
No, both.
Troy, what are you talking about? Look at that again.
-That's worth at least four grand. -Down at the Union.
-Why don't you try the Union? -Come on.
I can't go to the Union. You know that.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I… I forgot you can't go to the Union.
-That's why you're coming to me. Huh? -[table thuds]
And I'm offering you 800 for both.
All right, forget it. Just check the Elder's.
Elder?
That's a different story. That's 20 grand.
[finger snaps] Boom. Perfect. Done.
Yeah, yeah.
If she had been an Elder, which she's not. [laughs]
Check this out.
A decade early and a whole lot of dollars short,
so I can give you like two grand for this.
-Two thousand, Troy? -Mm-hmm. Two thousand?
Listen, I don't think you understand. I need cash today.
Then go and rob a bank or do something. I'm a businessman!
Forget the Elder's. How about this? Silver.
Silver? This is…
-Just gonna put that in your mouth, huh? -This plated shit? Please, Bud.
You wanna make a deal or not?
Shit.
Snake Eyes, 1,500.
Ah, twelve.
You said 1,500 when I walked in here. It is 1,500.
Before I knew you were desperate.
That's everything I have.
Well, I think you have something else.
Are those Jordans?
What size?
Hey. Hey, Pickle. How you doing?
[Paige] Dad, are we moving?
-Are we what? -Are we moving?
No. No. What makes you think that?
Mom says I might have to start a new school.
That's what Mom says, huh?
Well, you know Mom is a jokester, and I love her to death, but…
But we're not going anywhere.
You're not going anywhere, okay?
Okay, good. Thanks, Daddy.
-I love you. -I love you too!
I need you, bro.
[man on phone] We have already agreed to take delivery of the product
and to help with placement in Simi Valley.
You had no authority to take out Sasha.
I'm going to have to rethink our deal.
[Audrey] Sasha is the past, and I am the future.
We already own the night, but my product will allow us to seize the day.
So here is your choice.
You join me, and we take over the Valley, or you can join him. Comprendes?
[in Spanish] My precious…
[in English] It's just one man.
I can still smell him.
Find him.
Big J, you ain't changed a bit, baby. I see you. What's happening?
You know me, cutting necks and cashing checks.
Yeah. Thanks for meeting me, man.
Least I can do for the player that snatched my ass out the sandbox twice.
How's Seeger?
Same.
-Or worse. -Damn.
You think he'll listen?
-Things have changed since you left. -I ain't never left, Big J.
Well, since you got your ass kicked out the Union.
Look here. I'm putting my name and my ass on the line by vouching for you.
Can you play this shit by the books?
I got to. I got to get that Union card, or I'm gonna lose my family.
Look, I need ten large in the next five days,
or Joss is gonna take Paige down to Florida.
That's bad.
The Union is the only place gonna give me that kind of coin.
-I got you. Lock and load. -All right.
She's done this before, man. Pump faking, whatever.
She's done this before, man. Pump faking, whatever. But right now, it seems like it's real.
[in Japanese] Hi, Momoko!
How are you?
Momoko.
[in English] Yes?
Pink penguin puffy pants.
[Bud] See you ain't missed a step, Big J.
[woman on PA] JJ Perry to the trade counter.
-[Bud] Wow. -JJ Perry to the trade counter.
[Bud] I don't know how I feel about this.
Things really done changed around here, huh?
Yeah, we ain't just 818 no more. We done went international.
Look, Paris even blowing up tonight. Hmm.
Bet money's good out there.
Let's go and get this thing over with.
How's the shirt look?
Stop being nervous, man. Pull yourself together.
Hey, Big John.
[John] Well, hello, sunshine.
He's expecting you, but he's in one of his moods today.
I took this meeting out of respect for you, Big John.
God knows I wouldn't be sitting here without your support.
But, uh, I'm certain we all remember
that Mr. Jablonski's previous tenure as a Union member was…
chock-full of incidents.
Let's just take a look.
Northridge, 2014, violated code 103.
Encino, 2015, fleshed out a nest
while a child's birthday party was unfolding next door,
endangering civilians, violating codes 921, 833, and 605,
the worst of which was the failure to notify law enforcement in due time.
-That was a good bust. What happened was-- -And to top it all off…
Canoga Park, 2017,
violated code 101, endangering a fellow Union member's life.
Critical injury sustained.
He already had g… gout. He had gout.
Each of these incidents… meriting a lifelong suspension.
And yet, time and again, you were given warnings.
Why should I extend you yet another lifeline?
Ralph, let me be the first to tell you.
-Bud here, he's a new man. -Yeah.
Is that right?
Yes, sir. Absolutely. I'm a changed man.
I've cut out, uh… pork and cartoons and minimal white women.
Bud, I'm curious. Uh…
If you were in my position, sitting across from a man such as yourself,
would you let you back in?
If that person that is in question admits fault
and be apologetic, which I am, and,
on top of that, I just…
Look, Ralph…
Mr. Seeger, I just…
I really need to get out there. I need to do good.
I promise, if you give me that opportunity, I'm not gonna mess it up.
One last chance.
Now that we, uh, got that part settled,
I'm gonna go freshen up my coffee and let you gentlemen cross those T's.
That's a great guy. Great guy.
Really appreciate this second chance.
I don't know what the hell that man sees in you, Jablonski.
I mean, I know you served together, but, frankly, I don't care.
I've made it my life's work keeping cowboys like you out of the Union,
so I'll be watching you.
[menacingly] ♪ Every step you make ♪
♪ Every shit you take ♪
-♪ Every time you-- ♪ -[John] Everything good?
Quite. [clears throat]
Fill these out, all of them.
Once you pay your initial dues, we'll get you started on the health care plan.
There's dental included, right?
After a probationary period lasting…
30 days.
Come on, man. Three days.
Two weeks.
-One. -[sighs]
Fine.
With a Union rep accompanying him in the field.
-Generous. Thank you. -[Seeger] Great.
All right. Thanks, and, uh… [clears throat] …I want the night shift.
-Not on my life. -[Bud] Come on, Seeger.
-That's where the big money is! -[Seeger] No. Not a chance.
Amount of shit you stirred up working night shift,
you expect me to let you back out there where the sun don't shine?
Fine.
Day shift.
Good. Anything else?
No.
Oh, yeah. I got some, uh, teeth I need to sell.
Go to the cage.
Seeger, thank you kindly.
And remember, Bud,
one last strike.
Is… Are you referring to bowling, because…
-I'm saying there's a strike in bowl-- -You're back. That's all that matters.
Carol.
Carol, did you eat my yogurt again?
I even wrote my name on the lid today,
so you literally had to peel back my name to get to the yogurt.
Oh, what? You can't hear me?
I'm gonna fart in my yogurt, and you're gonna eat my fart.
Next.
Mr. Jablonski?
Yeah. Teeth.
So I look at it like this. I get back out there, do what I gotta do,
you know, for Mr. Mullet.
This is chipped, female.
Appears to be an almost Elder, roughly 90 years old.
Ninety? You probably need to check that again.
-You sure it's 90? -I'm sure.
Okay, whatever.
Full price still, right?
I'm sorry. Code 107 in the book clearly states anything--
Enough of the codes. It's fine.
-That's the net for the teeth. -Yeah, I'll come in… Hey!
However, due to the truncated processing time,
Mr. Seeger would like me to inform you we need your dues up front,
which, of course, is $5,000.
$5,000? I thought it was two?
Those are 2017 rates, Mr. Jablonski.
Then there is 15% off the top of every fang,
and we have to hold 50% until we receive your paperwork.
And, of course, $10 for your membership card,
which gets you one free app at Cheesecake Factory.
-I don't like cheesecake. -Do you have that?
Why won't you take the $10 out of that? Taking everything else.
You don't have cash on you? You really wanna make me split this?
Okay, you are good to go.
Am I?
If you have any issues with this,
Carol right here would be happy to further assist you.
Oh, great. I see you met your Union rep.
What?
[John] Come on, Bud.
Sir, please.
That new girl's a smoke show.
Right, but I'm begging you to reconsider. I'm not meant for the field.
I just bought an ergonomic chair with my own money. I'm all in on the desk.
That's why I need you out there with him. Right? Someone who knows the codes to the letter.
-Okay, but-- -Hey, hey, hey.
Do you wanna move up here?
You gotta get your ass out in the field. All right?
Think about it this way, you're gonna be my eyes and ears, my friend.
-Right? -Right--
And the minute he messes up, the minute he goes against code,
you'll be there reporting it back to me, right?
The sooner he fucks up, the sooner your sweet cheeks are in Carol's desk.
You work out?
-A little. -Yeah, thought so.
You're late.
Close it.
I was actually here an hour ago, but you weren't, so I went to go get us breakfast.
I got you an organic, gluten-free, paleo bran muffin.
Really? Thank you.
-I was starving. -That was a six-dollar muffin.
-What do you have on? -What?
-What are you wearing? -Just, like, normal clothes.
The handbook says blend in on the hunt. Be inconspicuous.
You have on a suit. How's that inconspicuous?
You have on a suit. We're in the Valley. In the summertime.
-It's a summery suit. -A summery suit?
-Juniper green. Yes. -What is juniper green?
A hue of green I found to be complementary against my skin tone.
Whatever it is, don't wear it again.
Look, I'll put myself together, and we'll take off, all right?
-Do you have somewhere I can hang this? -Yep.
Not there.
I'll just… hold on to it.
This ain't gonna last.
Got enough weapons and ammo in here to take down El Jefe, huh?
[chuckles] What you know about El Jefe?
Oh, come on. Legendary 700-year-old European vampire.
Some say he's at the top of the LA drug trade, just waiting for his moment to reemerge.
Fangs so sharp, with just one, you could buy a mansion in Bel Air. Hmm.
You sound like Big John.
Whole lot of gibberish. You know that's a crock of shit, right?
I didn't take you for an arts and crafts guy. -What are these all about? -Wanna keep your hands off my shit?
-What are these all about? -Wanna keep your hands off my shit?
It's my trophy case.
For each one that I kill, I, uh… They're already dead, but you get my drift.
'Cause they're allergic to wood. Smart.
They're allergic to wood, but not just any wood. It's mpingo wood.
The strongest African hardwood. Not that Ikea shit.
We mix it with the garlic. The wooden bullets pierce the heart.
-The silver-- -Silver to the throat. Right.
Yeah. Cuts the head off… usually.
Usually. Right, you are referring to Uber Vamps,
who have come back from decapitation.
[Bud] Not if you blast the heart with wood before you cut their throats with silver.
Mm-hmm. You also forgot to mention that you can kill them by burning them.
I didn't forget anything. That's how I get my money.
Why would I burn the fangs? I don't do that.
Listen, Guacamole Suit,
right there on the shelf, grab that for me.
Get that, we'll take off.
And remember, whatever you do, don't… drop my shit.
So, uh, where we going?
I'm going hunting. I don't know about you.
Why you wearing the seat belt like that?
Um, yeah, I mean, usually the seat belts aren't like this complicated and heavy. But--
It's not complicated. It's just a seat belt. It protects you.
Sure.
Sure. It's still protecting me though. If anything happened, it's just--
See? It still catches me.
I see.
It's gonna be a long day.
So, are you gonna tell me what we're doing at an animal shelter?
I'm gonna tell you shit.
What you know about Juvies?
Juvies or Juveniles, AKA Zombie Vamps,
formed when an already young vamp turns somebody else.
Instead of the strength of a full vamp,
they lack regenerative abilities and appear more dead than alive.
They can't process human blood yet, so what do they do?
-I'm aware. -They feed off of small animals, rodents.
So you've read the book?
I don't have to read it. I'm out here.
What do you know about different species of vampires?
I know there are five types. Southern, Eastern, Spider, Uber, and Juvenile.
They are largely solitary, but when together, there is a hierarchy.
They organize by age. What else?
The sunlight is the only thing they're scared of.
They can't reproduce, but they can turn people. Should I continue?
-What about familiars? -You think this guy's one of them?
I don't know. You tell me.
-Hmm? -I think he fits the profile.
-You think so? -Absolutely.
More powerful vamps have more powerful familiars.
And when it comes to Juvies, a little kid like this,
he's probably grabbing those cats for 'em, try to get 'em turned.
-Oh man. -What?
No, I'm just a big cat lover. I got two of them myself.
Oh. Okay. Well, that explains it.
-Want to see a picture? -No, I don't.
Maybe later.
All right. Here we go.
[Bud] There's his car.
Canoga Bowl. Closed for 18 months.
It's perfect.
-Can I offer some advice? -No.
I mean, economically speaking, why go after Juvies?
Why not let them ripen, come back when their teeth are valuable?
I could come back in September, but right now, I'm out of time.
And beggars can't be choosers.
Plus, you don't want these things biting people, do you?
Wait. Why don't you have time?
-Why you ask me so many questions? -I'm just--
Just stay in the truck and do your business.
Stay in the truck? No, I have to be with you at all times in the field.
-Union rules. -Other than keeping you alive,
-Union rules. -Other than keeping you alive, I don't give a shit about rules.
No, no, you don't understand. All times.
You're gonna stay in this car. With that in mind, here.
-What? No, I don't believe in guns. -You don't believe in 'em?
No, they're amoral. They're killing machines. They're not for me.
When I was a kid, I tried shooting a squirrel with a BB gun,
and I just couldn't. All right?
I still have nightmares where I can see his little face
making little squirrel noises, and I still have nightmares about it.
Made squirrel noises, huh?
-What does a squirrel noise sound like? -It's like…
Whatever! I don't wanna talk about it.
Stay in the truck.
It's impossible.
How the hell can you be here? It's daytime.
You've been a bad boy, Troy.
Did you know that a vampire cannot live without its fangs?
And yet, for whatever reason, whatever cruel joke from the gods…
they are the one thing we cannot regenerate.
Everything that makes a vampire a predator
is in its fangs.
Each set is a life that could have lived a thousand lives.
Lives that you had a part in ending.
Yet it wasn't always like this, you know?
There was a time when you humans, you worshiped us as gods.
Right here in this valley, you built temples of blood and bone to honor us.
And then you turned on us.
Well, guess what?
I'm gonna take back what's ours,
one property at a time.
The way I see it, you have two choices, two doors.
One, you bend the knee and join me in service, and you live.
And two…
you don't.
All right. So, what the hell do you want? Huh?
Who brought you this tooth?
A name.
You're so full of shit, lady.
You think you're a god?
You're not gods. You're a big mistake.
You're a genetic mutation that would've died out
if there hadn't been a stinking hole for y'all to crawl into.
Door number two it is.
No. No! [echoing] No!
Time for the tooth fairy.
Hello, sir.
How are we on this fine morning?
Any violations to report?
He is certainly heading that way,
but nothing verified quite yet.
Well, where is he now?
He left me in the car and went into a bowling alley.
You didn't follow him?
I thought he was gonna shoot me! He's very difficult to reason with, sir.
Kid! You want your promotion?
You want Carol's desk?
Then get off your ass, get in there, and verify those violations.
Ugh! Hair on your nipples!
-[Seth] Bud? -Seth!
-Seth! -Shit.
-Bud! -[Bud] Hurry up! Shoot it!
I… I don't have my gun!
-Give me my shotgun! -[snarling]
I'm… I'm just an observer!
Your gonna be hors d'œuvre if you don't give me that gun!
Shit! Shit! Shit!
Whoa! I'm sorry!
Next time I tell you, "Gimme that goddamn gun," you gimme that goddamn gun!
-Now duck! -What?
I said duck!
You okay?
Oh, jeez. That was horrible.
These Juvie teeth ain't worth shit, but get enough of 'em…
It's a number game like you said. Uh, you okay?
What's going on?
Oh, come on. No, no, I'm not okay.
-All right? Look at me! -What?
Vampires just tried to kill me.
You put a gun in my face, and now I just pissed my favorite fucking suit!
Hey, hey. Relax. You did good in there. You did good in there.
Besides, everybody pisses themselves the first time.
-Really? -Yeah.
-Did you? -No, I… No, I didn't. But listen, you did.
Here, dry your eyes. Dry your eyes, okay.
You know what?
Put it on me. My bad. We bit off more than we could chew today.
So why don't we go home, get some rest.
In the morning, we'll kick some motherfucking ass. Okay?
-Okay. -All right, come on.
Let's get in the car.
What the fuck is that? What'd you eat today?
You know what?
Let's have you get in the back. Don't want you to get that on my vintage seats.
-What, are you serious? -Damn right.
Come on. Gotta move.
Hang your leg out the back so we can air dry.
[Bud] Hey. Hey!
-You forgot your man-purse. -Wait. That's expens--
You gotta get some of this too.
I'm sure you know, Mr. Union Man. But when vamps are killed,
they release a gas that gets on you that other vamps can sniff out.
So you gotta get all of that off. Here, take this.
It's my special blend, like a little, uh, skunk musk, okay?
-Now, get that on you, in the shower. -Oh Jesus.
-Now, get that on you, in the shower. -Oh Jesus. On every inch of you, okay?
Be extremely careful. Don't get it in your eyes.
And whatever you do,
don't get it in your butthole. What happens in the butthole?
I mean, it can't kill you, but… Jesus Christ.
By the way, lock your doors, don't come out after dark, and, uh…
-Guess what? -What?
You're dried up.
Oh!
-[chuckles] Oh God. It's okay. -I'm sorry about that.
-No, no, me. I got it. -It's okay.
It's my fault. I couldn't see over my baskets.
I got it. This is a… You a… you a doctor?
Uh, nurse, actually.
Hope you don't think this is weird, but you got a lot of scrubs.
Yeah, I mean, I hate doing laundry, so I kind of just kept buying new ones.
-Got out of control. -Okay.
But, hey, new apartment. Why not start off on the right foot?
Yeah. Well, welcome to the building. I'm right there in 20.
-Oh! Well, I'm Heather. I'm in 19. -Well, I'm Bud 20. [chuckles]
Can you help me with that, actually?
[Bud] Oh. Yeah.
-[Heather] Thanks. -Yeah, no problem.
-You can just put that down anywhere. -Sure. Okay.
-See you've got a retro vibe poppin', huh? -Mm-hmm.
-Dig that. -Thanks.
I wish I had a beer or something to offer you.
Uh, a previous tenant left some ice cream in the freezer, if you're interested.
No, thanks. I'll take a rain check.
-You sure? -Yeah. Welcome to the building.
Thank you.
Feeling better?
Not really.
Got a little bit of that yellow stuff in my butthole.
It was so much worse than what you even described.
Bet it was.
You looking for something?
-Whoa. Hey, that's personal. -No, no, no.
"Violation code 101, terminated vamps and didn't report to the Union."
"Violation code 276, breaking and entering without Union sanctions."
-That did happen. -Violation. Violation. Violation.
Oh, look at this. "Needs to reimburse me for six-dollar muffin"?
It's a standard part of Union procedure.
-I have to document everything. -It's not.
It's for Seeger to keep me out the Union. Ain't that great?
You almost got me killed yesterday.
You almost got yourself killed yesterday.
I told you stay your punk-ass in the car. That's why I work by myself.
Listen. What? You're gonna die in the name of kissing your boss's ass?
Well, he didn't give me a choice, okay?
Listen to me, Mr. Union Fellow.
I may not follow all the Union rules, but let me tell you something.
If we went by the book, we'd both be dead by now!
And you saw that yesterday.
Look. Just give me a couple of days.
Okay, a couple days.
So, what's on the agenda today?
Like every day.
Hunting vampires.
[Seth] Bud, what are we doing at a pawn shop?
[Bud] This dude's cheap as shit, but he got goods we need in order to, uh…
What the hell?
Oh Jesus.
[whispers] Shut up. Shut up.
Hey, hey.
Don't you puke in here! Don't touch nothing. Don't leave your DNA.
I swallowed it.
Troy.
Troy?
Damn it.
Wait, is that…
It was.
[Seth] Oh no.
Who… who does that?
All right, we gotta move.
Wait a minute. Take this.
Are you kidding me?
-It's not right, okay. Wait-- -Damn right. How you think he feels, huh?
Come on, let's go.
Wait. You can't leave. That's against protocol.
We have to call the Union and wait for them.
-Code 233 says any hunter who encounters… -Code? I don't give a shit.
…suspicious civilian death will be under a 30-day suspension--
We don't have 30 days. I don't give fuck!
We gotta leave. There's other vamps around here. Let's go.
No, no. I'm calling.
Whoa! We have dead humans here. We have to report this.
That ain't no dead human! That's my friend!
Listen, I'm not telling you you cannot report it.
I'm just telling you to delay it.
We'll make an anonymous call to the cops, and, after 24 hours,
you can make your funky little report. Let's go!
Why do you care? What difference does a day make?
I'm gonna lose my family in a day! That's the difference!
What?
Look, if I don't score some prices at Union wages by Monday,
my wife and my daughter move to Florida.
That means, if you call Seeger, I'm gonna lose my family.
I'm… I'm sorry.
Yeah, I bet you are.
So what you're saying is you… you kinda need me.
But… No, I didn't… I didn't say I need you. I didn't say that.
-No, I just mean… -I didn't say that.
You told me your secrets. I'm gonna break protocol for you.
-So we're like a team, partners, whatever. -I didn't say partners.
-Crockett and Tubbs. -No.
-Any partnership you find satisfactory. -Listen.
What I'm saying is this, is as a man, just give me till the weekend.
Yeah, okay. Until the weekend.
Yeah.
[Heather] Look. What do you want me to do? If I keep… he's gonna suspect something.
Just relax.
[Bud] I got a tip on this house from Big J.
Why don't you check the glove box right now?
Yeah.
That's what we're doing right there.
That's what we doing.
These… garlic grenades.
Pull the pin, garlic and sawdust comes out, clears the room.
I think. Haven't actually had to use it.
But, in theory, that's what's gonna happen.
An unproven weapon for my first real vampire fight.
-That's wonderful. Thank you. -Shit. Shit!
What? What?
Goddamn Nazarian Brothers.
Wait, the Nazarian brothers. Oh, they're big-time hunters.
Yeah, not bigger than me though.
They cleared out all of Glendale. Now they're headed west.
-Hey, Bud. -[music stops]
I thought I smelled chlorine.
[sniffing] Funny. Thought I smelled shit.
-Who's the cupcake? -[Seth] Seth.
I'm his Union rep. But you can call me Cupcake or whatever you prefer.
-I'm a big fan, by the way. -Want to get a selfie for your Instagram?
What you guys doing in Simi Valley?
You know what we're doing here, bro.
We let you do the hard part for us,
figure out which house is hiding the goods, then, you know.
You got me twisted. I did the work, but I ain't do it for you.
Oh, come on, Bud. Think about it.
Waste a week waiting for the right moment that we just might take from you?
Or we run up there in force right now.
Sack the place together. Split the money down the middle.
Well, one, ain't nobody taking shit from me.
And two…
Yeah. It's a good idea.
-[techno music resumes] -Wanna get a selfie?
Right now? Is that appropriate?
-We can wait-- -That's not appropriate at all.
-What's this? -Keep your neck from getting chewed out.
Take this. Stay behind me. I keep you alive.
Don't shoot where they are. Shoot where they're gonna be.
You ready? Let's go.
♪ Ooh, baby, I like it raw Yeah, baby, I like it raw ♪
What's the garlic for?
Any vamp gets close to me, I spit in their eye,
melt hole in their fucking head.
Bro, you got any more gum?
-You always share that with your brother? -We share everything.
D, you're supposed to pry that shit open, not smash it.
Hey. Are we inside the house or not, bro?
Don't even think about it.
-[shotgun cocks] -Got him.
Nice shot, bro. Time to get paid.
Open up.
I told him not to do it.
-Really? -I'm sorry.
-Put that gun down. -Okay.
-Take your finger off the trigger. -Right. Okay.
Just watch my six. Six… Uh…
-It's a hive. -What?
Showtime, bro.
Head on out.
Bitch-ass.
Keep your head on a swivel, all right? And stay away from the walls.
-Oh shit! Bud! -[grunts]
Bud! I don't… What do I do?
Ah! You gotta stop wiggling!
Oh no!
No!
-[clicking] -Oh shit! The gun's broken!
-[Bud] Take the safety off! -Help, Bud! My gun's not working.
[Seth yelling] Oh, come on!
Oh God!
Buckshot mouthwash, baby.
Nice, bro. Yes.
I got six.
You got six. I got five. I'll catch you up.
Oh shit! Bud, help me!
-[snarls] -Wait, hold up! Wait, hold on! Ah!
[Bud] Don't let it bite you, Seth!
Haircut time, bro.
I'm out!
Bud, help me! Bud, help!
This motherfucker threw me up the stairs?
Bro, send one!
[Seth yelling] No good!
Nice work, bro.
Help! Help me!
-[vampire snarling] -Seth, my shotgun!
-Big money, baby. -Huh? This is what I was talking about.
-This was good, yes? -Very good.
What happened to you? You piss your pants?
It's kinda my thing.
-Bro. -What you doing? What're you doing?
Listen, pee-pee pants, this is man's world, not little boy.
Gonna get you a Pamper. Anyway, listen. Be safe, man. Okay?
I'mma take this and put it towards my baby girl's tuition, you know?
That's why I'm out here. You know…
Familiar on the run.
I got it.
-He's up again. That was vampire. -I know.
Streets done changed. I hear they got this sunscreen that they put on.
It's real thick, and they can now last out in the sunlight like 15, 20 minutes.
You know it's made from the shell of desert tortoise.
It's illegal in 40 countries, right, bro?
Vampire sunscreen? The Valley? I don't like the sound of this.
-Hey, wait, this doesn't make sense. -'Sup?
Okay, that's a Spider, but that's an Uber.
Those are Southerns, and…
Yeah, that's an Eastern. You can tell by his fangs in the front.
Ain't Bloods and Crips. It's the Valley. They cross-pollinate.
No, these vamps would never choose to live together.
Ubers are solo-nesters.
Spiders cohabitate, but never with Easterns and Southerns.
-They'd steal their food. -[Diran] Listen to this kid. Huh?
This joker reads a few books, he thinks he knows more than the pros.
No, no, wait, wait, wait. Kid makes a good point.
-But… -[watch beeps]
But I'm outta time. I gotta go pick up the little one. Come on.
Pull these fangs. And why don't you go to the bathroom and dry off your dick.
You okay?
I don't know.
I just keep thinking about how all those vampires we just killed
used to be regular people.
[chuckles] There you go.
The old vampires-are-just-like-us routine.
But they're not, Seth.
You know what I see when I see a vamp? Big old dollar signs.
'Cause all they are is murderers and liars.
It ain't Brad Pitt in a leather jacket and some blood raves.
It's not Eclipse. It's not New Moon. It's not Breaking Dawn Part One.
It ain't like that, all right?
Why do you know the names to all the specific Twilight films?
What's your gripe with Breaking Dawn Part 2?
It's the exciting conclusion of the whole Twilight Saga.
Wha… Have you seen Part 2?
Bella has her baby now. It's insane.
-She had the baby? -Oh, I wish I was you!
To experience that the first time. You're in for a treat.
My daughter hipped me to all that. I don't really get into all that.
But you got something different, Seth.
You're tougher than you think you are.
No.
I'm serious.
You're just saying that so I don't report you to Seeger.
No, I'm not. You got what it takes. I'm telling you. You have that instinct.
You could be a real hunter out here.
Telling you right now.
Fuck Carol.
Fuck accounting.
You could do this.
-Hey. Hey! -Hi, Dad!
-Dad? What happened to "Daddy"? -Little kids say, "Daddy."
Oh, is that right? "Dad," huh?
Everything's changing around here.
You're late. Again.
So, what is all this?
Well, I can't actually sell the house without putting it on the market.
Yeah. Last I checked, it's three days until Monday.
Come on, Dad. We're gonna be late to the party.
You know, I was thinking, what if we don't go?
What if we stay here at the house and eat pizza, some ice cream--
Bud. No. She's been talking about this all week. You promised.
Yeah, well, I just didn't think it was the right time right now.
What? Okay, give me a reason why.
Right. So, Daddy was just kidding. He was just being weird.
-[Bud] Yeah. -Yeah, you guys are going to a party!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. -See, Daddy was just being strange.
-Strange, yeah. -Yeah.
-Come on. -Bye.
-Bye, baby. -Bye.
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday… ♪
-Cake time, baby. I'll check on the kids. -All right.
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
Hello?
[Audrey] I've been looking for you, Bud.
Who is this?
Troy spoke so highly of you.
Your name was the last thing on his lips when he died.
You know how this ends, don't you?
You tell me.
With you on your knees in front of me,
begging for the lives of your wife and your daughter.
You took something from me, and now I'm gonna take everything from you.
Enjoy the party.
-Yay! -[all cheering] [Bud] Aw. Nice. Ha ha. That's so nice. We gotta go, baby. That's so nice.
We gotta go, baby. That's so nice. -Happy birthday. -Bye, Paige.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Up, up, up.
Look, buckle yourself in, okay?
Look, in here, all right. Now let's put your headphones on, okay?
Got your iPad right here. Now listen. Dad's gonna be driving.
You might feel a little swerving, but that's just my special driving.
Just pick up, pick up, pick up.
[Joss] Can't talk. Meeting a realtor.
-Don't hang up! -Why? Is Paige okay?
-Uh, yeah, she's great, but, uh… -[game chimes]
Look, Joss, we're in trouble, okay? All of us.
What? What are you talking about? There's a lot I need to tell you.
I know you've had trouble trusting me in the past.
I know you think I keep things from you, but right now, you gotta trust me.
-I don't want to lose either of you. -Now you're freaking me out.
Pack your bags, be ready to go, and I will explain everything, okay?
-A bag? -[hangs up]
All right.
Hey. You took your headphones off, huh?
I already won my race. Besides, looks like you can use my help.
Uh, you're not wrong on that.
Light!
Car!
Thank you!
All right, big jump. Big jump!
There's a guy on the right!
[Bud] Hold on.
Cover your ears, sweetie.
[Paige] That was awesome.
[Bud] Yeah? Just don't tell your mother.
Come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on. All right. Come on. Let's run.
Come on. All right. Come on. Let's run.
-You ever heard of Jackie Joyner-Kersee? -Uh, no.
-I'll show her to you. -Okay.
-[screams] -No! No! No!
No!
[Joss] No, no, no! Stop!
[Audrey] Hola, Bud.
I told you you'd be on your knees begging for their lives.
It's okay. It's okay.
So beg.
-Go to hell. -Oh, your compadre said the same thing.
Oh shit. Baby, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for this, Joss. Are you okay?
Yeah.
What is happening, Bud?
I could try to explain it right now, but it's not gonna make any sense.
-But-- -But what?
I'm not exactly a pool cleaner.
Well, then, what are you?
I…
hunt vampires.
-What? -[Bud] Yeah. I hunt vampires.
-Vampires? -Yeah. That's what I do.
-Vampires? -[Bud] Yeah.
Okay, so all of the lies, all of the late-night calls, all of the locks…
Come on, man.
The reason I'm separated from the man I love is vampires? Ow!
Stop choking her like that!
Come on, Bud. We said we were gonna be honest with each other.
We are.
-[Bud] I know. Don't look at it. -Oh my God! -[Bud] Listen… -[hissing]
I wanted to tell you. I just didn't know how.
Okay. Okay, so…
Uh, what do you want?
What do I want?
You and your daughter.
-They're not a part of this! -Pendejo, you made them a part of it!
-Don't touch me! -Don't touch her!
I'm not afraid of you.
[gasps] Such a brave muñeca.
Take them.
-No! No! -No, don't touch her!
-Leave her alone! Get your hands off her! -Don't touch her!
[Bud grunts] I'll come get you! -[Paige] Daddy! -[Joss groans]
-I'mma fix all of this. I love y'all! -[Audrey] Cálmate, Bud.
A new day is dawning, and your little girl's gonna be a part of it.
[Audrey] First, I'm gonna turn her, and then I'm gonna watch as she drinks your wife.
[sighs] I wish you could be there to see it,
but I'm afraid someone's having you for dinner.
[Paige in English] Daddy!
Oh, I'm alive.
Oh, Bud.
Oh, I feel weird.
Yeah, I bet… I bet you do.
What happened to me?
Just some bullshit. You know how shit go.
But, uh…
-[groans] -You probably wanna… check your teeth.
Check my teeth?
Yeah, just check them. There's a mirror over there. Oh…
Oh! Oh no!
Oh no. Oh, that's not good.
-What! That was totally involuntary. -It's like a hiccup, probably.
-[gasps] -I'm sorry, man, it was all my fault.
How you feel?
Pretty horrified about the fact that I'm a vampire.
-Right. Right. -But also like…
-I don't know, kind of amazing. -Yeah, like--
Like my blood, it just… it feels like it's on fire--
Like you had, like, a lot of energy drinks.
[sniffs] Oh, I can smell everything!
Oh God, did I shit myself this time?
No, no, no, you look fine.
-Is there like a mark? -No, you look good.
Everything looks great.
Listen, let's just take it easy.
-We're gonna work this out. -[stomach rumbling] Oh wow.
Mainly I just… Whoa, I just feel
hungry!
Goddamn it, Seth.
I'm sorry, kid.
I'm actually gonna miss you, man, you know?
It's crazy how you get attached to someone.
Oh shit.
Bud?
You cut my head off. I thought we were friends.
I… You rushed me.
It's just reaction. That's what I do.
It's in my blood. It's like… You ever see Tyson? He…
You don't walk up on Tyson either.
Friendship is complicated, huh?
Yeah, friendships are complicated.
All right, wait. Follow my voice. Left, there. Yep, okay.
Easy. No. Okay, easy, easy.
[groaning] Okay, here we go.
The fuck?
Okay, gentle. Gentle. [exhales]
Huh. Still fits.
Wha…
Oh, it's been quite the week.
Yeah, it has. You good?
-How do I look? -You look all right.
-You feel all right? -You swear?
-Yeah. -[hisses]
-Hey! -Sorry. Just kidding.
-Okay. All right. -Too soon. Too soon. All right.
Hey, I'm sorry I tried to eat you.
How 'bout we not report this to Seeger until Monday?
Seeger, shit. Oh, what? You don't think he's gonna notice?
What, am I just supposed to wear turtlenecks from now on?
I mean, I do look good in a T-neck, but that's not sustainable.
-Wait. Where are we going? -Going to get my family back.
I have to stop at my place and get some information.
What's going on with your neck? Is it repairing itself?
I actually think it is.
Okay, just be careful. Don't go over any speed bumps.
Damn. Damn.
My bad.
[Seth] You have a driving problem. You know that, right?
I gotta go to apartment 19.
I'll be back in five.
Heather, you just moved in. Leaving so soon?
Bud, just listen to me.
Look, we need to talk.
Talk? Vampires kidnapped my family. You wanna talk?
-I didn't have a choice. -I don't give a rat's ass.
This is stupid, Bud. Let me at least explain.
Okay, listen.
Because of you, my family got kidnapped, and my friend is dead.
Or undead.
So I don't want no problems, I just…
That's what she does, Bud.
-[groans] -She turns people against their will.
I wasn't even a familiar. She just… just did this to me.
You think I wanna work for a monster like her?
Then why do you?
-She's my maker, okay? -What?
And an Uber Vamp.
Look, she forced me to get close to you.
She wanted to get back at you for what you did to her. What you talking about?
She just… She just wanted to know how to hurt you.
Why?
So, you just gonna light your finger on fire, huh?
You killed a vampire Monday, didn't you?
-Sweet old lady? -Not so sweet, actually.
That was Audrey's daughter.
Daughter? How?
When she came over, she had a little girl she had to leave behind.
So by the time they went back, found her, and turned her, she was old.
-And I killed her. -And you killed her.
And now they got Paige and Jocelyn.
I'm sorry.
-[door slams] -Hey, Bud. I don't feel so good.
[moans] Could you hold my head for a little?
Holy shit.
You're walking on sacred ground. You should be honored.
Where are you taking us?
-Why, are you frightened? -No.
You should be.
Well, then you don't know me that well, bitch. Ah!
Why are you doing this?
Paige, don't talk to her.
She has a right to know.
You don't get to decide-- [gasps]
I had a daughter once, feisty like you.
I wanted to make a better world for her.
A world where she could be free from hiding.
But your father took that away from me.
Now, you see, it's only fair I take you away from him.
-If you hurt her, I'll kill you. -[snarls]
But I'm already dead.
I'm not gonna hurt her, Ms. Jablonski.
I'm gonna make sure no one can ever hurt her again.
-You should thank me. -[gasping]
A war is coming,
and your little girl's gonna be on the winning side.
-[Paige] No! -Paige!
[Paige] Let me go!
No. No!
-[Joss grunts] -Come on.
-[squelching] -[Bud] Seth, hold your head still.
Looks like they've turned him with Uber blood, so he'll be unpredictable for a while.
He'll get under control eventually.
[Bud] Here.
[moans] No, I'm pescatarian.
Come on.
-[groans] Mm. Mmm! -[Bud] There we go.
You hunters are always complaining about LA running dry.
That's what Audrey's trying to change.
It's, like, sweet but a little tangy.
That's nice. [burps] Oh yeah, get inside of me.
She uses her cover as a realtor to buy properties all over the Valley
and move vamps back in amongst the rest of us.
Within a year, all vamp activity in LA
will be traceable to her sitting at the top.
Not if I get to her first.
I'll lead the way.
-All right, I'm coming too. -No, no, no. No. Hell no, Seth.
You got too much energy now. You fresh off some blood.
I don't want you to switch up on me, try to bite my kidneys out.
No, Bud, listen. They tortured me.
Okay, they drank my blood. They cut my head off.
I guess technically, you cut my head off, but they turned me into this, okay?
-I want to help take her down. -Okay.
We'll get you changed, head back to my spot, and we'll gear up.
-Oh, right now? -Yeah, right now.
What? It's dark out. That's a suicide mission.
Welcome to the motherfucking night shift.
[Seth] Oh shit!
-Ah! Oh, they got me! -[Heather] Look, Seth, calm down!
They're expecting humans. It's lead. It can't hurt you.
-Really? -Yes. But, hey, let it make you mad.
[Bud] You okay?
This one actually hurts. Shit. Ah! Ah!
[Seth] Bud, what do we do? We're surrounded.
Black Cowboy.
Get down.
How the hell you get here?
[John] The snowflake.
I might have texted him.
-Welcome to the fucking Union, brother. -Thank you.
-Hey, hey, if you don't get your ass off-- -Oh. Sorry.
-This way. -Sorry.
[Bud] Come on, Big J.
After you.
Bud, in the back, look for the staircase. That's the entrance to her tunnel.
Keep going down, and you'll find her.
There's a faster way down, but you wouldn't survive it.
We survive everything. See me fighting a bear, you pour honey on me.
You two go ahead. We'll catch up.
Come on. Let's get cracking.
Just like old times.
[John] I'm out.
Look at this shit here. Jackpot.
[John] Man, look at all this gear.
Okay.
Ugh. Shit, look at this. All this sunscreen.
Vamps runnin' around in the day. She could take over the Valley.
[Bud] Handle him, J!
Okay.
-Oh shit. -[grunts]
I see you. He didn't know, did he?
He didn't know.
-[man grunts] -[Bud] Whoo! Get him, J.
[John] Stay down, fool.
Yo. You did that without even stretching, huh?
That was my weak leg.
See all this? Huh?
All these guns?
[John] Check it out. Silver-tipped wooden bullets. Vampire killers.
What's that about?
Is she El Jefe?
Nah. El Jefe is bigger than this, brother.
But, either way, that bitch got an ass-whooping coming.
Yeah.
Yeah, they down here.
Let's get cracking.
[John] Just like old times.
[distorted voice] He's coming.
I can smell him.
I don't know how all this works, but I know my husband,
and he's gonna murder you.
-Ex-husband. -See, now you're just being a bitch.
[in Spanish] Bring him to me.
[in English] Paige.
-This place ain't creepy at all. -[Bud] Tell me about it.
Here we go.
Bud!
[Audrey] Jablonski…
[grunts] John!
[Bud] That's how we do, baby.
You know how we do. We bag 'em, and we tag 'em.
That's how we get it done.
-[John groans] -What's going on with you?
Ain't nothing going on. Ain't nothing wrong with me, man.
-You all right? -Shit. You know they can't fuck with me.
Okay, but why you leaning like that?
We been battle-tested. This don't mean nothing.
-All right. -Nothing but a flesh wound, dog.
Okay. Still, it don't look too good. Come on, let's get up out of here.
Come on. We ain't got much time. Gotta get you out of here. Come on, man.
-Big John, what the hell is you doing? -I'm saving your Black ass.
-Big John, what the hell is you doing? -I'm saving your Black ass. What are you talking about?
Go get your family right now. I got this.
-We can't do it like this. -You know I work alone.
-You crazy motherfucker. -Go.
-You better stay alive. -Go!
I'll be here waiting for you!
All right, motherfuckers, come on!
West side for life!
John…
I'm not supposed to kill you yet, but you've been a real pain in the ass,
so give me one good reason.
Burn in hell.
Good enough.
-You're working on that landing, huh? -No, I planned it like that.
Go, we've got him.
-[gasping] -[Paige] No!
[Bud] Paige! Stay back.
Daddy!
-Joss, you okay? -[moans] Yeah.
All right. I'll let you go.
A life for a life or whatever the hell you have.
You took my daughter, Jablonski.
-I'm just returning the favor. -No.
-[Paige] Mommy! -Baby!
What do you think, muñeca?
I'm gonna kill your daddy, then I'm gonna make you drink your mean old mommy,
and then I'm gonna be your new, improved mommy.
-How does that sound? -[Joss moans]
I hate you!
That's not very nice.
I hate you too.
Daddy!
I should've just got another job.
-Baby, get up! -Come on, Daddy, get up!
Baby, I'm trying.
-[Paige] Try harder. -Oh, okay.
[in Spanish] In the end, the devil comes for everyone.
[in English] That's what you get.
[in Spanish] Bitch.
[in English] No!
Mommy!
Pull!
Wood to the heart, silver to the neck.
[in Spanish] Your last bullet, cabrón?
[in English] No!
[in Spanish] Fucking pool boy.
[in English] The best.
Y'all good?
Works every time.
Let's go.
Come on, babe. Let's go.
All right.
-Hey. Where's Seth? -Hey.
-Whoa! -No, no, no. Babe, babe, no.
They're the good vampires.
That's my girl Heather. That's my guy Seth.
-Hey. -Hey.
Whose arm is that?
Oh. Sorry.
But, Bud… got my first pair of fangs.
That's big money right there.
-Guess what? -What's that?
I didn't pee myself this time.
-Get out. -Vampires don't pee or poop.
Nah, they don't.
-Please let me have this little victory. -Of course you can. C'mon. Let's go.
Do they really not pee or poop?
-Does that mean they're full of shit? -[Bud] Language!
[Bud] Big John.
I'll miss you, baby.
Oh, no.
It's got good energy in that.
All right.
We were hiding right over there. Right over there.
Jablonski!
Seeger? What the hell you doing, walking all fast like that?
New shoe boots on.
And you. What are you, sick?
-Uh, pink eye. -What?
It's when poo particles get in your eye.
Where's Big John?
Oh goddamn it!
I did you a solid.
But now you have graciously returned the favor
because after the shit you pulled here tonight,
I'll never have to deal with you again.
For starters,
flagrantly violating code 682, operating outside of your shift.
Actually, sir, if I may.
Code 741 states that, "If a hunter is in a 911 situation,
he may circumvent normal operating hours
so long as he notifies the Union before entering," which he did.
Thank you. Thank you for that.
There's also code 584, unlawful termination of familiars
without prior authorization.
Yes, sir, that is correct, but Section 4 states,
"When fired on, a hunter is lawfully allowed to return fire,"
which is what happened here.
Code 424, "A Union hunter must make all reasonable efforts
to limit collateral damage to property while engaging in a hunt."
Boom!
-Sir, code 42-- -I got this.
Code 424 was rescinded by the national office in January.
Boom. Boom.
-Someone's been reading. -Saw it in the newsletter.
Yeah. I see what's going on here.
Loopholes.
Think you're smarter than me?
Then you can probably spell "traitor."
Sure.
T-R-A-I-T-O-R. What was the point of that?
Carol's keeping her fucking desk.
Good! She can have it.
I'm a field man now! Mowing down vamps with my best friend Bud.
-That felt good. [laughs] -You did that.
Wait. Shit. What are you gonna do about the money?
-Oh, I'm good. -[rattles]
Think I'm gonna be all right.
And, uh…
fuck Carol.
Hey, should I drink Carol?
No, no, that's a lot of cholesterol. Right, okay.
I won't go out of my way, but if, like, there's a chance encounter
outside her house at night or…
-Yeah. Later. -See you, guys!
-Bye. -See you, guys.
What about us?
What about us?
I was thinking, what if we tried this whole, you know,
stay on the same groove type thing.
You know, me cooking breakfast. You know?
How about we take it one day at a time, but no more lies.
After what we've seen tonight, there is no reason to lie.
So I ask you a question, and you give me a straight answer.
I can live under those terms, you know.
Yeah, I don't think we're there yet.
Mm-hmm. You just gonna leave me like this?
Mmm. Jump back, want to kiss myself.
[Paige] I'm gonna be a vampire hunter too.
[Bud] Uh… -[Bud] No. -[Joss] No.
-[Paige] Daddy, why do you call me Pickle? -[Bud] Because that's what you are, baby.
Sometimes you're a sweet pickle, sometimes you're a sour pickle,
and sometimes you're a salty pickle.
[Paige] I love you, Daddy.
Happy birthday to you!
WESLEY: It's my anorexic boss' birthday. (ALL CHATTERING)
This means there's a certain amount of inter-office pressure
to stand around the conference table
eating crappy food and pretending to worship her.
That's so good.
That's so good. Acting for five minutes like Janice doesn't make all our lives miserable
is the hardest work I'll do all day.
My job title is account manager.
I used to be called an account service representative,
but a consultant told us we needed to manage our clients
and not service them.
I have a girlfriend whom I neither manage nor service.
That's my best friend, Barry, fucking her on an IKEA kitchen table
I picked up for a really good price.
I'm finding it hard to care about anything these days.
In fact, the only thing I do care about is the fact that I can't care about anything.
Seriously. It worries me.
My name is Wesley Gibson.
My dad walked out on my mom when I was seven days old.
Sometimes I wonder if he ever looked into my baby blues eyes and asked himself,
"Did I just father the most insignificant asshole of the 21st century?"
Well, if you could get me the consignment to me by the 28th... Yeah.
Do you have the numbers in front of you?
Relax.
If your name had come up, you'd be dead already.
We've had some unexpected losses recently.
We'd like to know
where our competitor is getting his munition.
It's clean.
Meaning?
Meaning it's untraceable.
Your competitor's very smart.
(HIGH-PITCHED WHIRRING) Get down!
Fuck it.
No one leaves the Fraternity, Cross.
CROSS ON PHONE: I have a new perspective on the Fraternity.
Careful.
You don't destroy something that's been around for a thousand years.
It's already destroyed. He broke the code.
I have to stop this.
Really? You know this.
So why don't you face me yourself?
Never send sheep to kill a wolf.
They were just the decoys.
Goodbye, Mr. X.
MR. X: Never send sheep to kill a wolf.
They were just the decoys.
CATHY: Wesley!
What is it?
What do you mean, "What is it"? Listen.
(RUMBLING)
Well, how am I suppose to sleep with all that fucking racket?
When are we gonna move so we don't have to wake up to that shit?
I kind of like it.
WESLEY: It helps to drown out the sound of your annoying, fucking voice.
Now, please, let me sleep.
Have you even thought about our talk?
Yes.
Which one?
Perfect. That's perfect.
Feed Annabelle.
Sorry.
(LAUGHING) Oh, my fucking God.
I hope that's not my billing report sitting on your desk.
Holy shit on an altar, it is.
I want that report on my desk in one hour.
Okay, everybody, we're all gonna stay an extra hour...
WESLEY: Want to hear something sad?
I need an ergonomic keyboard to keep my repetitive stress injury in check.
Just the fact that I repeat something enough that it causes me stress is fucking sad.
Nice job, dude. You seen Barry?
He had to go to the dentist. Again.
Yes! (MOANING)
Barry!
You think they have that morning-after pill here?
That thing works. Crush it up, put it in her omelet,
"Hey, baby, breakfast in bed." You can never be too safe.
Oh, God.
I lost my wallet somewhere.
All this together?
Yes. No, no.
He is the man.
How much is it? Oh. Plus this.
PHARMACIST: $20.42.
(WHISPERING) Watermelon.
Chicks dig it.
Thanks.
See you next time.
PHARMACIST: Have a good night.
I love these energy drinks, man.
I'm almost, like, kind of on an energy drink cleanse,
where I do one for breakfast and then, like, two or three for lunch.
WESLEY: I'm the man? (SCOFFING) Yeah, right, Barry, I'm the man.
In fact, I'm so much the man,
I have a standing prescription for medication to control my anxiety attacks.
God, I wish I had something else to relieve my stress.
Hello, Wesley.
WESLEY: You know, there are people, beautiful people,
you just wish they could see you in a different setting, a different place,
instead of where you are, what you've become.
(WHISPERING) Nicole is so hot.
What?
Boom goes the dynamite.
WESLEY: But most of all, you wish you weren't such a pussy
for wishing for things that will never change.
JANICE: Good God A'mighty, you're over here like it's spring fucking break,
and I still don't have that billing report.
Why do I even keep you around, Wesley?
I'll get it done, Janice.
(SCOFFING) Like I never heard that before. "I'll get it done."
(HEART BEATING) "I'll get it done. I'll get it done, Janice.
"I'll get it done." (INDISTINCT DISTORTED CHATTERING)
Why don't you have anything to say for yourself?
(DISTORTED) I'm sorry.
Well, you're worthless.
I'm the one who's sorry I hired your ass.
WESLEY: You know what the best thing is about the end of the day?
Tomorrow it starts all over again.
Hi. How you doing? Good.
You apologize too much. I'm sorry?
Sorry about that.
I knew your father.
My father left the week I was born, so...
Your father died yesterday on the rooftop of the Metropolitan Building.
Sorry.
Look, the liquor rounds are just over there, so...
Your father was one of the greatest assassins who ever lived.
The man who killed him is behind you.
(HEART BEATING FASTER)
This guy's just shooting up...
Sorry. Sorry.
(ELECTRONIC BARKING)
What... Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What the fuck just happened?
Please! Please! Please drive faster.
Please drive... Please drive faster. Please be quiet.
Please... Please understand that I care about my life!
I don't know what the fuck you did to piss this guy off,
but you're gonna have to let me out and call the cops!
Hey! Hey!
(SIREN WAILING)
What are you doing? Oh, shit! Are you crazy?
Oh, shit!
I think we lost him. I think we lost him.
Could you let me out at the next corner, please?
Shit!
Fuck!
Oh, shit!
He's right there!
Look, I'm an accountant. I'm just an accountant.
Oh, fuck!
He's fucking persistent, you know.
Fuck!
You kick his ass!
Shoot him!
What are you doing? What are you shooting our car for, huh?
Are you crazy? Grab the wheel.
Where are you going?
Get back in here!
Oh, my God!
Oh, damn! I'm sorry.
What? Gun!
Under the seat!
Here.
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Look out! Get out!
Look out! Oh, my God!
Shit!
WESLEY: I'm sorry!
OFFICER: Behind you!
Fuck.
Shit. Shit.
Hello.
I don't have any money or...
SLOAN: I thought he'd be
taller.
Taller?
Sir...
Sir, I've been trying to explain to the lady here that I'm an accountant.
I'm an account service representative... I'm an account manager.
And I'm sure that if you call my boss, Janice, she'd fill you in on whatever has gone wrong.
she'd fill you in on whatever has gone wrong.
You can contact her by email or... She'll put you straight.
Shoot the wings off the flies.
I don't know what that means.
Shoot the wings off the flies.
I really think you have me mixed up with somebody else.
On three.
Either you shoot, or I do.
One.
Okay.
Two.
I can't even see them!
Three.
Okay. Okay.
That's impossible.
SLOAN: A lot of things for you weren't possible before today.
What you experienced, Wesley, was not a panic attack.
Your heart was beating in excess of 400 beats per minute,
sending abundant amounts of adrenaline into your bloodstream.
This allows you to see and react faster than normal.
Only a few people in the world can do that.
Your father could do it and you can do it.
With a little work, you can learn to control these attacks.
Stay away from me.
Just stay back from me.
I have a gun, sir. All right?
My name is Sloan.
This is Fox.
And the others you see around you are all very good at killing.
So, if I were you, I'd keep the gun pointed at me.
You don't wanna point it at any of them.
That's better.
You're insane. No.
Insanity is wasting your life as a nothing
when you have the blood of a killer flowing in your veins.
Insanity is being shit on, beat down,
coasting through life in a miserable existence
when you have a caged lion locked inside and a key to release it.
This gun you're holding is an Imanishi 17. It belonged to your father.
He could conduct a symphony orchestra with it.
And you're going to use it to kill the man who shot him down in cold blood.
I can't... The same man who tried to kill you tonight.
Your father was one of us.
A fraternity of assassins. The weapons of fate.
We've transferred all of his assets over to you.
And let me assure you, they are substantial.
It is your long-awaited destiny
to join us.
Back off. Back off.
You don't know anything about me.
Stay away from me. Stay away from me.
You stay away from me?
You stay away from me, please? Will you let me through?
WESLEY: You know when you have a dream and you're half awake,
but it's still in the fringe of your brain?
Then you open your eyes and you're so damn glad it was a dream. (CLANKS)
This was nothing like that.
I'm sorry. Could you just give me one second? Thank you.
Oh, shit.
(SIGHS)
(WHISPERING) Wesley.
What's up with you?
What do you mean?
You're... You're here early.
Is... You seem a little pepped up.
Well, yeah. You all right?
Yeah.
I guess I feel
kind of different.
Whatever. I'm gonna go get some Post-it Notes. Do you want one?
No. Really?
Yeah. Okay.
Jesus H. fucking Popsicle, I still don't have my billing reports,
but you've got time to sit here and Google your ass off.
Well, I know one thing.
You've got your review coming up next week,
and I can't wait to start checking me off some big fucking boxes.
(HEART BEATING) Attitude, poor! Performance, poor!
Management skills, poor!
(SCOFFS) Works well with others. That's a fucking joke. (HEART BEATING FASTER)
What is this bullshit? Who's this prick?
Some loser gets his head blown off at the Metropolitan...
Shut the fuck up!
She has one single iota of tenuous power.
She thinks she can push everyone around.
You don't need this.
(SOFTLY) I understand.
Junior high must have been kind of tough,
but it doesn't give you the right to treat your workers like horseshit, Janice.
I know we laugh at you, Janice.
We all know you keep your stash of jelly donuts in the top drawer of your desk.
But I want you to know
if you weren't such a bitch, we'd feel sorry for you.
I do feel sorry for you.
But as it stands, the way you behave,
I feel I can speak for the entire office
when I tell you
go fuck yourself.
Yeah. That was great, bro. Who's the man?
I'm the man.
That's a bad idea.
Couldn't find your keys, huh?
That could be handy. You going to teach me that?
I might need that.
So, Fox, right? What is that? Is that a call sign?
Is it like Maverick in  Top Gun?
You could tell me, but you'd have to kill me?
(LAUGHING) I'm just kidding.
SLOAN: Peter!
Check the shuttle rotation on this STB. It should be 300 per minute.
This kind of cotton weave, the opposing thread count should be 4,000.
Hey, this is pretty awesome, huh?
Is it a front?
Front for what? I don't know.
Assassinations.
You may think this is a front for something,
all I can tell you is this is a textile mill.
And George... George, go help Peter up there.
Yeah.
This is a textile mill.
And a damn good one.
WESLEY: Yeah, that's cute, but that's bullshit, right?
I mean, all these guys are killers, aren't they?
I think you owe me some answers.
All right. Clearly I don't understand,
All right. Clearly I don't understand, but do you make sweaters or do you kill people?
That's an awful lot of questions over coffee.
Are you sure you're ready for the answers?
Yes, I'm sure.
I can't go back.
Not to my life.
SLOAN: He's all yours.
All right. We're up.
How you doing?
I'm The Repairman.
What do you repair?
A lifetime of bad habits.
Would you do me a favor? Okay.
Just put your arms behind your back. Uh...
I don't know... It's okay.
Just behind your back. Is this okay?
REPAIRMAN: Just relax.
WESLEY: Is this part of it?
REPAIRMAN: There we go.
You going to put a bag over my head? REPAIRMAN: No. There's no need for a bag.
That's not too tight, is it? No, that's nice.
Why did you come here, Wesley?
Well, you brought me here, remember?
(GROANING) What the fuck did you do that...
How many punches did The Repairman throw before he was counting sheep?
Well, I haven't spent a lot of time having my face smashed in before, all right?
Did you spend a lot of time with knives? At breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Fuck.
It was a rhetorical question,  culo.
You interrupt me again, I use the business end.
Here's what you need to know,  puto.
Knives are easy to hide.
They don't jam and they never run out of bullets. (COUGHS)
They come in handy
when you have to do some close contact work.
What the fuck, man?
Come here. Come here. What?
WESLEY: What? BUTCHER: Now, try to cut me.
Try to cut me. Hey!
Just stick me with that... Be careful with that. That's sharp.
Why? Just stick and stick and stick.
Seriously, man, I could hurt you. Hey!
Okay, pussy.
I'm not a pussy. You're a pussy.
No, I'm not a pussy. You're a pussy!
I'm not a pussy. I got a healthy respect for the human condition.
I'm not a pussy! Fuck that, you pussy!
I'm not a pussy! You're a pussy!
I'm not a pussy! Come on, pussy.
Hi. How you doing?
What the fuck?
The fuck!
(HUSHING) Just a moment. Just a moment.
Sorry.
Hello? Hey!
Hey, come back! Hey!
You must drink. Drink. Yeah.
What is this? This is the recovery room.
This bath stimulates white blood cells and speed up the process.
In here, bruises, cuts, breaks heal in hours, not days.
You shitting me? Shh.
What is that? Vodka? Yeah.
Are you Russian? Yeah.
Get up.
This is The Gunsmith.
He knows more about a piece than anybody, and he's gonna teach you how to use one.
Pretty good. How you doing?
You know that Seltzer broke his leg? FOX: Oh, really?
Yeah, in three places.
FOX: How'd he do that? GUNSMITH: Jumped off a building.
So, is he okay? Yeah. It's pretty bad, though.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you guys, that is so realistic.
He's been in recovery for, like, three days now,
and they say they're not even gonna let him out.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Hey, we can't shoot a dead woman! She might be somebody's mom... (GUN FIRES)
You need to know what it's like to put a bullet in a body.
FOX: Why are you here?
You know, I thought I was learning to be some kind of super assassin.
You know, if I wanted to get beat up,
I would have stayed in my cubicle, you know.
Fuck.
FOX: All right, shoot the target.
From there.
You want me shoot through Wilbur? I want you to curve the bullet.
How am I suppose to do that?
It's not a question of how,
it's a question of what.
If no one told you that bullets flew straight
and I gave you a gun and told you to hit the target,
what would you do?
Let your instincts guide you.
How the hell did he do that?
Can you do that? Can you do that? Hello?
Hey, I think that's my old train.
Still is.
Shit! You fucking asshole!
Come on!
Let's go.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, God, I feel... I feel... I feel...
I feel kind of good.
GUNSMITH: He got Rictus. Perfect shot. Impossible angle.
Cross is taking us out one by one.
And Wesley is the only one who can get to him.
Cross gets closer with each hour.
Get back to work.
FOX: See that?
Okay. It's a shuttle.
I want you to try and catch it.
You want me to stick my hand in there?
Yes. I want you to catch it.
You wanna put a gun to my head?
I can just slow things down like with the flies.
You need to learn to control that by yourself.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
This is bullshit! Fuck this!
How's it going today, Wesley?
No. Fuck the loom and fuck The Repairman!
I can shoot the wings off the back of a fly! I'm ready!
You're ready when Fox says you're ready.
Who put her in charge? I did.
Wesley.
People think you use cheese to catch these beauties.
But they go apeshit for peanut butter.
Your father was a big fan of this. Watch. (WATCH BEEPING)
Plastic explosive and peanut butter!
Sorry, Mickey.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Hey. Hey, Russian.
Good for one. Yeah.
Imagine if you had a thousand.
They really fucked you up, didn't they?
What the hell did they do to you?
Throw you in front of a moving train for no reason? (WHISTLING)
Beat the shit out of you?
You know, you can say it, this place is bullshit. It's bullshit, huh?
Bullshit!
Repairman. Five minutes.
Heads up out of the question?
Fuck.
You're a waste of my fucking time! Why are you here?
I don't know, so hit me.
I had a shit life, so why wouldn't I? Why are you here?
I wanna kick your fucking ass!
Tell me what you want me to say.
I don't know! FOX: Why are you here?
Why are you here?
I don't know why I'm here. Why are you here?
Why are you here?
Why are you here?
I don't know who I am.
What did you say? I said...
I said I don't know who I am.
Do you really want to know who you are?
Yeah. It's my room.
No.
This was your father's room.
WESLEY: What happened?
A member of this fraternity went rogue.
Cross.
He started by killing the one man who was better than him.
Your father.
Blindsided him on a rooftop.
Betrayed him.
Everything in this room,
books, weapons, clothes,
belonged to him.
Now they belong to you.
Find a connection in this room, Wesley.
It may be the only way of finding out who you are.
WESLEY: Now I know why I could never care about anything before this.
I was living a lie.
Finally, I have a chance to step into my father's shoes.
Grow a pair. Live the life I was born to live.
I've been pissing it all away like it was another fucking billing report.
I have to train harder.
I have to be as good as my father.
On these shelves, Wesley, are the records of the Fraternity kills,
everything you will need to kill your target.
WESLEY: To kill Cross,
the man who betrayed the Fraternity and murdered my father, I must prepare.
I have to become his student, memorize every move he ever made,
every attack he ever executed.
When he dropped a patient in an airtight room surrounded by Secret Service agents.
When he took out that businessman in the elevator.
His bullets untraceable, of course.
Or how no matter what the weapon or how he eliminated his target,
he was always one chess move ahead.
One move more prepared.
One step quicker.
One shot more precise.
In fact, in all my research, I found that he never missed a target.
Not until me.
Yeah!
First time in your life, Wesley, you're in control.
Shoot the target.
You're crazy.
Welcome to the Fraternity.
SLOAN: We call this the Loom of Fate.
After today, you will never set foot in here again.
Why not?
Because, like an apostle,
your task is not to interpret, but to deliver.
Every culture in history has a secret code,
one you won't find in traditional texts.
A thousand years ago,
a clan of weavers discovered a mystical language hidden in the fabric.
They called themselves the Fraternity.
I'll be honest with you, all I see are threads.
Come here.
Look there.
Do you see that one thread that missed the weave
and lies on top of the others?
Like a mistake? No, it's a code.
If the vertical thread is on top, it's a one.
If it's below, it's a zero.
Binary code?
What does it say?
It's a name.
A target.
Where do the names come from?
Come out of a necessity, Wesley.
A necessity to maintain balance in the world.
They are orders that must be executed,
entrusted to us so that we might forge stability out of chaos.
This one is yours.
I don't...
Look, I thought you brought me here to kill Cross.
You will.
In time.
This is your first assignment.
The loom provides,
I interpret,
you deliver.
You want me to kill Robert Deane Darden?
Not me.
Fate.
FOX: The target will be in the conference room, sitting at the head chair.
There are six windows.
You will shoot through the fifth.
Fifth window.
Now.
WESLEY: What did he do that he deserves to die?
You don't know.
I don't know if he was bad, I don't know if he was evil.
I don't know anything about him.
We get our orders from a loom.
Fate.
And we're suppose to take it on faith that what we're doing is right.
Killing someone we know nothing about,
I don't know if I can do that.
About 20 years ago,
there was this girl.
Her dad was a federal judge,
so she probably had it in her mind that she was gonna follow in his footsteps.
So she's home one Christmas,
and her dad's on this big racketeering case.
The defendants want to get a softer judge.
One they can buy off.
So they hire this guy,
Max Petridge,
get him to pay her father a visit.
And the way he pays people a visit
is to break in
(INAUDIBLE)
and tie up their loved ones,
and force them to watch
while he burns his targets alive.
And then he takes a wire hanger and twists it round
and brands his initials into each one of them so they will never ever forget.
After I was recruited into the Fraternity,
I found out that Max Petridge's name had come up
weeks before the federal judge was killed,
and that a Fraternity member had failed to pull the trigger.
We don't know how far the ripples of our decisions go.
You kill one, and maybe,
save a thousand.
That's the code of the Fraternity.
That's what we believe in, and that's why we do it.
Now!
Cross.
Not yet.
FOX: Your target will be in a black limo.
He always travels the same six blocks of Halsted.
You have three blocks to kill him. (HONKING)
Shit.
I'm sorry.
CATHY: Barry! Could you feed Annabelle?
Barry!
Wesley. Hey, where have you been? I have really missed you, man.
Look at the big man. You fucking asshole! What?
What? You don't show up for weeks,
now you're just gonna stop by and use the bathroom?
You think you're a real big shot now, huh?
No. You know what? You are nothing!
No, you are less than nothing.
You're not even half the man that Barry is.
Barry, he pleases me in ways that you've never even heard of!
Who the hell is she, Wesley? Your new whore?
Is that what it takes now? You're paying for it?
Wesley?
He's the man.
Yeah. You all right?
Yeah. I'm okay. Go sit down. I'm gonna find a car.
Big night. I got to get into recovery.
Shit.
Fuck!
Bull's-eye.
REPAIRMAN: What's he doing here?
Come on. Just stay with us. Come on!
FOX: Pull back his jacket.
REPAIRMAN: Breathe. Breathe, all right?
FOX: It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
A thousand.
REPAIRMAN: Come on!
Come on! FOX: No! No! Stay with us.
GUNSMITH: Open your eyes! Come on.
REPAIRMAN: Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
This bullet is the first traceable bullet he's ever used.
It was made by this man. His name is Pekwarsky.
He works out of what is now a monastery in Eastern Moravia.
This place is where the Fraternity was born.
He's taunting me.
He's sending me a message.
I'm gonna send him one back.
He's trapping you.
Leading you to a place he knows very well.
Look, I know this. I...
This is what you trained me for.
You can't go alone.
I go alone or he doesn't show. He's not stupid.
Look, a member of the Fraternity is dead because of me.
SLOAN: Okay.
Go.
Thank you.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Your next assignment.
Pekwarsky?
WESLEY: Shit.
What are you doing here?
(GUN COCKING) FOX: Lower your gun.
WESLEY: You recognize this?
I pulled this out of my shoulder.
The guy who put it there killed my father.
Now, I know you made it, so tell me where he is.
I did mold this, but I can't be responsible for the people who use them.
I don't give a shit. Tell me where he is.
Look at my finger.
I can try and arrange a meet.
Have you ever thought about doing things differently?
How do you mean?
I don't know.
Being somebody else.
Somebody normal.
No.
Shit.
Out of the way!
Stay.
Hey!
He's on the train.
He's alone.
Thank you.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Sit down!
Sir, sit down! Nobody's gonna get hurt.
Sir, sit... Sit down! Sir, sit down!
Get out of the way! Sit down! Stay down! Stay down!
Stay down! It's okay! Sit down!
(WHISPERING) Wesley.
Out of the way! Out of the way!
WESLEY: No, no, no!
Wesley, listen to me.
Shut the fuck up!
You don't get to talk to me.
You don't get to talk to me.
Everything they told you was a lie.
Shut up, you lying piece of shit. You shut the fuck up.
You are my son. (GASPING)
What did you say?
What did you say to me?
Is it true?
Yes.
Why did you make me do this?
Because you are the only person he wouldn't kill.
You knew, God damn it.
You knew the entire time.
Well, his name came up.
So did yours.
No, it was okay. Never mind.
No. No, it was complete shit.
I promised your father I'd bring you back here.
What the fuck?
He said it was the only way you'd believe.
Your father was never more than a camera click away.
That's me.
He was my father.
And I killed him.
To your father, protecting you was worth giving up his life.
Protect me?
He was trying to fucking kill me!
No. He wasn't trying to kill you.
He was trying to rescue you.
PEKWARSKY: When Cross left the Fraternity,
Sloan hunted you down.
Ever since Fox had her teeth in you, he's been trying to separate you from them.
Your father never wanted you in the Fraternity, Wesley.
He wanted a different path for you,
with things that he could never have.
A home.
Peace. No.
He hoped you would find your own way.
Your father got hold of this.
Decipher it yourself.
Sloan began manufacturing targets of his own for profit years ago.
Your father found out about it.
And he was going to do something about it on his own, right?
But Sloan turned everyone against him.
My father's name never even came up, did it?
No. Holding to the code made him a target.
Yes.
No. You want me to run?
I want you to live.
You can have a different life, Wesley.
Like your father wanted for you.
We trained him well.
WESLEY: My father was wrong about one thing.
Everything they told me wasn't a lie.
They taught me how to kill, how to feel no pain,
and most importantly, that every job has a perfect weapon.
Well, I'm the perfect weapon.
And I'm supposed to run?
No, I've been doing that my entire life.
So I say no.
I say kill them all and let fate sort out the mess.
Kill him.
He's here!
BUTCHER: Pussy.
Pussy, pussy.
Pussy, pussy.
Pussy.
Sloan!
My father wasn't a traitor.
This is a kill order.
And it's got Sloan's name on it.
What did you say to me?
It's a name. It's a target.
I don't want this person dead.
Fate does.
(LAUGHS) Fate wanted you dead.
And he couldn't take it.
So he started manufacturing his own targets for his own gains.
And that's when my dad found out and decided to stand against him.
And that's when you sent a man's son
to kill his father.
You're not an assassin of fate, Sloan.
You're just a thug who can bend bullets.
Is that true?
Here is what the truth is.
Your name came up.
Your name came up.
Your name came up.
Your name.
Your name.
Yours.
Everyone in this room.
If I had not done what I did,
you would all be dead.
I saved your lives.
Now look where we are. We are stronger than ever.
Changing the course of history as we see it.
Choosing the targets we select.
We can redistribute power where we see fit.
The wolves rule.
Not the sheep.
Now, if any of you feel the need to follow the code
of the Fraternity to the letter,
I invite you to take your gun,
put it in your mouth and pull the trigger.
That is what Wesley demands.
Otherwise,
shoot this motherfucker
and let us take our Fraternity of Assassins to heights
reserved only for the gods of men.
You choose.
Fuck the code.
Sloan!
Sloan! (HEART BEATING SLOWER)
WESLEY: Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and pathetic.
Just like you.
But who am I now?
Account manager?
Assassin?
Or just another tool who was mind-fucked into killing his father?
I am all of these.
And I am none of these.
Who am I now?
This is not me fulfilling my destiny. (PEOPLE CHATTERING)
This is not me following in my father's footsteps.
This is definitely not me saving the world.
Still trying to figure out who you are?
WESLEY: This is not me.
This is just a motherfucking decoy.
Oh, fuck.
This is me taking control.
From Sloan,
from the Fraternity,
from Janice, from billing reports,
from ergonomic keyboards,
from cheating girlfriends and sack-of-shit best friends.
This is me taking back control
-[Arjun] Who? -[Sachin] Amit sir.
That's epic! Good!
Go over and tell her who you are and get her one coffee.
No, I don't have money for it.
-I'll pay for the coffee. Please? -[Arjun] He'll pay for it.
She's looking at you. She's blushing.
She's blushing. Dude, she wants you.
-Go over and talk -No, no, no.
-That's Ovi, though. -Isn't that hilarious?
No! No!
[in Hindi] Where have you been?
[in English] With friends.
[in Hindi] Hasn't your father told you to come straight home after school?
[Saju in English] Okay.
I'm gonna come back.
Hey.
Hey! What's up? He talk to her yet?
Did you talk to her yet?
No.
Did he talk to... Come on, Ovi. You gotta go talk to her.
Oh, she's smiling.
I know what you need. Come on.
Try it. Take one hit, man, it'll help you.
[officer in Hindi] Having fun tonight, boys?
I think you dropped something, no?
No?
Did you buy this inside?
-No, it's not ours. -[in English] Chill. Relax.
[in Hindi] It's all good.
You boys are lucky.
You got your whole lives ahead of you.
[in English] No!
[guard 1 in Hindi] You all leave.
[guard 2] Leave. Move fast.
[in Hindi] I told you, you dumb motherfucker,
to watch his every move...
...and yet Amir Asif has grabbed my son.
We can negotiate.
This isn't about ransom, Saju.
It's about humiliation.
Go to Dhaka.
And do what?
Steal him back.
I'd need an army, Ovi.
Then hire a fucking army!
What do you think?
You think I can't hurt you from here?
Ovi, please...
You want your son to see his next birthday?
Then...
get mine back.
[in Hindi] Tell Mahajan to pay the ransom and get his son back.
Why are they getting us involved in this?
Neysa...
There's not enough money.
The NCB have frozen Mahajan's assets.
[in English] I'm all he's got.
You understand?
Animals!
[in Hindi] There's a man who does this sort of thing.
His price will be out of Mahajan's reach.
But there's a way I can play this.
It will not be easy.
Do whatever you have to.
[in English] Christ! That is high.
[Koen] It's only 30 meters.
[Rata] Fuckin' high.
It's fuckin' beautiful, though.
[Rata] He okay?
[Koen] He's fine.
[Rata] You sure, bruh? 'Cause he looks fuckin' dead.
Quit swearin' all the time.
-So? -It makes you sound stupid.
Find another fuckin' adjective.
Told you he's fine.
-Hold my beer, would you? -Oh, I gotcha.
-I said hold it. Don't drink it. -[Koen] I gotcha.
-Christ! -[Koen laughs]
Come here, girl.
Hey.
[Tyler] Make yourself at home.
There's a chicken in your bathroom.
Yeah, I like chickens, except when they shit everywhere.
We landed the whale.
Oh, yeah? Extraction. Indian kid. Drug lord's son.
Extraction. Indian kid. Drug lord's son.
A rival gangster is holding this kid in Dhaka.
I think Gaspar lives in Dhaka.
Gaspar is out of the game.
Clock's running at 16 hours. Deadline, Friday, noon.
Proof of life as of six hours ago.
Yeah, I'll take it.
This gangster, Amir Asif, he holds a massive sway in Dhaka.
You get your hands on this kid, it's gonna get complicated.
It's always fuckin' complicated, innit?
This was a mistake.
Nik, what are you doing here? Don't bullshit yourself.
No one else is gonna commit to somethin' this fucked up.
And why would you?
I need the money.
Chickens aren't cheap.
You're hoping if you spin the chamber enough times,
you're gonna catch a bullet.
Tomorrow morning, I'll meet you in Fitzroy Crossing.
If you're not sober, don't show up.
What's his name?
Ovi. Ovi Mahajan.
Head on straight, Tyler.
[Yaz] This is our extract. Ovi Mahajan, 14 years old.
His father, Ovi Mahajan Senior, is in jail.
So, his people employed us to get the boy back,
and they refuse to negotiate.
What about our opposition?
[Yaz] Amir Asif. Dhaka's very own Pablo Escobar.
Biggest drug lord in India versus biggest drug lord in Bangladesh.
Sounds like some mythic shit.
[Yaz] A lot of bad blood between them.
This is our extraction point. So, José and Thiago will man a boat,
ferry you and the kid nine miles down the river to a chopper.
-Any questions? -How many hostiles on site?
[Yaz] Maybe 20. Okay, clock is ticking. Let's chop-chop!
[Kalam] You see the laundry across the street?
[Tyler] Yep. [Kalam] Walk to it.
Now what?
Welcome to Dhaka.
Proof.
Money.
Proof.
Show me proof.
Money!
[in English] You show me the kid's all right, I tell my people, they pay you.
-Do you under-- -[all laugh]
Fuck... come here. [exclaims]
Listen, you boys seem like real busy professionals,
so let's say we cut this shit and get down to business, yeah?
Okay.
[in Bengali] Bastard!
Didn't even blink!
[in English] Hey, man, you're crazy or what?
-There's no magazine in it. -[Kalam chuckles]
Enough talk.
Let's get to business.
[Kalam in Bengali] Come on, boy!
Show me your face.
Beautiful!
[in English] Good night!
[Ovi] No. No.
[Kalam] Now you go.
Tell them. Pay.
If not?
I take this...
stick in his ass and blow his insides out.
[in Bengali] Move it!
Let's go!
[Ovi] No! No! No! No! No! Shh!
Who are you?
-Can you walk? -Yeah.
All right. Put this on.
No! No, Amir, no! Amir, no! [screams]
Sons of bitches.
Anybody feel like they remember now?
[Farhad] Wait!
I know...
I know who took the money. Who?
-Sanjib. -Who's Sanjib?
You just threw him off the roof.
Come here.
What's your name?
Farhad.
Farhad?
You're pretty clever.
Pay attention...
and learn...
that's how you survive.
You need to be smart. Use your wits.
Eh, Farhad?
Cut off two of your fingers.
Any two.
Why?
Because the kid who stole from me is dead.
And I'd like a walking reminder
of what happens when you touch my money.
I'd recommend the left hand.
So you can still hold a gun.
[colonel] Amir!
I am talking!
Amir, we lost the kid.
Clever and lucky...
Close the city.
Bridges, trains, airports...
Close everything.
Impossible, Amir.
Make it possible, Colonel,
or you'll lose more than just a finger.
[in English] Get out. Let's go.
Here. Hey.
Kid, you wanna survive, you do exactly as I say.
Here. Put these on.
Here. Eat this. Your blood sugar is low, that's why you feel like shit.
Twenty-one hundred meters out. In possession.
[Nik on radio] Copy. Alpha team is with the boat. In position.
All right. Arms up.
-[recorder beeps] -Okay. All right. Name?
Say your name, mate.
Say your bloody name, come on.
-Ovi. -Last name?
Mahajan.
Your birthday?
21st of January, 2005.
Proceeding to extraction. Let's go.
Satellite's online. Rake and the kid are on route.
You good?
Good.
[Tyler on radio] You guys ready for us? We're 1,600 meters out.
Ready and waiting.
[Tyler] Copy. See you soon.
-[Tyler on video] Last name? -Mahajan.
-Your birthday? -21st of January, 2005.
[Yaz] Sending proof of possession.
You have seven minutes to transfer the funds.
It's G. I'm in position.
[Thiago on radio] There's an alarm going off in the engine room.
-G, I need you to be my eyes. -Copy that.
[colonel in Bengali] Blockades have been set up on every bridge into and out of Dhaka.
I have teams combing the Buriganga as we speak.
We'll find them, sir.
I like this one.
Get him a gun. Put his fingers to work.
[Ovi in English] I... I can't breathe.
-Deep breath, mate. Deep breath. -[panting]
Yeah, we gotta keep moving. Come on.
Rake's about five minutes from the boat.
Where are we at with the transfer?
Where is it?
-I don't know. -Well, try it again.
-Nada. -Fuckin' shit.
Call them back. Tell them they have 60 seconds to make the transfer.
Or they'll find Ovi's body floating in the Buriganga.
We're getting played.
-Give me verbal. -[G on radio] G here.
Thiago?
-Thiago? -Shit.
[Nik on radio] Thiago?
Tyler, something's wrong. Hold your position.
Holding.
G, you got eyes on the boat?
I'm looking at it right now. Our boys haven't come up yet.
I'm moving in for a closer look.
[in Bengali] Colonel, stand by. We think we found something.
-Nik, you're gonna wanna see this. -What is it?
Shit!
Tyler, two inbound police boats.
-Two hundred meters and closing in fast. -G?
There's someone else in those woods.
About a hundred meters out and closing in on your position.
Kid... Move fast. Stay low. Go!
They found the boat.
[man in Bengali] We need air support by the river.
They're in the forest.
Tyler, chopper's inbound.
[Tyler] Go, go!
Down.
[in Hindi] Ovi, it's Saju!
I'm here to take you home!
-[in English] Saju, I'm here! -Sit down and shut up!
[in English] I need the boy! I won't hurt him!
When I tell you to, run like hell or I'm gonna kill you both. Understand?
Go!
Okay, go!
Go on, kid. Go, go! Go! Come on.
-[Saju] Ovi! -[Tyler] Move, boy!
-Here, get in the car. Get in the car. -[Saju] Stop running!
-[officers shouting] -[car accelerates]
-[guns firing] -[Tyler] Get down!
[Ovi] Saju! Help!
Hey! Hey!
Please let me go! Saju works for my father.
I work for your father. But something is fucked here.
Saju could have a deal with the men who grabbed you and send you back to them.
-Then take me to the police. -The cops are in on it.
Look, if you wanna live, you have to trust me.
I need eyes. Radio's compromised. Call my sat.
[Nik on phone] Turn right, after the bridge.
-[Tyler] How far past the gate? -What gate?
-Turn right. -Can't. Bloody truck is in the way.
[Nik] Tyler, on your right.
Fuck off!
[Nik on phone] Up ahead, make a left.
No, no, no! Left! You just passed it.
[Tyler] For fuck's sake!
Get down!
I'm in survival mode.
-Put your belt on. -What belt?
Your fucking seat belt.
It's been on. You drive like you're insane!
[Tyler] Hold tight.
-You okay, kid? -[Ovi] I'm fine.
[Tyler] We gotta move. Go. Up the stairs.
[officer 1 in Bengali] Go, go, go!
[whispering] Come on. Come on.
Move!
-[in Bengali] Help! Help! Help! -[woman exclaims]
-[officer in Bengali] Come here. -[Ovi groaning]
Come here, you little shit--
[Tyler] Run, go.
Get up the stairs. Go. Come on. Move!
[whispering] Get down.
All right, kid. Do you trust me?
-No. -Good.
-No! -[grunts]
Get up, kid.
Okay! [exclaims]
Stay on my shoulder, all right?
Fuck.
[in English] Let me go!
Help!
Are you hurt?
Get in, kid. Come on. Come on!
-You hit him with the truck. -Yeah.
[Ovi] They're still following us.
[Tyler] Hold on.
All right, kid. I need you to slide on over here.
Okay, we're gonna jump on three. All right?
-What? -One...
[man in Bengali over radio] The vehicle crashed. It flipped over and is in flames.
I want to see the bodies.
We're coming.
[in Bengali] They're still alive.
One is seriously injured.
I want every gun in Dhaka pointed at this guy.
All right. Close the door. Close it.
Can you give me a hand?
I need a hand. Hold that on there.
Just hook it through there and then pull it back this way.
Yeah.
Yep.
-Yeah? -Yeah, I got it.
Yeah?
[Nik on phone] Our new friend is Saju Rav. Ex-Special Forces.
He works for the kid's father.
We were played.
Second transfer never came through.
Mahajan got us to do the heavy lifting and he doesn't wanna pay.
What about G?
[Nik] The whole team is dead.
Shit.
-City's on lockdown. You got cover? -Yeah.
And the kid?
He's with me.
There's a clearing on east side of Sultana Kamal Bridge,
just outside the city. We can send a chopper and get you out.
-How far? -Four kilometers.
You gotta leave the kid behind, Tyler.
Tyler?
Tyler?
That's not the job.
The job is fucked.
Just find my money, Nik.
[Ovi] Are you gonna leave me in the street?
Your phone... It's loud.
The only chance of getting my money is you, mate. So... no.
I'm like a package then.
Yeah, pretty much.
In brown paper.
What are you doing?
This?
Piano. I play the piano when I'm nervous.
It helps.
My father hates it when I do it.
He thinks of me the same way you do.
More like a thing than a person.
I didn't... I didn't mean it like that.
It's okay.
Sir.
Saju?
[Saju in English] Hey, beautiful.
[Neysa in Hindi] Are you okay?
[Saju in Hindi] Listen to me carefully.
If you don't hear from me in the next 12 hours...
take the cash and go.
Disappear.
[Neysa] I understand.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Just tired.
[in English] I love you.
I love you, too.
Put Aarav on the phone.
[Neysa in Hindi] Aarav, Papa's on the phone.
Sadia.
[in English] Hello, Papa.
Hey, champ.
[in Hindi] Are you coming home soon?
Yes, it'll be very soon.
When?
When you wake up in the morning.
You help your mother, okay?
Yes, Papa, I will.
[in English] I love you.
Always.
I love you too, Papa.
Bye.
Yeah.
[Nik] You got a chopper. Meet you at the east side of the bridge.
Copy. I'm on the move.
Kid. Kid. Hey, come on.
Get in. Come here.
Come on, you bastard.
Get out of the car.
Go, go, go, go, go!
-Stay there! -Yeah.
-[in Bengali] Hey, this guy wants my gun! -My ankle is broken!
[boy] Leave my gun.
Leave it!
My friend is gonna shoot you!
Hey! Give me my gun... Give it back!
That's my gun, give it back to me!
-Give it back or I'll blow you away! -[Farhad] I will finish you off.
The fuck?
[in Bengali] Son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!
I'll murder you.
-[grunts] -Piss off!
Fucking shits.
[officer over megaphone] You are surrounded. Please surrender...
-[officer continues indistinctly] -Fuck! Come on. We gotta move.
[over megaphone] Stop or we will have to shoot.
Go, go, go, go, go!
[Tyler] All right. Get in.
[Nik] Talk to me.
-Call Gaspar. -What's going on?
We just got attacked by the goonies from hell. We made it about four blocks.
I said get rid of the kid.
I don't give a shit what you said.
We're in the worst smelling sewer on the planet.
There's about 200 cops over our heads. Just call Gaspar.
Tyler, I don't think that's a good idea.
The guy owes me his life, Nik.
-Tyler, I-- -Call him.
Your name's Tyler?
I'm Ovi.
Nice to meet ya.
[Gaspar] Ugh, Jesus Christ!
[Gaspar] Hey, how's it going?
Yeah, better after the shower.
Cheers.
Good to see you, man.
I appreciate you coming for us.
What the hell is wrong with you? Don't insult me.
-You hungry? -Yeah.
Hey, how's that kid?
Uh, he's resting.
So, where are we?
We are south of the city center.
I told Nik that an extraction is... It's not feasible.
Well, you know, the city is surrounded by rivers.
There are bridges going in and out.
But every one of those bridges currently is blocked by a roadblock
because you are a very popular individual.
I figure we lie low a couple days, we let the panic dissipate.
And we'll get you going. Now, my wife made that.
So, I want you to be very careful what you say.
Your wife?
And what's that for, the knee?
Yeah, knee, back, shoulder...
Hang on one sec... my knee. Ow! Oh, God. Oh, it hurts.
Two oughta do it.
Okay. I gotta go. I gotta go.
I gotta kiss my wife.
But you stay here and rest up. And I will be back.
It's good to see you, man. I missed you.
[in Bengali] Don't you see I'm eating?
-[Farhad] I had him... -[Asif] Had who?
The man you want.
I lost him...
near the market.
Tell them to scour the market.
[Shadek] Yes, sir.
-What is this? -A gift.
When you catch him,
I want to be the one to pull the trigger.
If you let me do that,
I'll give you the other finger!
He made me feel like a fool.
Of course he did.
You're only a kid. Hmm?
Here's some advice, a gift.
Keep your other finger.
Because no matter how badass you think you are...
there's always a badass who's bigger than you.
[Ovi] Tyler.
Yeah?
If you had been killed today, it would have been my fault.
No, mate. But it would've been my fault.
You don't look like a Tyler.
No?
What do I look like?
A Brad.
Yeah.
Can I ask you something?
It's Rake.
-What's Rake? -My last name.
That's not what I was going to ask. That's a strange last name, though.
Isn't that like a gardening tool?
What were you gonna ask me?
If you were always this way. You know... brave.
I'm not brave, mate.
Of course you are. You rescue people.
Yeah, sometimes. Sometimes I do other things.
Like killing people?
Yeah.
My father, he kills people, too.
Sometimes, I would sit with him at dinner, look at him and think,
he just killed somebody else's father that day.
And I'd feel sick.
You have a family?
I did have me a wife.
Where is she?
I don't know. I haven't seen her in a long time.
Children?
Yeah, a son.
Where is he?
He died a few years ago.
How did he die?
Lymphoma.
How old was he?
Six.
I wasn't even there... when he died.
Where were you?
Kandahar, Afghanistan. It was my third tour.
You were called away?
No.
I left.
Voluntary.
Because you couldn't watch?
Yep.
I told you, mate. I'm not brave. I'm just...
I'm just the opposite.
You know...
"You drown not by falling into the river,
but by staying submerged in it."
Who told you that?
I read it in a book in school.
[in Spanish] Estancia Los Chanares.
-[in English] Yes. Yes! -[chuckles] I don't know...
It's the best dove hunting in Argentina.
Just lie in this pool... You lie in a pool and they fly around!
And you shoot them. [mimics gun firing]
And you sip a Cuba Libre.
I shot my first dove when I was ten years old. Have I told you this?
-I haven't. Listen. -I think you have.
No. It was when I was ten years old, my dad... My dad... The gun backfired,
gave me a black eye, and my dad laughs at me.
I used to move so quick, kill those little shits.
Not anymore, though.
It sucks getting old, man. Sucks! -[loudly] Getting old sucks. -Shh.
[softly] Sucks!
I think he's still asleep.
What a goddamn tragedy, hmm?
That kid is a walking corpse.
Asif will never let him live.
Think the disgrace.
I mean, you get him home. And then, what? His father's in prison.
There's no way to protect him.
You know, the best thing you could do, honestly,
would be to go up there right now and just go put a bullet in his brain.
Make it painless.
'Cause the animals out there, they're not gonna be... as kind to him.
They like to start with the ears.
Then they cut off each finger at the joint.
Mate, you're drunk.
I'm talking about mercy, Tyler.
You know how much he's worth?
We're talking about a kid, Gaspar.
We're talking about a gangster's kid.
With a price tag of ten million on his head.
You need to sober up, mate.
You're a mercenary, right, Tyler? Why don't you act the mercenary?
Aren't you sick of this life? 'Cause I am and I...
I do not wanna end it playing hero on some goddamn suicide mission--
What are you doing? You said you'd help me.
I am helping you. Ten million dollars.
I'll get you to the border in a couple hours.
It's money in your pocket. I take care of the body. Painless.
And it's the best that that kid can hope for.
-Did you call someone? Who'd you call? -[groans]
Why are you such a hypocrite? You've got the blood of a hundred men on your hands--
[grunts] Answer me!
[panting] Put your hands on me?
What'd you do?
Do you know happens to me if they find out that I'm helping you?
Do you know what happens to my wife?
Asif's a friend.
I did some work for him. We made a deal.
He gets the kid, you get your freedom, and we both get rich.
What do you want from me? You want me to walk upstairs and shoot him in the head?
No. No. I'll do it.
Don't do this.
You saved my life once.
Now I'm gonna save yours.
Step aside.
Tyler, stop!
What are we doing, man? Huh?
Come on, stay down.
Stay down.
Hey, kid.
I know it looks bad. I know it looks bad.
[shakily] I want to go home.
I'll get you home, mate.
I'll get you home.
[Tyler] I've got the boy. I need your help.
Stay here.
Just like that?
Yeah, just like that. I want the boy out of here. That's all I care about.
Why?
'Cause I do.
He was gonna kill my family if I didn't get his son back.
My people are waiting for him on the other side of the Sultana Kamal bridge.
There's two blockades between here and there.
I'll do my best to draw them away from both.
You get him to the other side.
Tyler.
See you soon, mate.
[Saju in Hindi] Let's go.
[in English] Come on.
Do you trust him?
I do.
Seat belt.
[in Hindi] We'll have to go on foot.
[in Bengali] Any sign of the boy?
[colonel] Not yet.
But we've seen our friend...
the kid must be near.
[officer 2 in English] Grenade!
Don't cross the bridge.
Hey! I'm telling you to stop!
-Take his hat off. Let me see his face. -Huh?
[in Hindi] I don't understand.
[in Bengali] His hat. Take it off.
[in Hindi] Do what he says.
-[officer 1] Move! Move! -[officer 2] Go, go, go!
[in English] Stay here.
[in Bengali] Take two more units to the bridge.
Two units to the bridge. Hurry!
Bring me my rifle!
[in English] Stay here. Stay down. I'm gonna draw them away from you.
Go.
Rake, I need you on the bridge!
Yeah, on my way.
Oh, sh--
Where's the kid?
[Saju over radio] In hiding. About halfway across the bridge.
I'm trying to clear a path.
Yaz, where are you?
Two minutes out.
Fuck! I'm taking fire. Abort. I'm going around.
You see that helicopter?
I need you to run as fast as you can for it.
No. Please. Please, get up.
[Yaz] Bogeys are down. LZ clear. Two-minute window.
Go.
You got this? You bet your ass, bubba.
Mmm. Let's make some money!
Everyone in position.
Well, I thought we'd be robbin' banks by now,
not some gas truck in the middle of nowhere.
not some gas truck in the middle of nowhere. Down here gas is gold, bubba.

Ha! Liquid gold. Ha-ha!
- We're clear. - Okay, T. You're up.
Let's see if you can get it under six tries this time, huh, T.?
It's more like three. Come on, Tego. Keep it real.
There's one "K" left. We're running out of road. Get in there, brother. Got it. I got it.
Get in there, brother. Got it. I got it.
Oh, shit!
T., cut loose! Unhitch! Unhitch!
- [ Screams ] - [ Mutters ]
- Spray that hitch! - I don't have a hammer!
Just do it!
- Hold on! Hold on! - No shit!
Hold on to something tight!
Letty! Give me your hand!
Letty! Give me your hand! I can't reach! You gotta jump!
I can't reach! You gotta jump!
Jump!
Letty, jump!
I got you!
Dom.
Dom?
Dom!
- Oye, oye, oye, oye. - Hold it.
[ Spanish ] How you doin'?
Money, money!
Good.
- Yo, why your stack is bigger than mine always? - There you go.
, ¿eh? - No, I'm supersized, baby. - Y tú qu
[ Spanish ] Okay. Hey, hey, man. Thank you.
Cops just raided our garage in Baracoa.
They're real interested in you.
Heat's on, and we just sent up a flare that's gonna lead 'em right to us.
I say we move out first thing in the morning.
Nah, it's me they want.
And if they catch me, they're throwin' big numbers at anybody with me.
Han, we had a good run.
Time for you to go do your own thing.
Heard they're doin' some crazy shit in Tokyo.
You seen Letty?
There she is.
I hear Rio is nice this time of year.
The cops are getting hungrier.
Then I guess we're doin' our job.
I'm a walking target.
I don't want you around when they catch up to me.
"Ride or die," remember?
Dom, how long have we been doing this?
And now all of a sudden, out of nowhere, it's too dangerous?
Come on.
We'll figure it out. We always do.
I don't know shit! I don't know shit, man! Give me a name!
David Park! David Park's the guy you want!
Please!
Oh, thank God. Listen, he's in a mood, because yesterday was his cheat day,
and then today some genius brought in doughnuts.
Oh, great.
Sorry I'm late. [ Door Closes ]
Complaints keep rolling in after your little downtown Olympics, O'Conner.
Tell me that reinstating you wasn't a mistake.
- [ Typing ] - I got a name. David Park.
That's it? That's all you got? David Park?
I could throw a fortune cookie out this window and hit 50 David Parks right now.
It's Korean, not Chinese. Whatever.
Park is a scout that recruits street racers to be mules for the Braga cartel.
We find Park, and we bust the bad guys.
Dímelo. Dom. Mia, I told you not to call me here.
Mia, I told you not to call me here.
Dom, it's Letty.
She's been murdered.
Brothers and sisters, we are gathered here to pay our final respects... to our beloved Letty. Let us reflect on her journey...
Facial recognition software matched Toretto...
about 10 minutes after he crossed the border.
I don't get it.
Thought he'd show.
I told you not to come. They're staking the place out.
If they find you-- They won't.
Aw, come on. Look at you.
Letty wouldn't let them junk it.
Even though it has a goddamn curse.
When she came back, she was always in here,
working on it day and night.
It was weird.
It was like she knew you were coming back.
I want to see the crash site.
I just got off the phone with Deputy Director Lawson.
If we don't make serious inroads into the Braga case in the next 72 hours, they're gonna shut us down.
they're gonna shut us down.
Well, I know I'm a newbie here, but why the clock now?
Because it's been two years,
and the last three agents we sent in to infiltrate his organization...
have come back in body bags.
have come back in body bags. He's moved more heroin across the border than Escobar did in 10 years.
This guy is becoming one of our biggest national threats,
and we don't even have a picture of him.
We don't have prints! Not even a goddamn D.O.B.
What's the status on David Park?
Isn't he our ticket into the Braga organization?
We're running the name through city and county databases, sorting the possibilities.
We've got over 500 already.
Park's insignificant. Sounds like another jerk-off to me.
It's not. Without Park, Braga wouldn't have drivers to move his shipments.
Cross-check traffic-- illegal modifications, street racing.
Cross-check traffic-- illegal modifications, street racing. This guy will definitely have a record. We'll find him.
We better.
Well, what do you know?
Your boy Toretto's red Chevelle's been spotted in his old neighborhood.
I'm gonna bring his ass in.
Not in your car you're not.
It's straight ahead.
You found something back there.
There were burn marks on the ground.
The kind that could only be caused by nitrometh.
There's only one guy in all of L.A. that sells that.
Nothing you can do is gonna bring her back, Dom.
If I were Letty, I would ask you-- no, I would beg you--
If I were Letty, I would ask you-- no, I would beg you-- please, let this go.
Before it's too late.
It's already too late.
I love you.
Miss Toretto.
I'm, uh, Michael Stasiak, F.B.I.
Let's you and I have a little chat.
Hi. This is Forsythe in Evidence.
I need Stasiak down here right away to sign some greenies.
Thanks. Hi.
Hey. So, I've narrowed it down to 50 or so David Parks.
What I'd like you to do is run the make and model on each one of 'em.
All right? Thank you. Okay. All right.
Hey, Tyler, we got a transfer.
You want to come with me?
Toretto. When'd you get back in town?
I'm lookin' for a car you did an engine mod on.
Nitromethane tank. Ford full size. Continental tires.
Okay, what are--What are you-- What are you doin', comin' in here like this, huh?
This ain't your scene anymore, boss.
Don't ever put your hands on me again, okay?
Say hi to your sister for me.
Korean kid brought it in. David Park.
It-- It's a green Ford Torino.
Please don't drop this on me.
I'm almost done.
Why don't you tell me why you dragged me here, Brian?
You know they're gonna capture Dom. Maybe worse.
I don't want you gettin' tangled up in this, so stay away from him.
That's what you have to say to me after five years?
All of a sudden you care what happens to me.
What I did to you was wrong.
I'm sorry. It was-- It was the hardest thing I ever had to do.
I'm sorry too, Brian.
I'm so sorry that you had to come into my home and pretend to love me.
I'm so sorry that you ripped my family apart.
I'm very sorry that that was hard for you.
I lied to you.
I lied to Dom. I lied to everybody.
That's what I do best. That's why the feds recruited me.
Maybe you're lying to yourself.
Maybe you're not the good guy pretending to be a bad guy.
Maybe you're the bad guy pretending to be the good guy.
You ever think about that?
Every day.
I always wondered--
Why'd you let my brother go that day?
I don't know.
[ Sighs ] Shit.
- [ Phone Ringing ] - [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Brian! I got the cross-checks on David Park back and have a list of possibles.
Brian! I got the cross-checks on David Park back and have a list of possibles.
What do you got?

No, no, no, no, no!
Green Torino, runnin' nitro.
Whose car? I don't know, man.
I'm just the middleman, I swear. I'm just the middleman!
Wait, wait, wait. [ Panting ]
I don't know shit, man. I swear. I just run cars for Braga. All right?
I just run cars for Braga. All right? - All I can do is get you in the race. That's all I can do. - What race?
- All I can do is get you in the race. That's all I can do. - What race?
Help! Come on, man! Let me up, man!
Help! Come on, man! Let me up, man! Come on!
Come on, man! I don't know shit! Just let me up!
- I-- I told you, you gotta talk to Braga! - Bring him up, Dom.
Oh, God! Don't drop me! That's all I know!
Bring him up. Yeah, listen to him!
Bring him up. Yeah, listen to him! - You gonna take me in, O'Conner? - Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
- You gonna take me in, O'Conner? - Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Shut up!
Letty was my friend too. You weren't anyone's friend.
Yo, can you guys talk about this later? Now pull my ass up!
She was running for this guy Braga, and things went bad.
Please! Oh, shit! I'm gonna get these guys, Dom.
Please! Oh, shit! I'm gonna get these guys, Dom. Now let me do my job and bring him up.
Now let me do my job and bring him up.
I'm gonna kill this Braga--
Oh, God!
and anyone else who gets in my way.
Don't let go.
O'Conner!
O'Conner! If you ever release a witness of mine again--
- Shit. - That's enough! - Don't touch me. I'm fine. - That's enough.
- Don't touch me. I'm fine. - That's enough.
- You're through, O'Conner! - I said, that's enough!
Stasiak, go get yourself cleaned up.
Wh-What? He hit me first! You-- You--
This isn't the Cub Scouts!
Now, go on! You're bleedin' on my floor.
O'Conner, do you know the difference between a cop and a criminal?
What? One bad judgment call.
Keep your shit in line, son.
Have a good time.
Take a seat.
Good news. We have intel that Braga's number two, Ramon Campos,
will hold a street race in Koreatown tomorrow night to fill a slot on his team.
They've already chosen three drivers from previous races.
Our newest informant, Mr. David Park, has been kind enough to get us into the race.
has been kind enough to get us into the race.
O'Conner, you're up.
Let me guess. Winner gets the slot.
All right. So these are all the imports the city has in impound.
Okay, nice. Pick your poison.
All right. Uh, 2206. I crashed one of those.
3418 and 2765.
Okay. So which one do you want?
I want 'em all.
Standard issue tracking device.
Boss wants to know where you are at all times.
You wanna play with this?
Hey! What you lookin' at, nutsack?
I don't know. You tell me.
Oh. The racer wants what Dwight's got.
See, but, ladies, Dwight's already on the team.
- 'Cause you gotta be fast if you wanna drive for Braga. - Is there a problem here?
- 'Cause you gotta be fast if you wanna drive for Braga. - Is there a problem here? No.
- You one of Park's guys, blondie? - Yeah. Yeah, I am.
Follow me.
See you later, punk.
You too, punk.
Bull's-eye, coño. Come on.
Oh! We could do this all day. Dame, dame, dame, dame, dame.
You all know why you're here?
Good drivers...
are a dime a dozen.
are a dime a dozen. Man, every corner's got a chingadera tuner racing for pinks.
That's not what Braga's got me looking for.
Braga wants someone that would sell their abuelita to be behind the wheel.
Someone that drives their 10-second cars not in a straight line,
but to push it and make it through places... no one else would take it.
Real drivers, ¿entiendes?
So, what are we haulin'?
Oye, for the money Braga's paying, you don't need to know.
You just said you wanted real drivers.
A real driver knows exactly what's in his car.
Mira. Real driver.
Nobody's forcing you to race. You the boss?
Or am I talkin' to the boss?
Do I look like a boss?
Papi. My job is to find the best drivers... period.
Whoever wins the race gets the info. We cool?
Are we cool?
Yeah, we're cool.
Uh, no, we ain't cool, man.
Uh, who's closing these streets?
[ Chuckling ] No one. That's the point.

At least we know you can't beat me straight up.

Papa Dwight wants you to take off your shoes.
Come on. Dwight likes feet. Take off your shoes.
So beautiful.

Hey, yo, stay, stay! Where you goin'?
Bye, Dwight. Yo, what did I do? Ow!
You're under arrest for distribution of meth.
Meth? Dwight's never touched that shit, bro!
- Dwight has now. - Yo, that ain't mine!
No, get off me! You know that's never gonna stick, right?
Ow! Yeah, it's not supposed to.
Live it up! Live it up!
Yeah. Corona.
That's too bad about Dwight.
Havin' the feds raid your house the same night you make the team.
That's unfortunate.
I wish I could say I was surprised to see you here.
What's to stop someone from tellin' them you're a cop?
Probably the same thing that's keeping me from tellin' 'em why you're really here.
What up, fellas? Hey, how you doin'?
Great. You havin' a good time?
Yeah, a great time. Come on. Let's have a better time.
How's your car? You took a nasty bump.
It'll be ready.
I also heard you just got out of County.
Yeah? Mm-hmm.
You know a guy named Jim Garcia?
Nah. Big place. Lots of names, lots of faces.
And you-- You're wanted by a lot of people, homes.
Man, that kinda heat can't be good for business.
Yeah, well, that depends on how you look at things.
I go down, I do time.
I do real time.
I don't know about your other drivers, but when I see flashing lights in my mirror, I don't stop.

To the ladies we've loved and the ladies we've lost. Salud. Salud.
So, what's Braga about?
You know, he's just one of us.
Came up from the streets. Down for el barrio.
Now he's a shot caller.
The boss of bosses.
See all these cats in here? Mm-hmm.
Any one of 'em would die for Braga.
Including you?
Especially me.
Enjoy the party, fellas. Club's yours.
Whatever you want-- booze, broads-- it's all good.
Braga's mine.
I'm taking the whole house down.
Good luck.
Something interest you about this car?
Just admiring the body work.
Are you one of those boys who prefers cars to women?
I'm one of those boys that appreciates a fine body regardless of the make.
Your car?
It's Fenix's car.
You met him at the rendezvous. He'll be leading you.
So now that I know your taste in cars,
tell me, what about your women?
Well, it starts with the eyes.
She's gotta have those kinda eyes... that can look right through the bullshit...
to the good in someone.
Twenty percent angel, 80% devil.
Down to earth.
Ain't afraid to get a little engine grease under her fingernails.
That doesn't sound anything like me.
It ain't.
Hi. Hey.
I got a gift for you. All right.
A dirty shot glass. Just what I always wanted. I got these from the club last night.
I got these from the club last night.
There's two sets of prints. Run 'em both. I know one of these is Campos's.
There's two sets of prints. Run 'em both. I know one of these is Campos's. I think the other might be Braga's.
And you're gonna have to go beyond Interpol.
So that means I have to contact individual agencies, and that could take weeks.
So that means I have to contact individual agencies, and that could take weeks. Okay. [ G.P.S. Ringing, Vibrating ]
Yeah?
That's your third traffic violation in less than three blocks.
Slow it down, O'Conner.
Sure thing, Dad.
He's stopped.
We lost him.
- He killed the tracker. - We don't know that.
- He killed the tracker. - We don't know that yet! Get the bird overhead.
[ Pilot ] Right now I'm moving north 33-56.
All clear. [ Man ] Move it up.
[ Pilot ] Base, Black Knight. I'm at Angels Five.
I don't have a tally on the target. Repeat: I don't have a tally on the target.
- They're gone. There's no one down there. - Damn it!
This ain't right, bro. [ Car Doors Close ] Nobody said nothin' about being locked in no truck. Tell me about it.
Nobody said nothin' about being locked in no truck. Tell me about it.
Hey. Hey!
Psst! Yo! Where you think they're takin' us?
Don't matter.
We're all just along for the ride now.
Welcome to Mexico, boys.
There are helicopters and surveillance cameras...
that scan for heat signatures at the border,
but there are blind spots that I can guide you through via satellite.
There can be no margin of error, so you must follow my every direction.
Any questions?
I thought Fenix was gonna be here.
He'll meet you out there.
All right, everybody sync up.
Good luck, gentlemen.
[ Gisele On Radio ] Satellite link-up engaged.
Keep proceeding northbound at current speed.
Stay close to Fenix.
He'll lead you across.
I've got a heat signature northbound along Legardo Ravine.
Thermal imaging window on the Mexico side's gonna be down for about 45 seconds.
Get the camera on it.
Manual override. Rerouting camera to designated coordinates.
[ Gisele ] Hurry it up. You guys have been tagged.
Oh, shit.
[ Gisele ] Toretto, get back in formation.
Reimaging commencing.
I don't see anything. They're gone.
Get the helicopters to cover it.
[ Pilot ] Uh, Base, we're 40 seconds out from Legardo Ravine.
[ Gisele ] They're sending a helicopter.
[ Gisele ] You have 30 seconds.
[ Pilot ] North 32-33, west 116-49.
[ Gisele ] The window's closing fast.
You need to get out of there before they send ground support.
[ Gisele ] Fifteen seconds.
[ Pilot ] Base, target is at two miles.
[ Gisele ] You're running out of time.
[ Gisele ] You need to get out now!
Uh, Base, we're at, uh, north 32-33, west 116-49.
We have no visual contact. Roll ground units for confirmation.
Sloppy!
Very sloppy!

Come on. i'Pa'fuera! i'Salte!

[ Man ] Hey, Malik, chill, bro.
Yo, man, what's up with your boy?
Hey, boss man!
What did you say?
I said only pussies run nitro-meth.
You looked under my hood?
I'm talkin' to you. You got somethin' on your mind?
You got somethin' on your mind?
'70 Plymouth.
Her name was Letty.
Where's my money?
[ Dom ] And somebody wrecked her car.
I wrecked her car.
You remember her face?
'Cause I don't.
Last time I saw it, it was burning.
Now what?
I'm gonna enjoy what happens next.
Dom, get in!
Get in! Come on!
[ Sirens Wailing ] Come on! Get in the fuckin' car! Let's go! Hurry up!
[ Penning ] What have you got, Trinh?
We're contacting agencies in multiple countries.
Unfortunately, most of them have to manually scan their prints for us to upload.
O'Conner's on line five. And, sir, you should see this.
Thank you.
[ Beeps ] Talk to me, O'Conner.
Where the hell have you been? I got the shipment.
"I" got the shipment, or we got the shipment?
[ O'Conner On Speaker ] What are you talkin' about?
Traffic cams in the area picked up pictures of you and Toretto together.
Listen to me, O'Conner. Bring in the shipment and bring in Toretto.
But I thought the point was to get Braga. We got an opportunity here.
Brian, the clock's stopped ticking.
Bring them in. Are we clear?
O'Conner? [ Phone Beeps ]
So this is what $60 million looks like.
We gotta get you to a doctor.
We gotta find a place to hide this.
I got a spot.
502, Wet Reckless. I need a 48-hour hold.
Out back. Any spot you can find.
You sure about this?
Yeah. The last place they'll check: their own impound yard.
The last place they'll check: their own impound yard. Trust me.
I've been thinkin'. When you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine too.
Yeah? Yeah.
So now you owe me a 10-second car.
Is that right? Yeah.
Now we're even.
This your way of keeping me away from him?
You're the only one I could call. He's my brother. Of course.
Well, the bullet's not in there.
Gonna clean it and stitch it up.
It's gonna hurt. I bet you're gonna enjoy this.
A little.
Want some of this? Yeah.
It's spicy. Be careful.
- You like it hot. - Mmm.
Dom, what are you doing? You reached first. You have to say grace.
Thank you, Lord, for blessing this table.
With food... and family... and friendship.
You asked me why I let Dom go.
I think it's because at that moment...
I respected him more than I did myself.
One thing I learned from Dom is that...
nothin' really matters unless you have a code.
And what's your code, Brian?
I'm workin' on it.
- Oh, shit. Hey, Dom-- - When were you gonna tell me?
- Dom, what are you doing? - When were you gonna tell me you were runnin' Letty?
- Let me explain. - When were you gonna--
- Dom, stop! Stop! - You don't understand.
- Dom, stop! Stop! - You don't understand. - I don't understand? - Stop!
- I don't understand? - Stop!
Shit!
Dom! Dom!
Dom, stop it! Please stop!
She did it for you, Dom! She did it for you.
Letty came to me to clear your name in exchange for bringing down Braga.
She just wanted you to come home!
[ Yells ] I'm sorry, Dom! I'm sorry!
[ Sighs ] You better have one hell of an explanation. You disobeyed a direct order.
Where's the shipment? It's safe.
"It's safe."
"It's safe." Look, we could use the shipment to parade in front of the media,
get a few hundred pounds of heroin off the street,
but Braga's just gonna send another shipment next week and the week after that.
Let's use the shipment to lure Braga out and lop the head off a multi-billion dollar cartel.
And how do you suggest we do that?
A hand-to-hand exchange with Braga.
- No, he'll never show. - He can't afford not to.
You got a plan?
There's a price.
We bag Braga, you let Toretto walk.
[ Beeps ] Yes? It's Dom.
I was just thinking about you.
You know, when I gave you my number I was hoping you'd call.
But not under these circumstances.
What circumstances? Me being alive?
Don't take it personally.
It's just business.
I got some business of my own.
Get Campos.
It's them.
Was that how Braga inspires loyalty? Killing his drivers?
One can always find more drivers.
It's just good business.
- I want to trade. - Braga doesn't negotiate.
[ Dom Chuckles ] Fine.
[ Dom Chuckles ] Fine. Then you explain to him how all of a sudden $60 million worth of product disappears.
I know that can't be good for business.
What do you want?
Six million cash, delivered by Braga himself.
[ Dom ] I don't like being shot at.
I ain't gonna put my neck out again unless he's got somethin' to lose too.
- He'll never go for it. - Either I deal with Braga, or you do.
When and where?
Sir, players are on site. Holding positions at the perimeter.
All right, listen up. Everybody stay frosty.
We don't move a muscle until O'Conner gives the signal.
When he gets the money, you know what to do.
Well, the good news is, when we get this guy, you walk outta here a free man.
Is that what they told you?
Yeah, that's the deal.
You still put milk and cookies out for Santa Claus? [ Chuckles ] Yeah.
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.
Here. In case things go shitty.
Just like old times? Yeah.
Oye. You dropped something.
That's what you wanted, right? Toma! No, no, hey, Dom. Cálmate.
He's harmless. Don't worry about him.
And he's really sorry about Letty.
Where's our stuff?
You mean the stuff that used to be in here, right?
Well, you'll see it when we see Braga. That was the deal.
No worries.
Braga keeps his word.
Two million.
You get the rest when I get my property.
Stasiak. [ Trinh ] We got a match.
Fingerprint's Braga's a hundred percent.

Wouldn't be the first bad guy you helped escape the law's grasp.

That's no longer your concern.
We now know where Braga is, right?
Customs tracked him via satellite to his home base in Tecale, Mexico.
Mexico is out of our jurisdiction.
The fact is, the brass'll be so busy holding press conferences over the seizure,

So, for my family genealogy report,
I decided to do it on my great-great-grandfather,

In fact, he was one of the first to explore the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.

So that's the story, right?
And here we have some of the basic instruments and tools
used by 19th-century seamen.

This here is the quadrant, which you can get for 80 bucks.
It's all for sale, by the way.
(STUDENTS CHUCKLING) Like the sextant here. $50 for this, which is a bargain.
These are pretty cool. These are my grandfather's glasses.
I haven't quite gotten them appraised yet, but they've seen many cool things.
HOSNEY: Are you going to sell me his liver?
Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell. It's the 11th grade.
I don't think your grandfather would be
particularly proud of what you're doing.
I know. I'm sorry. I just, you know, this is all going towards my car fund.

Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense.
I am so underdressed.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Secretary of Defense.
Please be seated.
I'm John Keller.
Obviously, you're wondering why you're here,
so these are the facts.
At 1900 local time yesterday,
the SOCCENT Forward Operations Base in Qatar was attacked.
So far as we know, there were no survivors.
The objective of the attack was to hack our military network.
We're not sure exactly what they're after,
but we do know that they were cut off during the assault,
which would lead us to assume that they're going to try it again.
Now, no one's taken responsibility for the attack.
And the only real lead we have so far is this sound.
That's the signal that hacked our network.
NSA's working at full capacity to analyze it
and intercept further communications,
but we need your help to find out who did this.
Now, you've all shown considerable ability
in the area of signals analysis.
We're on a hair-trigger here, people.
The President has dispatched battle groups
to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea.
This is as real as it's ever gonna get.
Now I'm gonna leave you to your officer-in-charge.
You'll break up into teams and you'll start your work.
Good luck to us all.
All right, Mojo. I got the car. Now I need the girl.
I need money to take out the girl is what I need.
Zero bids.
(SIGHS) Great. Broke.
(SNARLING) Come on, Mojo. You want your pain pills?
No. Premature.
Good. What's up?
Nothing. You know, just driving my car. Driving my car.
It's like clockwork.
All right, I know you get wasted on these things,
but if you piss in my bed again, you're sleeping outside. Okay?
That's it for today. No more. Crackhead.
Ron, this one is uneven. Yeah. Probably.
This one is wobbly.
Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon.
(LAUGHS) Couldn't we have hired a professional?
Sam... What?
I do not like footprints on my grass.
What foot... There's no footprints. That's why I built my path.
So why don't you go from my grass onto my path, okay?
It's family grass, Dad. Well, when you own your own grass,
you'll understand. This... I can't do it anymore.
What? You're putting girl jewelry on a boy dog.
He's got enough self-esteem issues as a Chihuahua, Mom.
JUDY: That's his bling.
I want you home at 11:00!
Yeah, all right. 11:00!
JUDY: Please, for the love of God, drive safely.
Seat belt on!
Wow. You are so cheap.
Well, it's his first car. Supposed to be like that.

♪ I was wrong ♪ And I just can't live without you ♪
There it is.
I had fun. So, you know, thanks for listening.
Oh, yeah, yeah. You... You think I'm shallow?
I think you're... No, no, no. I think...
I think there's a lot more than meets the eye with you.
(CHUCKLES) Okay.
Yeah. All right, I'll see you at school.
All right.
That's stupid.
That was a stupid line.
"There's more than meets the eye with you." Stupid.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God. I love my car.
Hey, guys, I think the other team figured it out. Iran.
Come on, man. This is way too smart for Iranian scientists.
Think about it.
What do you think, kid? Chinese?
No way. This is nothing like what the Chinese are using.
PILOT: This is Air Force One. Level of flight, level three-three-zero.
KELLER ON TV: We will hunt down this enemy. And when we do,
we'll know just what to do with them.
Thank you. You're welcome.
REPORTER ON TV: Apparently, there are very few survivors.
Yes, Mr. President? Yeah, can you wrangle me up some Ding Dongs, darling?
I joined the Air Force to bring the man Ding Dongs.
I'll be in storage.
Shoot.
Ugh. Gross.
Do you hear that?
Are you getting this?
I think they're hacking the network again.
Oh, my God. This is a direct match to the signal in Qatar.
Are you running a diagnostic? Should I be?
Are you running a diagnostic? Should I be? Yes, you should. So I am.
Yes, you should. So I am.
(BEEPING)
Someone! They're hacking into Air Force One!
We need a senior analyst.
I think they're planting a virus. A virus?
It's streaming right now. They are planting a virus
and stealing a whole lot of data from your system at the same time.
Code Red. We have a breach.
MAN: Air Force One, someone onboard has breached the military network.
I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear.
You got to cut the hard lines. What?
Whatever they want, they are getting it.
Sir?
Permission to take down the Defense Network.
Cut all server hard lines now.
Cut all server hard lines now.
(BEEPING)
Someone's tampered with the POTUS mainframe.
What the...
MAN ON RADIO: Shots fired in the underdeck. Repeat, shots fired.
CAPTAIN: Crew, prepare for emergency descent.
I want our President in that bunker.
And I don't want to discuss a damn thing other till that becomes reality.
That's our first priority. That's our only priority right now.
Air Force One is on the ground.
(SPEAKING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE)
Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
That's my car!
No!
No, no, no, no.
Dad, call the cops!
Where you going with my car, buddy? Where you going?
Hello? 911 emergency! My car has been stolen!
I'm in pursuit! Right? I need all units, the whole squadron.
Bring everyone! No, don't ask me questions, all right?
My father's the head of the neighborhood watch!
Oh, my God.
My name is Sam Witwicky.
Whoever finds this, my car is alive, okay? You saw that?
Since this is my last words on Earth, I just wanna say, Mom, Dad, I love you,
and if you find  Busty Beauties under my bed, it wasn't mine.
I'm holding it for Miles. No, no, wait that...
Okay, that's not true. It's mine and Uncle Charles gave it to me.
I'm sorry. Mojo, I love you.
No! No! No! No!
Oh, my God.
No, you're a good dog! Good dog! Good dog!
No, you're a good dog! Good dog! Good dog! Oh, my God.
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! All right! Oh! No! No!
Okay. Please, please don't kill me!
I'm sorry! Take the keys! I don't want them! Car's yours!
Listen, listen, listen.
Good, you're here. Let me see your hands!
No, no, no! It's not me! Let me see your hands.
The guy's inside. Shut up! Walk towards the car.
Shut up! Walk towards the car.
Put your head on the hood.
Whoever did this finally managed to infiltrate our defense network,
which is what they tried to do in Qatar, only this time it worked.
What did they get? We still don't know.
Talk to me about the virus. It's a Spider-bot virus.
We're not sure what it's going to do, but it may cripple the system.
KELLER: Can we stop it? Every time we try an antivirus,
it adapts and speeds up. It's like it's not a virus anymore.
it adapts and speeds up. It's like it's not a virus anymore. It's become the system.
BRIGHAM: Obviously the first phase of a major attack against the US.
The only countries with this kind of capability are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.
are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.
I'm sorry, that's not correct.
Excuse me, young lady.
I didn't see you standing there. You would be who?
I'm just the analyst who detected the hack.
Hold on. It was you? You did it?
Her team. Sir, I was just trying to say,
Her team. Sir, I was just trying to say, they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.
Okay. Even a supercomputer with a brute force attack
would take 20 years to do that.
Maybe you can explain, then, how our latest satellite imagery
shows North Korea doubling its naval activity.
Maybe it's a precaution, because isn't that what we're doing?
The signal pattern is learning.
It's evolving on its own.
And you need to move past Fourier transfers
and start considering quantum mechanics.
There is nothing on Earth that complex.
What about an organism? A living organism?
Maybe some kind of DNA-based computer?
And I know that that sounds crazy... That's enough. That's enough.
We have six floors of analysts working on this thing.
Now, if you can find proof to back up your theory,
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you.
But if you don't get a filter on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna be off the team. You understand?
on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna be off the team. You understand?
Look, I can't be any clearer than how crystal clear I am being.
It just stood up. It just stood up.
Wow. That's really neat.
Okay, chiefie. Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.

We're linking the call to the nearest AWACS.

Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait! Stop!
I am sorry to bother you.
Maggie? Listen, I need your help.
No! This is my private area, my place of Zen and peace.
Listen to me. GRANDMA: Glen! Who is it?
Shut up, Grandma!
What are you doing here? Just give me a break, will you, please?
(GRANDMA SHOUTING) Grandmama! Drink your prune juice!
(EXCLAIMING) Oh! What level are you on, man? Six.
Oh, here come the matrix! Here come the matrix!

Yeah. Get low. Here we go. Here we go. Double tap.

Hey, I just paused it. I just paused it.
Hey. I need a moment.
Please. MAGGIE: Sorry.
Hey, man, save my game.
How classified?
Like "I will go to jail for the rest of my life for showing you" classified.
Yes! One quick peek.
Special Ops got a thermal snapshot of whatever hit the base in Qatar.
I want to see it. Well, the imager was damaged, sir.
The rangers are en route with the imager,
but we also have a security issue.
Circle logs indicate one of the analysts made a copy
of the network intrusion signal.
The signal strength is through the roof.
Where did you say you got this?
It hacked the national military air-guard frequency
It hacked the national military air-guard frequency in less than a minute.
No way. Yeah.
Looks like there's a message embedded in the signal.
Let me work my magic.
"Project Iceman"?
What's Sector Seven? Who is Captain Witwicky?
(SHUSHING) Are you playing those video games again?
Cops! Cops!
FBI! Clear right!
(SCREAMING) AGENT: Lock it down! Lock it down!
OMAR: Cops!

Wait! I'm just a cousin! I'm just a...

Stop with the barking, Mojo. It's too early. Please?
Miles? Miles, listen to me. Listen.
My car, it stole itself, okay? What are you talking about, man?
Satan's Camaro. In my yard. It's stalking me.
Stop!
No, no, no, no, no, no.
(SHOUTING)
(GROANING) Sam?
Hi.
That was... That was really awesome.
(GROANING) Well, it felt awesome. Are you okay?
I'm not okay, all right? I'm losing my mind a little bit.
I'm getting chased by my car right now. I got to go. You know what? I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.
You know what? I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.
Oh, great. Cops.
Officer!
Listen!
Oh, that hurt.
Listen to me!
Thank God you're here! I've had the worst day ever!
I've been... I've been followed here on my mother's bike! Right?
And my car's right there and it's been following me here!
So get out of the car!

Are you username LadiesMan217?
I don't know what you're talking about! Are you username LadiesMan217?
Yeah. Where is eBay item 21153?
Where are the glasses?
Get back!
Stop!
God!
What is your problem, Sam?
Okay, there's a monster right there! It just attacked me!
Here he comes! All right, get up.
Here he comes! All right, get up. Get up and run! You have to run! Okay.
Sam, what is that thing?
You have to get in the car. Get in. I don't want to. Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me! Sam.
Get in! Go, go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go, go!
Oh, God! We're gonna die! We're gonna die!
No, we're not. No, we're not gonna die.
Oh, my God! Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!
Oh, my God! No!
We're gonna die!
Oh, my God!
We're locked in.
(CAR PASSING) The car won't start. At least we ditched the monster, right?
Okay.
Time to start.
He's got me! Oh, God! (GRUNTING)
He's going to kill me!
No. No, no, no!
Get off!
Kill it! Kill it! Get it, get it, get it, get it!
Not so tough without a head, are you?
Here, come on.
MIKAELA: What is it?
It's a robot.
But like a...
Like a different... You know, like a super-advanced robot.
It's probably Japanese.
Yeah, it's definitely Japanese.
What are you doing?
I don't think it wants to hurt us.
It would have done that already.
Really? Well, do you speak robot?
Because they just had, like, a giant droid death match.
I think it wants something from me. What?
Well, 'cause the other one was talking about my eBay page.
You are the strangest boy I have ever met.
SAM: Can you talk? ANNOUNCER: XM Satellite Radio...
(RADIO CHANNELS SWITCHING) Digital cable brings you...
...Columbia Broadcasting System...
So you... You talk through the radio?
Thank you, you're beautiful. You're wonderful, you're wonderful.
So, what was that last night? What was that?
Message from Starfleet, Captain...
Throughout the inanimate vastness of space...
Angels will rain down like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah!
Visitors from heaven? What... What are you, like, an alien or something?
Any more questions you want to ask?
He wants us to get in the car.
And go where?
Fifty years from now, when you're looking back at your life,
don't you want to be able to say you had the guts to get in the car?
This car's a pretty good driver.
I know.
Why don't you go sit in that seat, there?
I'm not going to sit in that seat. He's driving. Yeah.
You're right.
Well, maybe you should sit in my lap.
Why?
Well, I have the only seat belt here. You know, safety first.
Yeah, all right. Right?
Yeah. Okay.
There, see? That's better.
There, see? That's better. Okay. Okay.
You know, that seat belt thing was a pretty smooth move.
You know, that seat belt thing was a pretty smooth move. (CHUCKLING)
Thank you.
You know what I don't understand?
Why, if he's supposed to be, like, this super-advanced robot,
does he transform back into this piece-of-crap Camaro? (TIRES SCREECHING)
SAM: Whoa! Whoa!
Oh, see? No. Get... No, that doesn't work. See?
MAN: Move it, you moron! Great, now... See?
Fantastic.
Now you pissed him off.
That car is sensitive.
I mean, $4000 just drove off.
What?
This is you...
Oh, my God!
Come on, let's go.
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen! Explosions everywhere!
This is easily a hundred times cooler than  Armageddon. I swear to God!
Fire, fire, fire, fire!
Whoa! Sweet!
Oh, dude, I hope this guy's got asteroid insurance,
'cause he is so boned!
What is that?
There's something in the tree, dude.
No, there's something in the thing by the tree!
Could you guys just give me a space rock?
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?
Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing out here by yourself?
Holy God! What happened to the pool?
Are you Samuel James Witwicky,
descendent of Archibald Witwicky?
They know your name.
Yeah.
My name is Optimus Prime.
We are autonomous robotic organisms from the planet Cybertron.
But you can call us Autobots for short.
Autobots.
What's cracking, little bitches?
OPTIMUS: My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz.
JAZZ: This looks like a cool place to kick it.
What is that? How did he learn to talk like that?
We've learned Earth's languages through the World Wide Web.
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.
You feeling lucky, punk? Easy, Ironhide.
Just kidding. I just wanted to show him my cannons.
(SNIFFING) OPTIMUS: Our medical officer, Ratchet.
The boy's pheromone level suggests he wants to mate with the female.
You already know your guardian, Bumblebee.
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING) Bumblebee, right?
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING) Bumblebee, right? BUMBLEBEE: ♪ Check on the rep Yep, second to none ♪
So you're my guardian, huh?
His vocal processors were damaged in battle. I'm still working on them.
Why are you here?
We are here looking for the All Spark.
And we must find it before Megatron.
Mega-what?
OPTIMUS: Our planet was once a powerful empire, peaceful and just,
until we were betrayed by Megatron,
leader of the Decepticons.
All who defied them were destroyed.
Our war finally consumed the planet,
and the All Spark was lost to the stars.
Megatron followed it to Earth, where Captain Witwicky found him.
My grandfather.
It was an accident that intertwined our fates.
Come back!
I think the dogs have found something.
The ice is cracking! (ALL SHOUTING)
Captain! Grab my rope, Captain!
I'm all right, lads!
Can we throw you a rope, Captain?
Megatron crash-landed before he could retrieve the Cube.
Men! We've made a discovery!
He accidentally activated his navigation system.
OPTIMUS: The coordinates to the Cube's location on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.
How'd you know about his glasses?
eBay. eBay.
If the Decepticons find the All Spark,
they will use its power to transform Earth's machines and build a new army.
And the human race will be extinguished.
Sam Witwicky, you hold the key to Earth's survival.
Please tell me that you have those glasses.
It's like a self-regenerating molecular armor.
Look at the scorch mark where the sabot round hit.
Melted right through.
Melted right through. Hey, aren't sabots hot-loaded for, like, a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?
Hey, aren't sabots hot-loaded for, like, a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?
Close to it. It melts tank armor.
So this metal skin must react to extreme heat.
Heads up! Oh!
I thought you said that thing was dead, man!
Strap it down! Strap it! This thing is wicked.
All right, get on the horn with Northern Command.
Tell them that our effective weapon is high-heat sabot rounds.
Recommend we load them on all the gunships. Go.
You want that piece?
Okay, Maggie, look.
Let me break it down to you how it's gonna happen.
They gonna come through that door and be good cop, bad cop.
Don't fall for that, all right? That's why I ate their food.
See, they put the plate of donuts out here to test your guilt.
If you don't touch it, you're guilty.
I ate the whole plate. The whole plate. Okay?
It's me and you.
They walk through that door, you don't say nothing.
She did it! She did it! She's the one you want! All right?
I was just sitting at home watching cartoons,
playing video games with my cousin, and she came in there.
playing video games with my cousin, and she came in there. And then... Glen, you freak.
Hey! I am not going to jail for you or anybody else!
I have done nothing bad my entire life!
Hey, man, I'm still a virgin. Okay, so what?
Okay, so what?
I've downloaded a couple of thousand songs off the Internet.
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?
I promise! Glen, shut up! No, you shut up! Don't talk to me! Don't talk to me, criminal!
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me! Don't talk to me, criminal!
Oh, sugar rush. This is... This is not his fault.
See? So can I go home now?
Oh, okay. I won't. But just listen to me.
Okay, whoever hacked into your military system downloaded a file, all right?
It was something about someone named Witwicky
and some government group, right? Named Sector Seven.
You have to let me talk to Defense Secretary Keller
before you go to war with the wrong country!
Whatever fell out of the sky ended up right behind...
What did he say? What?
Did he hear it, too? Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah.
What does he think it is? He thinks it's a military experiment.
What a knucklehead. Yeah, well, I think it's a plane.
Still no official word as to what happened. You can see...
Yeah! Call Sam.
Yeah. Why? He should be home in 15 minutes. Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.
Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.
If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late and you'll have to ground him.
Well, I can't ground him if he's not late, can I?
I need you to stay here, all right? You got to stay here and you're gonna watch them.
Okay, okay. All of them.
Do you hear what I'm saying? Yeah, okay, okay. Five minutes, all right?
Thanks for staying on my path. Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey!
The... Oh, the path. I'm sorry. I forgot about the path.
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing right now. How about that?
You know, I buy half your car... Yeah.
...then I bail you out of jail and then I just decided to do all your chores.
The chores. Yeah. Life is great, huh?
Life... Life is fantastic, is how good it is.
It's so... Oh, the trash cans. Sorry, Dad. I'm gonna do the trash cans now.
No, no, I don't want you to strain yourself.
No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad.
I'll do it. It would hurt my feelings if you do it.
You sure? I don't mind, I don't... I promise...
No, no, no, I'm gonna do it.
No, no, no, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do the trash cans and I'm gonna scrape the grill
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna sweep up the whole house right now.
Tonight, right now? Right now.
The... (SHUSHING)
I love you. God, I love you
just so much right now.
You know, Mom wanted me to ground you.
You're three minutes late. Right?
Oh, well, just another thing you did for me, Dad,
because you're such a swell guy.
One more thing, huh?
All right, I love you! Sleep good, handsome man!
What are you doing? What are you doing?
No, watch the path! Watch the path! Watch the... Please, please, please.
Watch the... Please, please, please.
No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!
OPTIMUS: Oops. Sorry. My bad. Oh, I... You couldn't...
You couldn't wait for five... You couldn't wait for five minutes?
I told you to just stay! Just stay! God!
I told you to watch them. I told you. Okay, you know what?
They seem to be in a little bit of a rush. (BARKING) Oh, this is bad. No!
Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!
Oh, wet. No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!
Oh, wet. No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy! Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo. This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.
This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine. He's a pet. Okay? That's all.
He's a pet. Okay? That's all. If you could just put the guns away...
If you could just put the guns away...
Put the... Put them away. Please.
IRONHIDE: You have a rodent infestation.
A what? Shall I terminate?
No, no, no, no. He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua.
This is my... This is my Chihuahua. We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?
He's leaked lubricants all over my foot.
He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo!
He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo! Bad Mojo!
I'm sorry. He's got a male dominance thing.
That's all it is.
My foot's gonna rust. All right.
Okay, okay. (SHUSHING)
Shut up and go hide! Just hurry.
Autobots, recon.
RON: I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen.
Got some ice on his nose.
I had to slap him around a little bit.
You did not.
You didn't even ground him. Almost, almost.
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.
Come on, come on.
SAM: What? What is this? OPTIMUS: Time is short.
They really want those glasses.
Come on. What are you doing? I'm gonna help you. Okay.
Please hurry. SAM: Okay.
Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone. What do you mean?
My glasses were in the bag.
They were in the backpack and now the backpack isn't here.
Well, they're gonna be pissed, so what do you wanna do?
So what I think you should do is you should...
So what I think you should do is you should... You should check this whole... This whole section here.
Just give it a clean sweep, and I'll get the corner here.
Yeah, no, no, no. Not there. That's my... That's my private...
Sorry. That's nothing. You just... You just told me to look... I know,
You just told me to look... I know, but I didn't mean to look inside of my treasure chest.
but I didn't mean to look inside of my treasure chest.
MIKAELA: You should be way more specific so I don't get in trouble in your room.
I'm already stressed out enough.
SAM: Okay. What now?
No. No, no. No, no, no.
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.
Oh, God. Oh!
Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed right here and now it's gone.
My moped's under there, man! Who's gonna pay for that?
Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.
He's back here. I can't deal with this. I can't...
This is my mother's flower... Oops.
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me. If my parents come out here and see you, they're gonna freak out.
My mother's got a temper, okay?
We must have the glasses.
I know you need the glasses. I've been looking everywhere.
They're not here. They're definitely not here.
Keep searching.
I need you to be quiet for five minutes. Ten minutes. Okay?
Ten minutes. Okay?
Please, I'm begging you. You got to... You're making a racket.
I can't concentrate. You want me to look and I'm hearing... Calm down, calm down.
Calm down, calm down. You got to do something here. You got to do something here.
Autobots, fall back. Thank you. Please, for five minutes.
Good? Good? Okay.
Move! Get away!
What's the matter with you? Can't you be quiet? He wants us to be quiet.
Earthquake! Move, move, move, move, move! Earthquake!
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now! How did you get over there so fast?
Wow! That was tingly!
You got to try that! Yeah, that looks fun.
RON: Sam? JUDY: Sammy?
What the hell is that? I don't know.
Sam? That's weird.
Sam! OPTIMUS: Ratchet, point the light.
Come on, hurry. SAM: Listen, we got a major issue in here. What's with the light? You gotta stop the light.
What's with the light? You gotta stop the light.
What's going on? Turn it off. You gotta tell him to shut it off.
What's going on? Turn it off. You gotta tell him to shut it off. Shut it off. RON: Sam, are you in there?
How come the door's locked?
You know the rules. No doors locked in my house!
You know he'll start counting
if you don't open the door! One more chance. Five...
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear. Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal. He's counting!
Sam, just open the door. Three.
Oh, my. Two.
He's counting. Stand back.
What's up? What's with the bat?
RON: Who were you talking to? I'm talking to you.
JUDY: Why are you so sweaty and filthy?
I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager.
We heard voices and noises and we thought maybe you were...
It doesn't matter what we thought. What was that light?
It doesn't matter what we thought. What was that light? No, what light? What? There's no light, Dad! There's no light! You got two lights in your hand! That's what it is.
You got two lights in your hand! That's what it is.
Maybe it bounced... There was light under the door.
Maybe it bounced... There was light under the door. Look, you can't... You can't just bounce into my room like that.
You got to knock. You got to communicate.
We knocked for five minutes. I'm a teenager.
We knocked. You didn't knock.
You were screaming at me, okay? No.
This is repression, what you're doing here.
You're ruining my youth, okay? Oh, for Pete's sakes!
You are so defensive! Were you masturbating?
Judy. Was I...
No, Mom. Zip it, okay?
It's okay. No, I don't masturbate!
That's not something for you to bring up.
That's a father-and-son thing, okay? Father-son thing.
That's a father-and-son thing, okay? Father-son thing. I mean, you don't have to call it that word
if that makes you uncomfortable.
You can call it Sam's happy time or...
Happy time? ...my special alone time...
Stop. Mom. Judy, stop. ...with myself.
Mom, you can't come in and... I'm sorry.
It's just been a weird night. I've had a little bit to drink.
No, no, Dad. Yeah, well, we saw a light.
Oh, parents.
I don't know where it was, but we saw it.
Earthquake! It's another one! Another earthquake! Get in the doorway!
Earthquake! It's another one! Another earthquake! Get in the doorway! JUDY: Okay! Aftershock! Aftershock!
JUDY: Okay! Aftershock! Aftershock!
Oh, I hate these.
Got to ride it out. Ride it out! Quick, hide. JUDY: Hey, the lights are back on. Hide? What?
Where? Come on, get out of that tub.
RON: Can't you take safety seriously?
Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam. Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh.
Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam. Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh. Oh, no! Look at the yard. The yard is destroyed.
Oh, no! Look at the yard. The yard is destroyed.
Judy? Better call the city. We got a blown transformer!
Power pole's sparking all over the place!
Oh, man. Yard's a waste.
Trashed. Gone.
It's a wash. The whole yard. JUDY: You're kidding.
The parents are very irritating. RATCHET: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can I take them out?
Ironhide, you know we don't harm humans. What is with you?
What is with you? Well, I'm just saying we could. It's an option.
We heard you talking to somebody, Sam.
We wanna know who. Mom, I told...
Hi. I'm Mikaela.
I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's.
Gosh, you're gorgeous. Isn't that the prettiest girl?
She can hear you talking, Mom. Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to hear our little family discussion about...
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to hear our little family discussion about... RON: Sorry that we're bugging you. Do you have my backpack?
RON: Sorry that we're bugging you. Do you have my backpack? Come on, hon. Let's go. Oh, it's in the kitchen.
Oh, yes. Okay. Okay.
Yeah. Your mom's so nice.
I want you to distract my parents
while I slip out and get these glasses to them, okay?
Ronald Wickity? It's Witwicky. Who are you?
We're the government. Sector Seven.
Never heard of it. Never will.
Your son's the great-grandson of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?
It's Witwicky.
May I enter the premises, sir?
Ron, there's guys all over the front yard.
What the heck is going on here? Your son filed a stolen car report last night.
We think it's involved in a national security matter.
JUDY: They're ripping up my rose bushes! National security? That's right. National security.
My God, Ron, they're everywhere.
There's guys in suits all around the house! Look at this!
Could you stay off the grass?
Get me a sample and some isotope readings.
They're pulling bushes out of the ground!
Good Lord! They've got to get their hands off my bush!
Drop the bat, ma'am. Hey, hey, hey, that's my...
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.
But you'd better get those guys out of my garden
or I am gonna beat the crap out of them!
Are you experiencing any flu-like symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?
Are you experiencing any flu-like symptoms? Aching joints? Fever? JUDY: No! What is this?
JUDY: No! What is this?
How you doing, son? Is your name Sam?
Yeah. Well, I need you to come with us. Whoa, way out of line.
Sir, I am asking politely. Back off.
You're not taking my son. Really?
You gonna try to get rough with us? No, but I'm gonna call the cops
because there's something fishy going on around here.
Yeah. There's something a little fishy about you, your son,
your little Taco Bell dog and this whole operation you got going on here.
What operation? That is what we are gonna find out.
I think direct contact.
Son? SAM: Yeah.
Step forward, please. Just stand?
Fourteen rads.
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!
If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass!
SIMMONS: Get me a sample on that vegetation ASAP!
RON: Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!
Yeah. Not a word until we get a lawyer!
So,
LadiesMan217.
That is your eBay username, right?
Yeah, but, you know, it was a typo and I ran with it.
What do you make of this? My name is Sam Witwicky, okay? And my...
Is that you?
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.
Last night at the station, you told the officer your car transformed.
Enlighten me. Well, here's what I said, okay?
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding that my car had been stolen...
Really? ...from me, from my home,
but it's fine now because it's back! It came back!
Well, not by itself. Well, no.
Because cars don't do that because that would be crazy.
Because cars don't do that because that would be crazy. (ALL LAUGHING)
That's funny. That is so funny.
So what do you kids know about aliens, huh?
Oh, you mean, like a Martian? Like what,  E.T.?  No.
It's an urban legend. Yeah.
You see this?
You see this? This is an I-can-do- whatever-I-want and- get-away-with-it badge.
This is an I-can-do- whatever-I-want and- get-away-with-it badge.
Right. I'm gonna lock you up forever.
Oh, God. You know what? Don't listen to him.
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to get back to guarding the mall.
You, in the training bra, do not test me.
Especially with your daddy's parole coming up.
What? Parole? It's nothing. Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?
It's nothing. Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?
You know those cars my dad used to teach me to fix?
Well, they... They weren't always his.
You stole cars?
Well, we couldn't always afford a babysitter,
so sometimes he had to take me along.
She's got her own juvie record to prove it!
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot in jail the rest of his natural life.
It is time to talk!
Big! It's big!
Go, go, go, go!
I can't see it! I can't see it!
Shift your weight towards the front! All right! All right!
(ALL SHOUTING)
You A-holes are in trouble now.
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you to my friend,
Optimus Prime.
OPTIMUS: Taking the children was a bad move.
Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.
Freeze!
Whoa! Whoa! Give me those! Whoa!
Hi, there.
You don't seem afraid. Are you not surprised to see us?
Look, there are S-Seven protocols, okay?
I'm not authorized to communicate with you
except to tell you I can't communicate with you.
Get out of the car. All right.
Me? You want me to get... Now! All right, all right. Get out. Hey.
All right, I'm... I'm getting out. I'm getting out. You see?
Very nifty how you put us down without really killing us.
You're good with handcuffs, too, now, huh?
SIMMONS: How you doing?
You weren't supposed to hear all that. How's it going, huh?
Yeah. This is real. Now, listen. If I choose to engage with him, mum is the word, all right?
Now, listen. If I choose to engage with him, mum is the word, all right?
Sam, I have a record because I wouldn't turn my dad in.
When have you had to sacrifice anything in your perfect little life?
Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.
What is Sector Seven? Answer me. I'm the one who asks questions around here. Not you, young man!
I'm the one who asks questions around here. Not you, young man!
How'd you know about the aliens? Where did you take my parents?
I am not at liberty to discuss it. No?
Hey. You touch me, that's a federal offense.
Do-whatever-you-want and- get-away-with-it badge, right?
Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden,
with his big alien friend standing over there.
Where is Sector Seven? Wouldn't you like to know?
Hey!
OPTIMUS: Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.
Get that thing to stop, huh?
All right, tough guy, take it off.
What are you talking about?
Your clothes, all of it, off. For what?
For threatening my dad.
Little lady, this is the beginning of the end of your life.
You're a criminal.
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.
Those are nice. Now get behind the pole.
All right. This is such a felony, what you're doing.
I will hunt you down, okay? He'll hunt you down.
Without any remorse! No remorse.
Enjoy. Okay?
We have got to alert everyone. They already know. Speaker.
They already know. Speaker.
IRONHIDE: Optimus! Incoming!
Roll out.
PILOT 1: Okay, I'm picking up rad readings under that bridge right down there.
Okay, I'm getting really good rad readings. Forty-two and higher.
Up you get.
PILOT 2: Okay, we're dropping in.
Really strong readings right down below us. There he is.
Ship one and two, come on in.
That's it, right there. Mark him, mark him.
Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30. Right off the nose.
I got it. 12:00.
Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.
Got him going down the street.
Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him.
Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?
Okay, I lost him. I lost him.
Okay, we're coming around.
OPTIMUS: Easy, you two.
No! No! No, Sam! Sam, don't drop me!
Sam, don't! Sam, don't! I'm slipping! I'm slipping!
OPTIMUS: Hold on! No!
Sam!
All right, we've got him pinned.
We've got him pinned in the river.
I'm in for the shot.
Stop! Stop!
Wait! No!
Take the shot, get him. Take the shot.
No!
No! Stop!
Stop!
AGENT: Get down on the ground! Get down! Get down!
What? Okay.
Look, he's not fighting back!
COMMANDO 1: Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!
Stop hurting him!
COMMANDO 2: Don't let him move!
I got him here!
No!
Happy to see me again?
Put him in a car with his little criminal friend.
I want that thing frozen and ready for transport!
JAZZ: Hang back. Let me check it out.
Optimus,
are we just gonna stand here and do nothing?
OPTIMUS: There's no way to free Bumblebee without harming the humans.
But it's not right. He... Let them leave.
The Chinese and the Russians are nearing our area of operations
in the western Pacific.
We feel like this could get out of hand real fast.
But the next couple of hours may just define his presidency.
US and Chinese task forces approaching 100 nautical miles
US and Chinese task forces approaching 100 nautical miles of cruise missile range.
Tell the strike group commander
that he's not to engage unless fired on first.
Yes, sir! Mr. Secretary?
Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven,
Advanced Research Division.
Never heard of it. I'm a little busy, Tom. I think you can see that.
Sit rep! Talk to me!
Sit rep! Talk to me! The whole room's gone down, sir.
I can see that!
The virus was coded to shut us down.
General? I'll take a seat.
What do you mean, "shut us down"? They used our network to spread out to the whole world.
They used our network to spread out to the whole world.
The blackout's global.
We have no communications, satellite and land lines are dead.
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick up this telephone and call my family?
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick up this telephone and call my family? (DEAD TONE)
Mr. Secretary? I'm here under direct order from the President.
You really need to see what I have in the case.
BANACHEK: You'll have to accept that there are certain things
BANACHEK: You'll have to accept that there are certain things you won't understand right away.
Sector Seven is a special-access division of the government
convened in secret under President Hoover 80 years ago.
You may remember NASA JPL lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.
We told them to report the mission a complete failure.
It wasn't.
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.
This was classified above top secret.
MAN: EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes.
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.
This is the image from Mars.
Here's the image your Special Ops team was able to retrieve
Here's the image your Special Ops team was able to retrieve from the base attack.
We believe they are of the same exoskeletal type,
and obviously not Russian or North Korean.
Are we talking about an invasion?
We intercepted the message from your Special Ops team.
These things can be hurt by our weapons and now they know it.
That's why the virus shut us down,
so we can't coordinate against their next attack,
which I would bet my ridiculous government salary is coming soon.
Get word to our fleet commanders over the National Guard frequency.
It's a shortwave radio channel.
It might be still working.
Tell them to turn their ships around and come home. ASAP!
And inform all commands to prepare for imminent attack.
Captain Lennox, we need you and your team to come with us right now!
Captain Lennox, we need you and your team to come with us right now! Let's go!
She's in here.
What's going on?
You're coming with me.
You're going to be my advisor.
Me, too?
Who's this?
He's my advisor. He comes, too.
So... What'd they get you for?
I bought a car. Turned out to be an alien robot.
Wow.
Who knew?
COMMANDO: Make a hole! Watch your back!
Please, let this work.
Fire it up, Optimus.
The code. The code on these glasses indicates the All Spark is 230 miles from here.
The code on these glasses indicates the All Spark is 230 miles from here.
I sense the Decepticons are getting ready to mobilize.
They must know it's here, as well.
What about Bumblebee? We can't just leave him to die
and become some human experiment!
OPTIMUS: He'll die in vain if we don't accomplish our mission.
Bumblebee is a brave soldier. This is what he would want.
Why are we fighting to save the humans?
They're a primitive and violent race.
Were we so different?
They're a young species. They have much to learn.
But I've seen goodness in them.
Freedom is the right of all sentient beings.
You all know there's only one way to end this war.
We must destroy the Cube.
If all else fails, I will unite it with the spark in my chest.
That's suicide.
The Cube is raw power. It could destroy you both.
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace to this planet.
We cannot let the humans pay for our mistakes.
It's been an honor serving with you all.
Autobots, roll out! We rolling!
EPPS: Team attention! Present arms!
At ease. Captain, Sergeant. Got your intel. Excellent work.
Thank you, sir. What about the gunships?
They're being retrofitted with sabot rounds now.
If they hit us again, we'll be ready for them.
But it won't do us much good
But it won't do us much good if we can't get world communications back up.
Hey, kid.
I think we got off to a bad start, huh?
You must be hungry?
You want a latte? HoHo? Double venti macchiato?
Where's my car?
Son, I need you to listen to me very carefully.
People can die here.
We need to know everything you know.
We need to know it now. Okay.
But first, I'll take my car, my parents.
Maybe you should write that down.
Oh, and her juvie record. That's got to be gone.
Oh, and her juvie record. That's got to be gone. Like, forever.
Come with me. We'll talk about your car.
Thank you.
The man's an extortionist.
SIMMONS: All right, here's the situation.
You've all had direct contact with the NBEs. NBEs?
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials.
Try and keep up with the acronyms.
What you're about to see is totally classified.
Dear God. What is this?
BANACHEK: We think when he made his approach over the north pole,
our gravitational field screwed up his telemetry.
He crashed in the ice, probably a few thousand years ago.
We shipped him here to this facility in 1934.
SIMMONS: We call him NBE One. SAM: Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you on everything you think you know,
SAM: Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you on everything you think you know,
but, I mean, that's Megatron.
He's the leader of the Decepticons.
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.
Your great-great-grandfather
made one of the greatest discoveries
in the history of mankind.
Fact is, you're looking at the source of the modern age,
the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars,
all reverse-engineered by studying him.
NBE One. That's what we call it.
And you didn't think the United States military might need to know
And you didn't think the United States military might need to know that you're keeping a hostile alien robot frozen in the basement?
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot frozen in the basement? Until these events, we had no credible threat to national security.
Until these events, we had no credible threat to national security.
Well, you got one now.
So why Earth? SAM: It's the All Spark.
All Spark? What is that?
Well, yeah, they came here looking for some sort of cube-looking thing.
Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA Megatron,
that's what they call him,
who's pretty much the harbinger of death, wants to use the Cube
to transform human technology to take over the universe.
That's their plan.
And you're sure about that? Yeah.
You guys know where it is, don't you?
Follow me.
SIMMONS: You're about to see our crown jewel.
TOM: Carbon dating puts the Cube here around 10,000 BC.
The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.
They knew it was alien because of the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube
as well as NBE One.
President Hoover had the dam built around it.
Four football fields thick of concrete.
A perfect way to hide its energy from being detected by anyone
A perfect way to hide its energy from being detected by anyone or any alien species on the outside.
or any alien species on the outside.
Wait, back up. You said the dam hides the Cube's energy.
What kind exactly? TOM: Good question.
Please step inside. They have to lock us in.
Oh, wow.
What's that? Freddy Krueger done been up in here or something?
Oh, no, man. Freddy Krueger have four blades, man.
(SNARLS) That's only three. That's Wolverine!
Right? That's Wolverine! That's very funny.
Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone? I got a phone.
Nokias are real nasty.
You've got to respect the Japanese.
They know the way of the samurai.
Nokia's from Finland.
Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange. He's a little strange.
SIMMONS: We're able to take the Cube radiation
and funnel it into that box.
Mean little sucker, huh?
That thing is freaky!
Kind of like the itty-bitty Energizer Bunny from hell, huh?
(EXCLAIMS) He's breaking the box.
COMMANDO: Go! Go! Go!
Move!
Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.
Banachek. What's going on? Well, the NBE One hangar has lost power...
What? ...and the backup generator
is just not gonna cut it. Do you have an arms room?
Megatron! Megatron! Megatron!
Get everyone to the NBE One chamber now!
The lights are out! Move it! Move it!
Let's go!
They're popping our generators!
Megatron melting!
MAN ON PA: 16502. We're losing pressure.
Stand by! Set!
We're losing pressure!
The cryogenic system is failing! We're losing NBE One!
Forty millimeter sabot rounds on that table!
SOLDIER: That's good. Get all the ammo you got.
Everything you can carry. Bring it.
You got to take me to my car. You have to take me to my car.
He's gonna know what to do with the Cube.
Your car? It's confiscated. Then unconfiscate it.
We do not know what will happen if we let it near this thing!
You don't know. Maybe you know, but I don't know.
You just wanna sit here and wait and see what happens?
I have people's lives at stake here, young man.
Take him to his car!
Drop it.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Drop your weapon, soldier.
There's an alien war going on and you're gonna shoot me?
You know, we didn't ask to be here.
I'm ordering you under S-Seven executive jurisdiction.
S-Seven don't exist. Right. And we don't take orders from people that don't exist.
I'm gonna count to five. Okay. Well, I'm gonna count to three.
KELLER: Simmons? Yes, sir?
I'd do what he says.
Losing's really not an option for these guys.
All right. Okay.
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the world on the kid's Camaro?
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.
SAM: No, no! Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
No, no, stop, stop, stop! Let him go! Let him go!
Are you okay?
They didn't hurt you, right?
Listen to me. The Cube is here
and the Decepticons are coming.
No, no, don't worry about them. They're okay. Right?
They're not gonna hurt you.
Just back up a little bit. He's friendly. He's fine.
Okay, come on. Put the guns down. They're not gonna hurt you.
Here, come with me. I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.
Okay, here we go. He doing something. He doing something.
Oh, my God.
WOMAN: Message from Starfleet, Captain.
MAN: Let's get to it.
He's right. We stay here, we're screwed with Megatron in the other hangar.
Mission City is 22 miles away.
We're gonna sneak that Cube out of here
and we're gonna hide it somewhere in the city.
Good! Right.
But we cannot make a stand without the Air Force.
This place must have some kind of radio link!
Yes. Shortwave, CB. Right, yes.
Sir, you got to figure out some way to get word out to them. Let's move!
In the alien archive, sir!
The alien... There's an old Army radio console.
Will it work? Anything's possible!
Did you see that...
LENNOX: All right, Sam, get it in the car!
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.
When we get to the city, we're gonna find a radio,
and I'll have Epps vector them in, okay? KELLER: Affirmative!
MAN ON PA: Warning! NBE One cryo-containment failing.
Check that backup system!
MAN: The cryo's failing! You got to bump up the cryo!
MAN: The cryo's failing! You got to bump up the cryo! The cryo's failing!
MAN 2: Come on! Get out of here!
Heads up! Look out!
Set a perimeter around the yellow vehicle!
This way, this way, this way!
Up there! Let's go!
I am Megatron!
SAM: The Cube's okay? Yeah, it's fine. Well, put the seat belt on.
Pour it on him!
STARSCREAM: I live to serve you, Lord Megatron.
Where is the Cube?
The humans have taken it.
You fail me yet again, Starscream. Get them!
Over here, sir!
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.
Come to me, Maxwell, come to me. Plugged in there.
We're hot! We're live! Where are the mikes?
Mikes?
This doesn't work without mikes, Simmons. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
KELLER: Let's find them.
Kid, get in the chair! Just get in the chair, all right?
Okay, I'll sit. I'll sit. They steal everything out of this place.
How do we get the signal out? How do we call the Air Force?
Glen? Huh?
Can you hotwire this computer to transmit a tone through the radio?
What good is that? Morse code! You can use this to transmit it through that!
Okay, I'll do it!
Turn it around. Okay, let's see.
Simmons, I need a screwdriver!
There's Optimus.
GLEN: Almost done.
(CLANGING) What the hell was that?
Barricade the door! (GRUNTING)
KELLER: Get something. Watch out!
Six, five, four, six, three.
Here! Put some rounds in!
Master search.
I got it! We're transmitting!
Send exactly what I say!
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Burn, you little sucker! Burn!
"This is Defense Secretary Keller." Uh-huh.
"Get me NORTHCOM commander."
Whoa! Whoa!
What was that?
Authenticate emergency action. Blackbird 1195...
Sir, I have an authenticated air strike order from Sec Def.
No, no, no, no, no. What?
It's the same cop! Block them, block them, block them.
Oh, my God.
Cool, Mom!
This is so not good.
He's behind the pillar!
GLEN: Shoot that mother... Maggie, cover fire!
GLEN: It's the Air Force! They're responding!
Sucker, burn!
Oh, shit!
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!
PILOT ON RADIO: Raptors, let's scramble, scramble, scramble.
PILOT 2: Strike and Dark Star roll call.
PILOT 3: Looking out the right side.
PILOT 4: Push to Kill Box One Alpha...
Come on, let's go! Mount up!
SOLDIER: Move out! Move out! Go! Go!
Here, I got shortwave radios.
Wait. What am I supposed to do with these?
Well, use them! It's all we got!
EPPS: This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios or something, man.
I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles out of these things.
Are there any aircraft orbiting the city?
F-22 at 12:00.
All right, I want planes for air cover and get Black Hawks on station
to extract that Cube. You got it?
Air Force has arrived! Pop smoke!
Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?
EPPS: We have you visual.
Green smoke is the mark.
Provide air cover and vector Black Hawks for extraction.
It's Starscream!
Please tell me you copy.
Back up! Take cover! Bumblebee!
No, no, no, no, no! Move!
Back up! Back up! LENNOX: Retreat! Fall back!
IRONHIDE: Incoming!
LENNOX: Anybody hurt? Everyone okay?
SOLDIER: Clear the area!
(BUMBLEBEE GROANING) SAM: Oh, my God.
Bumblebee? No. Your legs!
Your legs.
Here. Here, back, back, back, back! You all right?
Please get up. Bumblebee? Get up!
Ratchet!
What the hell was that? What are you talking about?
What do you mean, what am I talking about? They shot at us!
What do you mean, what am I talking about? They shot at us! F-22 pilots would never fly below buildings.
That's alien. That ain't friendly!
You got to get up. You're okay. You're okay.
Come on!
PILOT: Army Black Hawk inbound to your location. Over.
Alpha 273 degrees, 10 miles.
November Victor, 1.2 clicks north. (TANK FIRING)
Move out! Let's go!
SOLDIER: Let's go! Move!
I'm not gonna leave you.
Come on, Decepticon punk!
Oh, my God!
Concentrate your fire!
Come on. Come on.
Megatron!
OPTIMUS: It's Megatron! Retreat! Move! Fall back!
Fall back!
Get our guys out of the way! Get out of here! Go!
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!
EPPS: We need air cover down here now!
Sam, help me with this.
JAZZ: That all you got, Megatron? Come here, little cretin.
You want a piece of me? You want a piece?
No! I want two!
LENNOX: What's going on?
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.
Oh, these things just don't die.
Oh, we're so dead.
Wrap it around the head. Sam!
Where's the Cube? Right there. Okay.
SAM: And take that and wrap it around
the base and then put it around his neck.
Okay? Epps, get those Black Hawks here!
That building.
Okay. What?
All right, I can't leave my guys back there, so here, take this flare.
Okay, there's a tall, white building with statues on top.
Go to the roof. Set the flare. No.
Go to the roof. Set the flare. No. Signal the chopper and set the flare. No, no. I can't do this!
Signal the chopper and set the flare. No, no. I can't do this! Listen to me! You're a soldier now!
All right? I need you to take this Cube.
Get it into military hands while we hold them off,
or a lot of people are gonna die.
You got to go. You got to go. No, I'm not leaving.
You need to go. Go. No, I'm not leaving
till I get Bumblebee out of here, okay?
Army Black Hawk requested.
Immediate evac for civilian boy with precious cargo.
Immediate evac for civilian boy with precious cargo. Headed to rooftop marked by flare.
Sam, we will protect you. Okay.
LENNOX: Epps, where are those planes?
Sam!
No matter what happens,
I'm really glad I got in that car with you.
Sam! Get to the building! Move!
MEGATRON: Decepticons, attack! Hit it!
RATCHET: Cover fire! SOLDIER: Move to cover!
Watch out!
LENNOX: Girl, get that tow truck out of here!
I'm going! I'm going!
Get out of here now!
Megatron!
Prime.
Humans don't deserve to live.
They deserve to choose for themselves.
Then you will die with them!
Join them in extinction!
Keep moving, Sam!
Don't stop!
Sam, get to the building!
Give me that Cube, boy!
Did that jerk just dent my car?
You're not gonna get me. You're not gonna get me!
(EXCLAIMS IN ALIEN LANGUAGE) MEGATRON: I smell you, boy!
Maggot!
Oh, no!
I'll drive! You shoot!
This isn't going well!
Shoot! Shoot!
Nice shot.
SOLDIER: That tank is definitely dead now.
LENNOX: All right, let's go! We got business!
Hey! I'm over here!
We've got the boy.
Watch out!
Missile!
Hang on, Sam!
No! No!
Is it fear or courage that compels you, fleshling?
Give me the All Spark and you may live to be my pet.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm never giving you this All Spark!
Oh, so unwise.
I got you, boy.
Hold on to the Cube!
Disgusting.
Sam?
You risked your life to protect the Cube.
No sacrifice,
no victory. If I cannot defeat Megatron,
you must push the Cube into my chest.
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.
Get behind me.
It's you and me, Megatron.
No, it's just me, Prime.
OPTIMUS: At the end of this day, one shall stand, one shall fall.
You still fight for the weak! That is why you lose!
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys. Targets will be marked.
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys. Targets will be marked. Hey.
Bring the rain. All right?
Bring the rain. All right? All right, let's kill these things.
Move, move, move! Remember, aim low.
Move, move, move! Remember, aim low. Armor's weak under the chest.
EPPS: Target marked. Still waiting.
PILOT: Time on target, 20 seconds.
F-22s, we're still waiting.
Move out!
Incoming!
PILOT: Weapons armed. Status green.
Run! Move!
Second wave's on approach.
What is that? Break off!
Copy. It's either a massive amount of...
Two, get a lock! Pop that guy!
Stay on him. Keep him in your sights.
Take him out!
Two's down!
I'll kill you!
Mine! All Spark!
Sam! Put the Cube in my chest! Now!
Sam!
No, Sam!
Hold up.
OPTIMUS: You left me no choice, brother.
Sam, I owe you my life.
We are in your debt.
Prime, we couldn't save him.
Aw, Jazz.
We lost a great comrade
but gained new ones.
Thank you, all of you.
You honor us with your bravery.
Permission to speak, sir?
Permission granted, old friend.
You speak now?
I wish to stay with the boy.
If that is his choice.
Yes.
Gentlemen, the President has ordered Sector Seven be terminated
and the remains of the dead aliens disposed of.
The Laurentian Abyss is seven miles below sea level,
deepest place on our planet.
The massive depth and pressure there,
coupled with subfreezing temperatures,
would crush and entomb them,
leaving no evidence.
OPTIMUS: With the All Spark gone,
we cannot return life to our planet.
And fate has yielded its reward,
a new world to call home.
We live among its people now, hiding in plain sight,
but watching over them in secret,
waiting, protecting.
I have witnessed their capacity for courage.
And though we are worlds apart,
like us, there's more to them than meets the eye.
I am Optimus Prime
and I send this message to any surviving Autobots
taking refuge among the stars.
We are here.
We are waiting.
Can you shed any light on the recent, so-called alien activity in the area?
Do you know what? I think that
Do you know what? I think that if there was some sort of an alien
infestation... Yeah.
They, the government, would be the first to let you know.
They, the government, would be the first to let you know. The government would let us know.
I mean, this is America. Yeah.
You know, that's how we know we live in a free land,
because there's no secrets.
I mean, look at this.
-You got aliens. MASON: Mm.
You got big green guys tearing down buildings.
When I was a kid, I used to draw cowboys and Indians.
Um, actually, it's Native American, but whatever.
Yeah. Tell you what, though.
It ain't bad, is it?
No. Yeah.
Kid's got a future.
Yeah, well...
...we'll see, I guess.
No, hey! Uh-uh!
You can't saw through that stuff.
These alien bastards are tough.
You gotta use the stuff they use.
-See? All right. SCHULTZ: All right.
Oh, hey!
Glad you could join us. Afternoon.
-Yeah. My alarm didn't go off. -Yeah, your alarm.
Look, just go stack that armor plating like I asked you.
This is a huge deal for us.
HOAG: Attention, please!
In accordance with Executive Order 396B...
...all post-battle cleanup operations are now under our jurisdiction.
Thank you for your service. We'll take it from here.
Who the hell are you?
Qualified personnel.
Look, I have a city contract to salvage all this, okay, with the city, so--
I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage operations are now under our jurisdiction.
Please turn over any and all exotic materials that you've collected...
...or you will be prosecuted.
Ma'am, what am--?
Please. Come here. Hey, lady, come on.
Look...
[WHISPERING] ...I bought trucks for this job.
I brought in a whole new crew.
These guys have a family. I have a family.
I'm all in on this. I could lose my house.
I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.
Maybe next time, don't overextend yourself.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] What'd you say?
Yeah.
He's right. I overextended myself.
MAN 1: Unh! MAN 2: Hey, hey, hey. MAN 3: Don't do it. -Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
HOAG: Put them down.
If you have a grievance, you may take it up with my superiors.
Your superiors. Who the hell are they?
REPORTER: A joint venture between Stark Industries... ...and the government...
...the Department of Damage Control, will oversee the collection...
...and storage of alien and other exotic materials.
Now the assholes who made this mess are paid to clean it up.
Yeah, it's all rigged.
REPORTER: Experts estimate there are over 1500 tons of exotic material...
...scattered throughout the tri-state area.
Hey, chief! We have another load from yesterday.
Hey, chief! We have another load from yesterday. We're supposed to turn this in, right?
I ain't hauling it.
It's too bad.
We could have made some cool stuff from all that alien junk.
I tell you what.
Let's keep it.
The world's changing.
It's time we change, too.
TOOMES: There you go, Mason.
Business is good.
PETER [IN GRAVELLY VOICE]: New York. Queens.
-It's a rough borough, but, hey, it's home. HAPPY: Who you talking to?
PETER [IN NORMAL VOICE]: No one. Just making a little video of the trip.
HAPPY: You know you can't show it to anyone. PETER: Yeah, I know.
HAPPY: Then why are you narrating in that voice?
PETER: Um.... Because it's fun. HAPPY: Fun.
PETER: So, uh, why do they call you Happy?
Come on. I'm not carrying your bags. Let's go.
PETER: Hey, should I go to the bathroom before?
HAPPY: There's a bathroom on it.
PETER: Whoa, no pilot? That's awesome.
PETER: Ahh. -Is that where you're gonna sit? Yeah.
This is your first time on a private plane?
My first time on any plane.
Should it--? Should it be--? Should it be making that noise?
No one has actually told me why I'm in Berlin or what I'm doing.
Something about Captain America going crazy.
-This is you. PETER: Oh, we're neighbors?
We're not roommates. Suit up.
Okay, Peter, you got this.
HAPPY: What the hell are you wearing? -It's my suit.
-Where's the case? -What case?
What? I thought that was a closet.
-This is still my room? -Go.
-My room is way bigger than-- -There.
PETER: I found the case. I found the case.
"A minor upgrade"? Whoa.
Oh, my God.
-Put it on. -What the--?
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen--
-Let's go. -But, yeah. Well, I don't understand.
Is it for me? Happy. Happy, wait.
This is insane. Insane.
Look at this thing. Look. Look at the eyes.
-This is the greatest day of my life. Okay. -Let's go.
PETER [WHISPERING]: Okay, there's Captain America, Iron Man... ...Black Widow. Whoa, who's that new guy?
TONY: Underoos! -Oh, that's me. I gotta go. I gotta go.
PETER [IN NORMAL VOICE]: Hey, everyone.
The craziest thing just happened.
I just had a fight with Captain America. I stole his shield. I threw it at him--
What the hell? He's big now. I gotta go. Hang on.
It was the most amazing thing! Mr. Stark was like, "Hey, Underoos!"
I flipped in and stole Cap's shield. I was like, "What's up, everybody?" And--
Hey, just a second! Coming!
Hey.
We have thin walls here.
What are you doing, a little video diary?
PETER: Yeah. -It's all right.
-I'd do the same thing. HAPPY: I told him not to.
-He was filming. I'm gonna wipe the chip. TONY: Okay.
Hey. You know what?
We should make an alibi video for your aunt anyway. You ready?
PETER: An alibi? Sure. Okay. -We rolling? Get in the frame.
Hey, May. How you doing? What are you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope. Ha-ha-ha.
Peter, that's inappropriate. Let's start over. -You can edit it. -Mm-hm.
-Three, two, one. Hey, May. -Ha-ha-ha.
My gosh, uh, I wanted to tell you what an incredible job your nephew did...
...this weekend at the Stark internship retreat.
Everyone was impressed.
HAPPY: Come on! It's a freaking merge. I'm sorry.
This is because you're not on Queens Boulevard.
See, Happy is hoping to get bumped up to asset management.
He was forehead of security, before that he was a driver.
That was a private conversation.
I don't like joking about this. It was hard to talk about that.
No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch? HAPPY: Here we are. End of the line. Whoops.
TONY: Can you give us a moment? -Want me to leave? TONY: Grab Peter's case out of the trunk.
-Want me to leave? TONY: Grab Peter's case out of the trunk.
I can keep the suit?
Yes, we were just talking about it.
Do me a favor, though. Happy's kind of your point guy on this.
Don't stress him out. Don't do anything stupid. I've seen his cardiogram.
Don't do anything stupid. I've seen his cardiogram.
-All right? -Yes.
Don't do anything I would do, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
There's a little gray area in there. That's where you operate.
-Wait, does that mean I'm an Avenger? -No.
-This it? TONY: Seventh floor.
-I can take that. You don't have to. -You'll take it?
-Yeah, I can take that. -Thank you.
So when's our next, uh--? When's our next "retreat," you know?
-What, next mission? -Yeah, the mission. The missions.
-We'll call you. -Do you have my numbers?
No, I mean, we'll call you.
-Like, someone will call you. All right? -Oh.
-From your team. -Okay. All right.
It's not a hug. I'm just grabbing the door for you. We're not there yet.
Bye.
They're gonna call me.
What's up, Penis Parker?
Rise and shine, Midtown Science and Technology.
Don't forget about your homecoming tickets.
Do you have a date for homecoming?
Thanks, Jason, but I already have a date.
-Okay. -Yeah.
Ahh, damn it. You, in my office right now.
BOY [IMITATING EMPEROR PALPATINE]: Join me, and together...
...we'll build my new LEGO Death Star.
-What? GIRL 1: So lame.
That's awesome. How many pieces?
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Three thousand eight hundred and three.
-That's insane. -I know. You want to build it tonight?
No, I can't tonight. I've got the Stark--
-Mm-hm. Stark internship. -Yeah, exactly.
Always got that internship.
Yeah, well, hopefully, soon it'll lead to a real job with them.
-That would be so sweet. -Right?
He'd be all, "Good job on those spreadsheets, Peter.
Here's a gold coin."
-I don't know how jobs work. -That's exactly how they work. Oh, heh.
I'll knock out the bones of the Death Star.
I'll come by afterwards. For the most part, the difficult thing is the base of it.
The top half we can knock out in two hours, tops.
That'd be great.
GIRL 2: I'm gonna be late.
Okay, so how do we calculate linear acceleration...
...between points A and B?
Flash.
It's the product of sine of the angle and gravity divided by mass.
Nope. Peter. You still with us?
PETER: Uh, uh, yeah, yeah. Uh....
Mass cancels out, so it's just gravity times sine.
Right. See, Flash, being the fastest isn't always the best if you are wrong.
[WHISPERING] You're dead.
MR. COBWELL: Today we're talking about Danish physicist Niels Bohr...
...but trust me, there's nothing Bohr-ing...
...about his discoveries regarding quantum theory.
Did Liz get a new top?
NED: No. We've seen that before, but never with that skirt.
GIRL 1: Liz, hey. That looks so good. -Hi!
We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy.
MICHELLE: Too late.
You guys are losers.
Well, then why do you sit with us?
Because I don't have any friends.
Next question.
What is the heaviest naturally-occurring element?
Hydrogen's the lightest.
That's not the question. Okay.
CHARLES: Yeah. -Uranium.
Correct. Thank you, Abraham.
-Yes. -Please open your books to page 10.
Peter, it's nationals.
Is there no way you could take one weekend off?
I can't go to Washington. If Mr. Stark needs me, I have to make sure I'm here.
You've never been in the same room as Tony Stark.
Wait. What's happening?
-Peter's not going to Washington. CINDY: No.
-No, no, no. -Why not?
Really? Right before nationals?
He already quit marching band and robotics lab.
I'm not obsessed with him. Just very observant.
Flash, you're in for Peter.
FLASH: I don't know. I gotta check my calendar first.
I got a hot date with Black Widow coming up.
That is false.
What'd I tell you about using the bell for comedic purposes?
PETER: Hey, what's up? -Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Delmar?
Hey, Mr. Parker.
Number five, right?
Yeah, um, and with pickles, and can you smush it down real flat? Thanks.

Here's 5 dollars.

How you doing, buddy?

Ah, it's boring. Got better things to do.
Stay in school, kid. Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me.

HAPPY: Happy Hogan.
PETER: Hey, Happy. Here's my report for tonight.
I stopped a grand theft bicycle.
Couldn't find the owner, so I just left a note, um....
I helped this lost, old Dominican lady.
She was really nice and bought me a churro.
I just, um, feel like I could be doing more.
You know? Just curious when the next real mission's gonna be.
So, yeah, just call me back.
It's Peter. Parker.
Why would I tell him about the churro?
Hey, hey. Aah.
Okay.
MAN 1: Can't wait to see this thing. PETER: Finally, something good.
MAN 1: Yo, this high-tech stuff makes it too easy.
-Told you it was worth it. MAN 2: Okay, go, go, go.
MAN 3: Oh, nice.
We can hit, like, five more places tonight.
What's up, guys? You forget your PIN number?
Whoa, you're the Avengers.
What are you guys doing here?
Thor. Hulk. Good to finally meet you guys.
I thought you'd be more handsome in person. Iron Man.
Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank? You're a billionaire.
Hey--
[VOICE FUZZING] Oh, this feels so weird.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] What is that thing?

DISPATCHER [ON PHONE]: 911. What's your emergency?
Uh, Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers in a bank on 21st Street.
PETER: Let's wrap this up. It's a school night.
PETER: So how do jerks like you get tech like this?
PETER: No. Wait, wait, wait!
Mr. Delmar.
Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in here? Is anybody in here? Hello?
Oh, come on.
PETER: I gotta--
-Here, here. -Good, yeah.
Okay. Good. Yes.
Yes-- No. No, put that down.
That's worth more than you or me.
-Yeah? -The craziest thing just happened. These guys were robbing an ATM...
-...with high-tech weapons-- -Take a breath. I don't have time...
-...for ATM robberies... -Yeah, but--
...or the notes you leave. I have moving day to worry about.
Everything's gotta be out next week.
-Wait. You're moving? Who's moving? -Yeah, don't you watch the news?
Tony sold Avengers Tower. We're relocating to a new facility upstate...
-...where hopefully cell service is worse. -But what about me?
-What about you? -Unh!
Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me or something big goes down?
-Can I please talk to Mr. Stark? -Stay away from anything dangerous.
I'm responsible for making sure you're responsible, okay?
I am responsible. I-- Oh, crap.
-My backpack's gone. -That doesn't sound responsible.
-I'll call you back. -Feel free not to.
MAY: What was that?
Uh, it's nothing. Nothing.
You're the Spider-Man.
-From YouTube. -I'm not. I'm not.
-You were on the ceiling. -No. What are you doing in my room?
May let me in. We were gonna finish the Death Star.
You can't just bust into my room!
Ha-ha. That turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster.
Let's go to dinner. Thai? Ned, you want Thai?
-Yes. -No. He's got a thing.
A thing to do after.
Okay.
Maybe put on some clothes.
-Oh, she doesn't know? -Nobody knows.
Mr. Stark knows because he made my suit. That's it.
[WHISPERING] Tony Stark made you that? Are you an Avenger?
Yeah, basically.
You can't tell anybody about this. You gotta keep it a secret.
-[IN NORMAL VOICE] Secret? Why? -You know what she's like.
If she finds out people try and kill me every night, she won't let me do this.
Come on, Ned, please.
Okay, okay, okay.
I'll level with you. I can't keep this a secret.
It's the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.
Ned, May cannot know. I cannot do that to her right now.
You know? I mean, everything that's happened with her, I-- Please.
-Okay. -Just swear it, okay?
I swear.
-Thank you. -Yeah.
I can't believe this is happening now.
-Can I try the suit on? -No.
How's it work? Magnets? How do you shoot the strings?
-I'm gonna tell you at school tomorrow. -Great.
Okay, well, wait, then.
How do you do this and the Stark internship?
This is the Stark internship.
-Oh. -Just get out of here.
MAY: What's the matter?
Thought you loved larb.
It's too larby?
Not larby enough.
How many times do I have to say "larb" before you talk to me?
You know I larb you.
I'm just stressed. The internship, and I'm tired.
A lot of work.
The Stark internship.
I have to tell you, not a fan of that Tony Stark.
You're distracted all the time. He's got you in your head.
NEWS ANCHOR [ON TV]: Delmar's Sandwiches was destroyed... What does he have you doing?
-...in an explosion... -You need to use your instincts.
...after an ATM robbery was thwarted by Queens' own crime stopper...
What?
...the Spider-Man.
As the Spider-Man attempted to foil their heist...
...a powerful blast was set off, slicing through the bodega across the street.
Miraculously, no one was harmed.
If you spot something like that happening, you turn and you run the other way.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
Six blocks away from us.
I, uh, need a new backpack.
-What? -I need a new backpack.
MAY: That's five.
-Sticky rice pudding. -We didn't order that.
It's on the house.
Oh, thanks.
That's nice of him.

Can it bite me?
Well, it probably would've hurt, right?
Whatever. Even if it did hurt, I'd let it bite me.
Maybe. How much did it hurt?
The spider's dead, Ned.
NED: You were here?
PETER: Yeah.
You could've died.
-Do you lay eggs? -What?
-Do you lay eggs? -What? No. Ha-ha.
-Can you spit venom? -No.
Can you summon an army of spiders?
No, Ned.
The Sokovia Accords were put into place....
[WHISPERING] How far can you shoot your webs?
[WHISPERING] It's unknown. Shut up.
--to begin regulating....
If I was you, I would stand on a building...
-...and just shoot it as far as I could-- -Shut up, Ned.
Hi. I'm Captain America. Whether you're in the classroom or on the battlefield...
-Do you know him too? -Yeah, we met.
...fitness can be the difference between success or failure.
-I stole his shield. -What?
Today, my good friend, your gym teacher...
...will conduct the Captain America Fitness Challenge.
Thank you, Captain.
Pretty sure he's a war criminal, but I have to show these videos.
It's required by the state. Let's do it.
NED: Do Avengers have to pay taxes? PETER: Shh!
NED: What does Hulk smell like? PETER: Shh!
NED: I bet he smells nice. PETER: You have to shut up.
Is Captain America cool, or is he like a mean, old grandpa?
Ned, just, shh, okay?
-Hey, can I be your guy in the chair? -What?
Yeah. You know how there's a guy with a headset...
...telling the other guy where to go?
If you're in a burning building, I could tell you where to go.
There'd be screens around me, and I could swivel around.
-I could be your guy in the chair. -I don't need a guy in the chair.
Looking good, Parker.
Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor...
...marry Iron Man and kill Hulk.
Well, what about the Spider-Man?
LIZ: It's just "Spider-Man."
Did you see the bank security cam on YouTube? He fought off four guys.
Oh, my God, she's crushing on Spider-Man.
No way.
-Kind of. -Oh, gross.
-He's probably 30. -You don't know what he looks like.
Like, what if he's seriously burned?
I wouldn't care. I'd love him for the person he is inside.
Peter knows Spider-Man.
No, I don't. No. I-- I mean--
They're friends.
Yeah, like Coach Wilson and Captain America are friends. Heh.
I've met him, yeah. A couple times.
But it's, um...
...through the Stark internship. Mm-hm.
Yeah, well, I'm not really supposed to talk about it.
Well, that's awesome. Hey, you know what?
Maybe you should invite him to Liz's party. Right?
Yeah, I'm having people over tonight. You're more than welcome to come.
-Having a party? FLASH: Yeah, it's gonna be dope.
You should totally invite your personal friend Spider-Man. -Um.... -It's okay.
-Um.... -It's okay.
I know Peter's way too busy for parties anyway, so....
Come on. He'll be there. Right, Parker?
What are you doing?
Helping you out.
Did you not hear her?
Liz has a crush on you.
Dude, you're an Avenger.
If any one of us has a chance with a senior girl, it's you.
MAY: House party in the suburbs.
Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous.
-It'll be a night to remember. -Oh, ha-ha-ha.
Ned, some hats wear men. You wear that hat.
-Yeah, it gives me confidence. -Heh.
This is a mistake.
Hey, let's just go home.
Oh, Peter.
I know. I know it's really hard...
...trying to fit in with all the changes your body's going through.
It's flowering now.
He's so stressed out lately.
What helps with stress is a party.
-We should go to the party. -Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna go.
Peter.
-Have fun, okay? Okay. -I will.
Bye, May.
GIRL: Come dance with me! Dude, you have the suit, right?
-Yeah. -This is gonna change our lives.
GIRL 1: Annie, over here! -Hey.
Hey.
MAN'S VOICE [OVER SPEAKERS]: DJ Flash.
Okay. We're gonna have Spider-Man swing in...
...say you guys are tight, and I get a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.
Can't believe you're at this lame party.
But you're here too.
Am I?
Oh, my gosh. Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned.
-Hi, Liz. -Hi, Liz.
I'm so happy you guys came.
There's pizza and drinks. Help yourself.
-What a great party. -Thanks.
Oh, I--
My parents will kill me if anything's broken. I gotta--
-Yeah. -Have fun.
-Bye. LIZ: Bye.
Dude, what are you doing?
She's here. Spider it up.
No, no, no. I can't-- I cannot do this.
Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay?
Look, I'm just gonna be myself.
Peter, no one wants that.
Dude.
Penis Parker, what's up?
So where's your pal Spider-Man?
Let me guess: In Canada with your imaginary girlfriend?
That's not Spider-Man. That's just Ned in a red shirt.
"Hey, what's up? I'm Spider-Man.
Just thought I'd swing by and say hello to my buddy Peter.
Oh, what's up, Ned? Hey, where's Peter, anyways?
He must be around...."
God, this is stupid. What am I doing?
What the hell?
This sucks.
Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia.
Here. You try.
I wanted something low-key. Why are you trying to upsell me, man?
BRICE: Okay, okay. I got what you need, all right?
I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.
Okay, I got, uh, black-hole grenades, Chitauri railguns....
SCHULTZ: You letting off shots in public now? Hurry up.
Look, times are changing. We're the only ones selling these high-tech weapons.
Oh, this must be where the ATM robbers got their stuff.
I need something to stick up somebody. I'm not trying to shoot them back in time.
I got antigrav climbers.
Yo, climbers?
Okay, what the hell is that?
-Did you set us up? -Hey, hey, man.
Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot at somebody, shoot at me.
All right.
What was that?
-We gotta call him. -No, no, no.
SCHULTZ: Did you just do it again?
-Shut up. -I'm calling him.
Toomes' phone.
MASON: Boss.
Oh, my butt! Unh!
Great. Guess I'm gonna have to take a shortcut.
Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.
Hey, hey, buddy.
Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.
Whoo! Now, this is more like it. Whoa!
Smells really good.
PETER: Great movie!
Ugh.... Oh, hey, guys.
BOTH: Aah! PETER: No! No!
PETER [ON RECORDING]: Hey, it's Peter. Leave a message.
Peter, where are you?
The hat's not working. This is not cool.
Almost got you.
Thought you got away from me, didn't you?
[PANTING] I got you right where I want you.
Surprise!
What the hell?
Oh, hey.
And then he just, like, swooped down like a monster...
...and picked me up, and took me up like a thousand feet and just dropped me.
How'd you find me? Did you put a tracker in my suit?
TONY: I put everything in your suit.
Including this heater.
Whew, that's better. Thanks.
What were you thinking?
The guy with wings is the source of the weapons. I gotta take him down.
Take him down now, huh?
Crockett, there are people who handle this sort of thing.
-The Avengers? -No. This is a little below their pay grade.
Mr. Stark, you didn't have to come out here.
I had that. I was fine.
Oh, I'm not here.
Thank God this place has Wi-Fi...
...or you would be toast right now.
Thank Ganesh while you're at it. Cheers.
Look, forget the flying vulture guy, please.
-Why? -Why?
Because I said so!
Sorry, I'm talking to a teenager.
Stay close to the ground.
Build up your game helping little people, like that lady that bought you the churro.
Can't you just be a friendly...
...neighborhood Spider-Man?
But I'm ready for more than that now.
No, you're not.
That's not what you thought when I took on Captain America.
Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted to lay you out, he would've.
Listen to me. If you come across these weapons again, call Happy.
Are you driving?
You know, it's never too early to start thinking about college.
I got some pull at MIT. End call.
No, I don't need to go to--
FRIDAY: Mr. Stark is no longer connected.
That's awesome.
"Stay close to the ground"? What is he talking about?
Hey, what's up? I'm on my way back.
Actually, I was calling to say maybe you shouldn't come. Listen.
FLASH: When I say "penis," you say "Parker."
-Penis! ALL: Parker!
-Penis! -Parker!
NED: Sorry, Peter. I guess we're still losers.
-I'll see you tomorrow. -I'll see you tomorrow in school.
Idiots.
Idiots.
Idiots!
MASON: Boss?
Your wife keeps texting you. Something about a brake light.
What'd I tell you about looking at my phone?
Oh. Sorry. You left it out.
You know I'm a curious person by nature.
I finished designing that high-altitude vacuum seal.
Huh? In case you want to, you know, go for the big one?
You're still on that? I told you, no.
The answer's no. Forget it.
I mean, that was badass. Ha.
How many times have I told you not to fire them out in the open?
-You said, move the merchandise. -Under the radar.
Under the radar!
That's how we survive.
If you bring Damage Control or the Avengers down here, we're through.
You're out there wearing that goofy thing, lighting up cars...
...calling yourself the Shocker.
"I'm the Shocker. I shock people." What is this, pro wrestling?
Ah, whatever, old man. Come on.
Look.
Look.
I know you don't give a crap about anything.
But I do.
I built this whole place because I got people I have to look after.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what?
I can't afford your bullshit.
-Get out of here. -What?
-You're done. You're off the crew. -Yeah, all right.
All right. Heh.
Wonder if you can afford me out there, though, right?
With everything I know.
-Excuse me? -Uh, I'm just saying...
...maybe your wife would like to know where you really get your money from.
-You know what? -What?
You're right.
-That work? -I don't know.
I can't afford that.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.
Damn.
-I thought this was the antigravity gun. -What?
No, that's that one.
Here.
Now you're the Shocker. Go out there and find that weapon he lost.
All right.
NED: Hey, thanks for bailing on me.
Yeah, well, something came up.
What is that?
I don't know. Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.
-Seriously? -Yeah.
Awesome.
I mean, not awesome. Heh, totally uncool of that guy.
So scary.
Well, look, I think it's...
...a power source.
Yeah, but it's connected to all these microprocessors.
That's an inductive charging plate. That's what I use to charge my toothbrush.
Whoever's making these weapons is combining alien tech with ours.
That is literally the coolest sentence anyone has ever said.
I just want to thank you for letting me be part of your journey...
...into this amazing--
Keep your fingers clear of the blades.
I gotta figure out what this is and who makes it.
NED: We'll go to the lab after class and run tests.
Let's do it.
First, we put the glowy thing in the mass spectrometer.
We gotta come up with a better name than "glowy thingy."
You're right.
Crap.
[WHISPERING] Come on, come on, come on.
High schools creep me out.
They got this funny smell, you know?
Hey, that's one of the guys that tried to kill me.
[WHISPERING] What?
-Yeah. -We gotta get out of here.
No, no, no. I gotta follow them.
They can lead me to the guy that dropped me in the lake.
-Someone dropped you in a lake? -Yeah, it was not good.
-Peter-- -No. Stay there, Ned.
Peter.
What are you doing?
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Nothing. Heh.
-Oh. -Yeah. You good?
Chess.
RANDY: Can you imagine what the boss would say if he knew where we were?
It's saying there was an energy pulse here.
RANDY: There's no sign of the weapon.
-And even if it was here, now it's gone. -So are we.
This is so awesome.
I know, right?
They're in Brooklyn.
Staten Island.
Leaving Jersey.
They stopped.
Maryland?
-What's there? -I don't know.
Evil lair? Heh.
-They have a lair? -A gang with alien guns...
...run by a guy with wings? Yeah.
Badass.
But how are you gonna get there if it's, like, 300 miles away?
It's not too far from D.C.
-Hey, it's Peter. -Guys.
-Peter? -Hey, buddy.
I was hoping I could rejoin the team.
No, no way. You can't quit on us...
...stroll up and be welcomed back by everyone.
Hey, welcome back! Flash, you're back to first alternate.
-What? -He's taking your place.
Excuse me, can we go already?
I was hoping to get in some protesting in front of an embassy before dinner.
Protesting is patriotic. Let's get on the bus.
LIZ: Focus up. Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.
The second law of thermodynamics.
-Frank Sinatra. -Fort Sumter.
-Flash is wrong. -Okay, let's focus. Next one.
Liz, don't overwork them.
Uh, strontium, barium, vibranium.
-Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back. -Glad to be back.
-What is the current standard unit of--? -Can I take this real quick?
Yeah, fine.
-Hello? -Got a blip on my screen here.
You left New York?
LIZ: Okay, focus up, everyone. -Tracker. Uh....
Yeah, it's just a school trip. It's, uh, nothing.
Happy, I gotta say, tracking me without permission...
...is a complete violation of privacy.
-That's different. -What's different?
Nothing. Look, it's just the Academic Decathlon.
-It's no big deal. -Hey, hey. I'll decide if it's no big deal.
Sounds like no big deal, but remember, I'm watching you.
-Everyone stick together. -Yeah.
CHARLES: You kidding me? This place is huge.
FLASH: I've seen bigger. -There's a bird in here.
-Hey, you brought your laptop, right? -Why?
Peter...
...why are we removing the tracker from your suit?
...I gotta follow these guys to their boss before they move again...
...and I don't really want Mr. Stark to know about it.
So you're lying to Iron Man now?
No, I'm not lying.
He just doesn't really get what I can do yet.
Gotcha.
All right, Happy, enjoy tracking this lamp.
There's a ton of other subsystems in here...
-Hmm? -...but they're all disabled... ...by the Training Wheels Protocol.
What?
"Training Wheels Protocol"? Turn it off.
I don't think that's a good idea. They're blocked for a reason.
Come on, man, I don't need training wheels.
I'm sick of him treating me like a kid all the time.
-It's not cool. -But you are a kid.
A kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands.
Peter, I just don't think this is a great idea. I mean, what if this is illegal?
Look, please. This is my chance to prove myself.
I can handle it. Ned, come on.
-I don't think this is a good idea. -The guy in the chair.
-Don't do that. -Come on.
The glowy thing, it's evidence. Keep it safe.
-All right? -Okay. Okay.
-They're moving. -Be careful.
-Hey, Liz. -[WHISPERING] Perfect timing.
We're gonna go swimming.
-Come on, come on, come on. -[WHISPERING] What?
-Hey, Peter. -Hi.
Hey.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] I was, uh-- I was gonna go study in the business center.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] You don't need to. You're the smartest guy I've ever met.
And besides...
...um, a rebellious group activity the day before competition is good for morale.
Um, well, I read that in a TED Talk, so--
I-- I heard it in a TED Talk.
And I read a coaching book.
Wow, you really-- This is really important to you.
Yeah. It's our future.
I'm not gonna screw it up.
Besides, we raided the minibar and these candy bars were, like, $11.
-So get your trunks on and come on. CHARLES: Come on.
SALLY: Come on. LIZ: I'm coming, I'm coming.
CINDY: Let's go.
SPIDER SUIT: Good evening, Peter. -Hello? Hello?
Congratulations on completing the Training Wheels Protocol...
...and gaining access to your suit's full capabilities.
Ah, thank you.
Where would you like to take me tonight?
I put a tracker on someone. He's a bad guy.
Tracker located.
Plotting course to intercept target.
As long as I make it back in time for decathlon, it's fine.
SPIDER SUIT: One hundred meters from destination and closing.
Jump now.
Detecting three individuals.
PETER [WHISPERING]: Why is their secret lair in a gas station? That's so lame.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?
Do you want to hear what they're saying?
I can hear what they're saying? Uh, yeah.
Activating Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.
MASON: I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup. The rest is my design.
Whoa, that's so cool.
RANDY: Can't believe they're still cleaning up... -...that Triskelion mess. SCHULTZ: I love it.
-...that Triskelion mess. SCHULTZ: I love it. They keep making messes, we keep getting rich.
They keep making messes, we keep getting rich. MASON: Target inbound.
[WHISPERING] Whoa, they're in the middle of a heist.
I could catch them red-handed. This is awesome.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Okay, I'll get closer to see what's happening.
Would you like me to engage Enhanced Combat Mode?
Uh, "Enhanced Combat Mode"? Yeah.
Activating Instant Kill.
No, no, no. I don't want to kill anybody.
Deactivating Instant Kill.
Did you hear that?
What the hell just happened? What was that?
You jumped off the sign and landed on your face.
What's wrong with my web-shooters?
Rapid-fire is the default for Enhanced Combat Mode.
-Why would I need rapid-fire? -Would you like to see more options?
You have 576 possible web-shooter combinations.
Whoa, Mr. Stark really overdid it.
You two wait right here.
Wait. You're gonna want to turn on the dampers.
-That thing will shatter your arm. -All right, where's the dampers?
PETER: That one. -Great choice.
Would you like me to set this as your new default?
No, no, no.
-Push that in. No, the other-- -Here? This one here?
-What was that? -Taser webs.
Taser webs? I don't want Taser webs.
You seem to be unfamiliar with your web-shooter settings.
Would you like to run a refresher course?
-No. Just-- You choose. -Sure thing.
WOMAN [OVER RADIO]: Six-alpha-niner, are you running on time?
Copy, central. Six-alpha-niner on schedule.
SCHULTZ: I got a visual. -Green light, green light.
Oh, that's him.
Okay. I got eyes on the convoy.
Pulling in behind the caboose.
MASON [OVER RADIO]: Deploy anchors.
Dropping down.
No outgoing distress signals. You're clear.
Hey. Looks like they got some good stuff here.
Whoa, cool. It's like some kind of matter phase shifter.
All right, coming up.
Hey, Big Bird. This doesn't belong to you.
Oh, God.
-Suit lady, what was that?! SPIDER SUIT: You told me to choose.
What? No, just set everything back to normal.
Activating all systems.
My head.
SPIDER SUIT: You appear to have a mild concussion.
Hey, so where am I right now?
I'm not sure.
The container walls are hindering my sensors.
Wait a minute.
They must have hijacked the truck and taken me to their evil lair.
Okay, suit lady, we're gonna have to fight our way out of this one.
Three, two, one.
What is this place?
Suit lady, where am I?
You're in the most secure facility on the Eastern Seaboard.
The Damage Control deep-storage vault.
No. Seriously? Argh!
The door will most likely remain closed until morning.
Morning?
Hey, suit lady. I kind of feel bad calling you "suit lady," you know?
I think I should probably give you a name.
Like Liz. No, no, no.
God, that's-- That's weird.
What about Karen?
SPIDER SUIT: You can call me Karen if you would like.
Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?
[GASPS] What?
Maybe we should run that refresher course.
KAREN: Ricochet web. -Ricochet web.
-Whoa. Cool. -Splitter web.
-Web grenade. -Web grenade!
Should I tell Liz that I'm Spider-Man?
Who is Liz?
Who's Liz? Heh. She's-- Heh, heh.
She's the best. She's awesome.
She's just a girl who goes to my school.
And, uh--
Yeah, I just-- I really want to tell her, but it's kind of weird, you know?
"Hey, I'm Spider-Man."
What's weird about that?
What if she's expecting someone like Tony Stark?
Imagine how disappointed she'd be when she sees me.
Well, if I were her, I wouldn't be disappointed at all.
Thanks, Karen.
It's really nice to have somebody to talk to.
Hey, how long we been here anyways?
-Thirty-seven minutes. -What?!
Thirty-seven minutes? That's insane.
I cannot take this anymore. I got to-- I gotta get out of here.
There's got to be something in here I can use.
Okay, let's see.
Nope.
That's awesome.
Oh. Hey, it's like the glowy thing.
That glowy thing is an explosive Chitauri energy core.
You mean, we've been carrying around a bomb?
It would require radiation to transform it into an explosive state.
No, no, no.
Hey! Please! Please, somebody let me out! Hey!
Karen, you have to help me override that time lock.
Okay, Karen, lower the voltage and run it.
Trial unsuccessful.
Okay, we're just gonna have to try every sequence.
LIZ: Ned, Peter, we're gonna be late. Come on, let's go.
Okay. Uh, hold on, hold on.
Initiating trial 247.
It worked. It works.
Please be sure all cell phones are turned off.
Thank you.
PETER: Karen, get me to decathlon as fast as possible.
KAREN: Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.
Across the street from the Washington Monument.
NED [ON RECORDING]: It's Ned. Leave a message. Call me back. The glowy thing's a bomb!
KAREN: There's a vehicle approaching on your right.
JUDGE: We have now entered sudden death.
The next correct answer wins the championship.
JUDGE: Midtown Tech?
Zero.
That is correct.
Midtown takes the championship.
FLASH: Woo-hoo! We won. LIZ: You guys, I am so proud of you.
FLASH: Told you we didn't need Peter. NED: Flash, you didn't answer a question.
-Taking it all in, Michelle? -Oh, yeah, I just, um--
I don't want to celebrate something that was built by slaves.
I'm sure the Washington Monument wasn't built by--
Okay.
-Enjoy your book. -Thanks.
-Oh, Ned, you're alive. -Peter, are you okay?
Where's the glowy thing? The glowy thing?
-It's safe. It's in my backpack. -Ned, listen, the glowy thing is dangerous.
You missed the decathlon. I covered for you.
-Listen. -We're at the Washington Monument.
-Peter, is that you? -Hey, Liz.
KAREN: Is that Liz? -Put Ned back on the phone.
KAREN: You should tell her how you feel. -You flake. You are lucky we won.
I want to be mad, but I'm more worried. Like, what is going on with you?
I have to talk to Ned. It's important.
All items on the belt, please. PETER: There's something in Ned's backpack.
It's dangerous. Don't let it go through an x-ray.
Liz? Liz! Damn it.
Can I be the one to tell Peter he's expelled?
The Washington Monument is 555 feet, five and one-eighth inches tall.
Notice how the marble and granite are cut around the stone.
No, no, no. Karen, what's going on up there?
KAREN: The Chitauri core has detonated...
...and caused severe structural damage to the elevator.
-Oh, no. -My friends are up there.
What? Uh, don't worry, ma'am, everything's gonna be okay.
Excuse me, excuse me. Oh, my God, that's tall.
Oh, my God. Look at the ceiling.
LIZ: Just stay calm, everyone.
Oh, we are all going to die here.
KAREN: Estimating 10 minutes before catastrophic failure.
We're freaking screwed.
Okay, I know that was scary, but our safety systems are working.
KAREN: The safety systems are completely failing.
We're very safe in here.
KAREN: The occupants are in imminent mortal danger.
Going as fast as I can!
MAN 1: Let's go. MAN 2: Give me your hand.
KAREN: You now have 125 seconds until catastrophic failure.
What?! Why?
Unexpected motion has caused the deterioration to escalate.
-How do I get in there? -Activating reconnaissance drone.
Whoa. Has that been there this whole time? That's awesome.
Locating optimal entry point.
Proceed to southwest window.
Karen, I'm on my way.
LIZ: There's a lot of glass here. MAN: You got this.
Keep coming, keep coming.
Okay. Oh, my God.
Okay.
KAREN: What's wrong? You've reached the southwest window.
-Why are you hesitating? -It's fine.
I've just never been this high before.
You have also not reinstalled your parachute...
...so a fall from this height would most likely be lethal.
Perfect.
Oh, my God.
Why is it not breaking?
It's four-inch ballistic glass. You'll have to create more momentum.
OFFICER 1: This is D.C. Metro Police. Identify yourself.
PETER: My friends are in there! Stop!
Return to the ground immediately.
-Okay, who's next? FLASH: Me, it's my turn.
NED: Flash, seriously? What are you doing?
-Come on. LIZ: Don't worry about the trophy.
OFFICER 1: Stand down!
Return to the ground immediately.
Return to the ground or we will open fire!
OFFICER 2: Go up, go up.
PETER: I got this.
Take my trophy.
OFFICER 1: This is your last chance.
PETER: I'm gonna die.
Break!
I did it. Whoa!
[IN NEW YORK ACCENT] Hey, how you doing? Don't worry. I got you.
-Yes! Yes. PETER [IN NORMAL VOICE]: Hey, hey.
-Big guy, quit moving around. -I'm sorry, sir.
MAN: Let's go, let's go!
Okay, okay.
LIZ: Mr. Harrington, go. BOY: Ned, come on.
PETER: This is your stop. -Come on, Liz.
PETER: Go, go, go. Everybody out. Move it, people. Move it, move it.
LIZ: Are you sure it's safe? HARRINGTON: Liz.
PETER: Liz!
You're okay. You're okay.
Okay.
LIZ: Oh, my God. -Good, good.
Come on up. Come on, you guys, stay back.
MAN 1: Come on in. MAN 2: You guys good?
[IN NEW YORK ACCENT] So is everyone okay?
KAREN: This is your chance, Peter.
Kiss her.
Thank you.
Are you really friends with Peter Parker?
I can finish the next order, but without any new materials from that truck....
Yeah, damn it.
We still have enough to do the Gargan deal though, right?
Yeah, but then that's it.
Maybe it is time that I built the high-altitude seal.
-Would you shut up about that? -It's only one job.
No.
Eight years, not a word from the feds, nothing from those...
...Halloween-costume-wearing bozos up there in Stark Tower.
And then all of a sudden, this little bastard in red tights shows up.
And he thinks he can tear down everything I've built.
Really?
I'm gonna kill him.
-I'm gonna find him-- -I found him.
REPORTER [ON TV]: The Spider-Man swooped in...
...heroically saving an Academic Decathlon team from Queens.
The identity of the masked hero is still unknown.
-Mom. WOMAN: Oh, kids. All right.
Peter. Come here, come here, come here.
This past weekend, Midtown's Academic Decathlon team...
...defeated the country's best to win the national championship.
Later that day, they also defeated death.
Explosion. Sally scream. Flash scream. Everybody screaming.
There were purple lasers and smoke. It was **** tight, like a Bon Jovi concert.
As you know, we made it out alive, and that's the important thing.
I couldn't bear to lose a student on a school trip.
Not again.
Thankfully, no one was seriously injured thanks to the Spider-Man.
-Thank you, Spider-Man. -Thank you, Spider-Man.
JASON: Up next: the Spider-Man mania is sweeping the school.
How can you show your spider spirit?
Dude, dude, dude.
What is it like being famous when nobody knows it's you?
-Crazy, dude. -It's crazy.
-Should we tell everyone? -No.
-Should I tell everyone? -No, dude. That's not a good idea.
-Okay, come on, we'll be late to class. -I'm not going to class.
You're already in trouble for ditching the decathlon.
Dude, listen, I figured it out.
The wingsuit guy is stealing from Damage Control.
What he takes from Damage Control, that's how he builds the weapons.
-So all I gotta do is catch him. -But we have a Spanish quiz.
Ned, I'm probably never gonna come back here.
Mr. Stark is moving the Avengers upstate...
-...so when I bring this guy in-- -Dude.
You want to be a high school dropout?
I am so far beyond high school right now.
Parker, my office.
So...
...you got detention.
You screwed up. You know what you did was wrong.
The question is, how are you gonna make things right?
Maybe you were trying to be cool.
But take it from a guy who's been frozen for 65 years...
...the only way to really be cool is to follow the rules.
We all know what's right. We all know what's wrong.
Next time those turkeys try to convince you of something...
-...you know is wrong... -Where you going? Get back here.
...just think to yourself, what would Captain America do?
Why are you here? You don't have detention.
Oh, I know. I just like coming here to sketch people in crisis.
It's you.
So your body's changing. Believe me, I know how that feels.
May?
Hey, Karen. What's up?
KAREN: Hey, Peter. How was your Spanish quiz?
I was wondering if you could help me.
I'm trying to figure out who the guys under the bridge were that night...
...but I can only remember part of a license plate.
I can run facial recognition on the footage of that encounter.
-Footage? -Yes, Peter.
I record everything you see.
-Everything? -Everything.
-All the time? -It's called the Baby Monitor Protocol.
Yeah, of course it is. Um....
-Yeah, just roll it back to last Friday. -With pleasure.
PETER [ON VIDEO]: Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party.
Hey, what's up, Liz? Peter's told me a lot about you.
No, no, no. This is just me messing around.
Go later in the day, later in the day.
PETER [IN BRITISH ACCENT]: It is I, Thor, son of Odin.
No, no, no. That's definitely--
That's definitely not what we wanted to watch.
KAREN: Your impressions are funny. -Fast-forward to the arms deal.
Okay.
The two on the right, who are they? KAREN: Searching law-enforcement databases.
No records found for two of the individuals.
-Nothing? KAREN: One individual identified.
Aaron Davis, age 33.
He has a criminal record and an address here in Queens.
Let's pay him a visit.
KAREN: Would you like me to activate the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?
Uh, yeah.
-[IN DEEP VOICE] Remember me? -Hey--
I need information. You'll give it to me now.
-All right, chill. -Come on!
-What happened to your voice? -What do you mean?
I heard you by the bridge. I know what a girl sound like.
I'm not a girl. I'm a boy. I mean, I'm a-- I'm a man.
I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl--
I'm not a girl. I'm a man.
Come on, man. Look, who is selling these weapons?
I need to know. Give me names or else.
-You ain't ever done this before, huh? -Deactivate Interrogation Mode.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Look, man.
These guys are selling weapons that are crazy dangerous.
They can't be out on the streets.
If one of them can cut Delmar's Bodega in half--
-You know Delmar's? -Yeah, best sandwich in Queens.
-Sub Haven's pretty good. -Eh, it's too much bread.
-I like bread. -Come on, man, please.
Stupid Interrogation Mode. Karen, don't ever do that again.
The other night, you told that dude, "If you shoot somebody, shoot me."
It's pretty ballsy.
I don't want those weapons in this neighborhood.
I got a nephew who live here.
Who are these guys?
What can you tell me about the guy with the wings?
Other than he's a psychopath dressed like a demon, nothing.
I don't know who he is or where he is.
-I do know where he's gonna be. -Really?
Yeah, this crazy dude I used to work with...
...he's supposed to be doing a deal with him.
Yes! Yes.
-Thank-- -Hey. Hey. Hey.
I didn't tell you where. You don't have a location.
Right, of course. Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just--
Yeah.
-Where is it? -Can I give you some advice?
-Hmm? -You gotta get better at this part of the job.
I don't understand.
I'm intimidating.
-Staten Island Ferry, 11. -Oh, that's soon.
That's gonna dissolve in two hours.
No, no, no. Come fix this.
-Two hours. You deserve that. -I got ice cream in here.
You deserve that. You're a criminal. Bye, Mr. Criminal.
Nice.
Okay, Karen, activate Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.
KAREN: Sure thing.
TOOMES: He's up front, main deck.
I hate this guy.
It's the guy from the bridge, right? Who's that other guy?
TOOMES: Just keep me posted.
KAREN: There's no record of him in my criminal database.
Incoming call from May Parker. Should I reroute to your heads-up display?
I can't talk right now. I'll call her back.
Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy. We can't let anybody get away this time.
PETER: Who's the guy on the left? KAREN: Mac Gargan.
Extensive criminal record, including homicide.
Would you like me to activate Instant Kill?
No, Karen, stop it with the Instant Kill already.
White pickup truck.
Dronie, scan the ship for a white pickup truck.
Oh, this is too perfect.
I got the weapons, buyers and sellers in one place.
KAREN: Incoming call from Tony Stark. -No, no, no.
-Don't answer. -Mr. Parker. Got a sec?
-Uh, I'm actually at school. KAREN: No, you're not.
-Nice work in D.C. -Okay.
My dad never really gave me a lot of support...
...and I'm trying to break the cycle of shame.
Uh, I'm in the middle of something.
Don't cut me off when I'm complimenting you.
Anyway, great things are about to--
TONY: What is that? -Uh, I'm at band practice.
That's odd. Happy told me you quit band six weeks ago. What's up?
-I gotta go. Uh, end call. -Hey.
I'll take those!
Hey, guys. The illegal-weapons-deal ferry was at 10:30. You missed it.
RANDY: Spider guy's here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast.
Are you guys okay? My bad. That was a little hard.
I got to say, the other guy was way better with that thing.
I'm honestly--
I'm-- I'm shocked.
MAN 1: Freeze! FBI. -Don't move.
MAN 1: Get on the ground. MAN 2: FBI.
What do you mean, FBI?
KAREN: Federal Bureau of Investigation. -I know, but what are they doing here?
Get out of the way. Get out of the way!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! No.
Look out, look out, look out. Move, move, move!
-Move. TOOMES: Get to the top deck.
We're getting out of here.
Activate Taser web!
You're messing with things you don't understand.
Oh, my God. What do I do? Karen...
...give me an x-ray of the boat and target all the strongest points.
Web grenade. Web grenade.
Splitter web, go.
KAREN: Great job, Peter. You are 98 percent successful.
-Ninety-eight? -Yeah, Spider-Man!
No, no, no.
What the hell?
What the hell?
Hi, Spider-Man.
Band practice, was it?
Yeah, Iron Man!
Uh, Mr. Stark.
Hey, Mr. Stark, could I do anything? What do you want me to do?
I think you've done enough.
TOOMES: So that's it. You're just gonna run?
Feds were waiting for us.
Now we're on Iron Man's radar?
Yeah, I'm running.
You should too.
You know I can't do that.
So now what?
Mason, can you get that high-altitude seal thing up and running in time?
Seriously?
Yes. You will not regret this.
You in?
TONY: Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch...
...I tell you to stay away from this.
Instead, you hacked a multimillion-dollar suit...
...so you could sneak around behind my back...
-...doing the one thing I told you not to do. -Is everyone okay?
TONY: No thanks to you.
No thanks to me?
Those weapons were out there, and I tried to tell you about it...
...but you didn't listen.
None of this would've happened if you had just listened to me.
If you even cared, you'd actually be here.
I did listen, kid. Who do you think called the FBI, huh?
Do you know I was the only one who believed in you?
Everyone else said I was crazy to recruit a 14-year-old kid.
-I'm 15. -No, this is where you zip it, all right?
The adult is talking. What if somebody had died tonight?
Different story, right? Because that's on you.
And if you died...
...I feel like that's on me.
-I don't need that on my conscience. -Yes, sir.
-I'm sorry. I understand. -Sorry doesn't cut it.
I just wanted to be like you.
And I wanted you to be better.
It's not working out. I'm gonna need the suit back.
-For how long? -Forever.
-Yeah, that's how it works. -No, no. Please.
-Let's have it. -Please, this is all I have.
I'm nothing without this suit.
If you're nothing without this suit, then you shouldn't have it.
Okay?
God, I sound like my dad.
I don't have any other clothes.
Okay, we'll sort that out.
Hey.
I've been calling you all day. You didn't answer your phone.
You can't do that.
Then this ferry thing happens.
I've called five police stations.
Five.
I called five of your friends. I called Ned's mother.
I'm fine. May, I'm okay. Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.
Cut the bullshit.
I know you left detention.
I know you left the hotel room in Washington.
I know you sneak out of this house every night.
That's not fine.
Peter, you have to tell me what's going on. Just lay it out.
It's just me and you.
I lost the Stark internship.
-What? -Yeah.
What happened?
I just thought that I could work really hard and he could-- He would-- You know.
But I screwed it up.
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
I'm sorry I made you worry.
I'm not trying to ruin your life.
Yeah, I know.
Just--
-I used to sneak out too. -Yeah.
And take a shower. You smell.
You smell like garbage.
I know.
Peter, you're a good kid and you're a smart kid...
...so just try to keep your head straight, okay?
Okay.
All right, get out of here.
Are you expelled?
Do you have to go to that high school where the principal has a crossbow?
Pretty sure that's an urban myth, and, no, I'm not expelled.
You're so lucky.
Hey.
-Hey. -I thought you had calculus fifth period.
Yeah, I was just doing some homecoming stuff.
Hey, look, I, uh--
I just wanted to apologize about the whole decathlon thing.
It's fine.
Last week, decathlon was the most important thing, but then I almost died.
No, I'm--
I just mean that...
...it was not cool, especially...
...because...
...I like you.
I know.
You do?
You're terrible at keeping secrets.
Yeah, you'd be surprised.
I got to get to class, but, um--
I'd say we should hang out, but I'm gonna be in detention for... -Uh-huh. -...ever, but, um--
-Uh-huh. -...ever, but, um--
I guess you already have a date to homecoming.
Actually, I was so busy planning it, I never really got around to that part, so--
Uh, do you want to...
...go with me?
Yeah. Sure.
Really? I mean, uh, great. Cool.
Cool.
I'm actually going that way.
Um....
May, I need your help.
♪ Sometimes you don't try Just now, now, now ♪
Through or around?
-Right? -Heh-heh.
MAY: It's game day. So, what's the plan?
-Open the door for her. -Mm-hm.
Tell her she looks nice, but not too much because that's creepy.
-Don't be creepy. -No.
When I dance with her, I'm putting my hands on her hips.
I got this.
-Love you. -Bye.
You must be Peter.
Yeah.
I'm Liz's dad.
Put her there.
Hell of a grip.
Come on in here. Come on.
Hi, Peter.
You look very handsome.
PETER: Thank you.
You got his name right?
-Freddie? -Peter.
-Peter. Peter. -Heh.
I'm gonna go get Liz.
Okay.
You all right, Pete?
Yeah.
Because you look pale.
You want something to drink?
A bourbon or a Scotch, or something like that?
I'm not old enough to drink.
That's the right answer.
-Wow, wow, wow. Do you look beautiful. -Please don't embarrass me, Dad.
Doesn't she, Pete?
Yeah, you look really good.
Once again, that's the right answer.
Is that a corsage?
Thanks.
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur, so, uh, let's get this show on the road.
No, no, no, we have to take some pictures, babe. All right.
-Oh, right here. Perfect. -Mom.
Okay. Come on, you guys.
Peter, closer.
Smile.
There you go.
-Sir, you don't have to drive us. -No, no, it's not a big deal.
I'm going out of town. It's right on my way.
-He's always going. Have fun. TOOMES: Last time.
LIZ: Thank you. TOOMES: Promise.
-He's cute. LIZ: Shh.
-See you in a couple of days. All right. -Bye, baby.
Come on, Pedro.
-Bye, Peter. Have fun. PETER: Yeah, I will.
TOOMES: What are you gonna do, Pete? -What?
When you graduate, what do you think you'll do?
-Oh, um, I don't know. -Don't grill him, Dad.
Just saying, you know.
All you guys who go to that school...
...you pretty much have your life planned out, right?
Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.
Peter has an internship with Tony Stark. I think he doesn't have to worry.
-Really? Stark? -Mm-hm.
So cool.
What do you do?
Yeah, actually, I don't intern for him anymore.
-Seriously? -Yeah, it got, um...
...boring.
It was boring? You got to hang out with Spider-Man.
Really? Spider-Man?
Wow. What's he like?
Yeah, he's nice.
Nice man.
Solid dude.
Look. So cute.
I've seen you around, right? I mean...
...somewhere. We've, uh-- Have we ever--? Because even the voice--
Um, he does Academic Decathlon with me.
-Oh. -And he was at my party.
It was a great party, really great, yeah.
-Beautiful house, a lot of windows. Heh. -You were there for, like, two seconds.
PETER: That was-- I was there longer than two seconds.
LIZ: You disappeared. -No. No, I did not disappear.
Yes, you did. You disappeared like you always do, like you did in D.C. too.
Whew. That's terrible what happened down there in D.C., though.
Were you scared?
I'll bet you were glad when your old pal Spider-Man...
...showed up in the elevator, though, huh?
Yeah, well, I actually didn't go up.
I saw it all from the ground.
LIZ: Yeah.
Very lucky that he was there that day.
Good old Spider-Man.
Dad, the light.
Here we are. End of the line.
Thanks, Dad.
You head in there, gumdrop.
I'm gonna give Peter the, uh, "dad" talk.
Don't let him intimidate you.
Love you.
-Love you, gumdrop. LIZ: Have a safe flight.
LIZ: Hi.
You guys look so pretty.
Does she know?
Know what?
So she doesn't. Good.
Close to the vest.
I admire that.
I've got a few secrets of my own.
Of all the reasons I didn't want my daughter to date....
Peter...
...nothing is more important than family.
You saved my daughter's life.
I could never forget something like that.
So I'm gonna give you one chance.
Are you ready?
You walk through those doors, you forget any of this happened...
...and don't you ever, ever...
...interfere with my business again.
Because if you do...
...I'll kill you...
...and everybody you love.
I'll kill you dead.
That's what I'll do to protect my family. Do you understand?
Hey.
I just saved your life. Now, what do you say?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Now, you go on in there and you show my daughter a good time, okay?
Just not too good.
Hey.
What did he say to you?
Gotta go.
I'm sorry.
You don't deserve this.
He gave you a choice.
-You chose wrong. -What the hell?
What's with the crappy costume?
My web-shooters.
I wasn't sure about this thing at first, but damn.
Ugh. Gross.
PETER: Why did he send you here? -Guess you'll never know.
PETER: Nice shot!
Yes!
Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz's dad.
-What? -I gotta tell Mr. Stark.
Call Happy Hogan. He's Mr. Stark's head of security.
Get a computer and track my phone.
-Will you be okay? -Hurry, we gotta catch him...
...before he leaves town.
I'm sorry about dinner...
...but I know when branzino's fresh, and that was not fresh, okay? So--
[IN GRAVELLY VOICE] Flash, I need your car and phone.
Uh, sir, technically, this is my dad's car, sir. So I can't--
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, can you hear me?
-Go for Ned. -Ned, I need you...
-...to track my phone. -Yeah, but where is it?
Genius move. Okay, he just passed the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.
Hey, where are the headlights on this thing? I'm in Flash's car.
-I'll pull the specs. -Okay, you're on speakerphone.
-You stole Flash's car. Awesome. -Yeah, it's awesome. It's--
Get out of the way, get out of the way! Move!
-Are you okay? -I've never driven before...
...only with May in parking lots. This is a huge step up.
Hey, have you gotten through to Happy yet?
Yeah. I'm working on it. I just gotta backdoor the phone system.
Guy in the chair.
HAPPY [ON SCREEN]: Takeoff in nine minutes.
-Hello? Hello? Who is this? -Uh....
-Mr. Happy, it's Ned. -Who?
I'm an associate of Peter Parker. Got something very important to tell you--
You gotta be shitting me.
Damn.
Hey, Ned, how we coming on with those headlights?
Round knob to the left of the steering wheel, turn clockwise.
Left, okay.
Okay, perfect. So where's my phone now?
He stopped in an old industrial park in Brooklyn.
What? That makes no sense. He said he was going out of town.
NED: Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy. Don't think he likes you, by the way.
It sounded like he was catching a flight.
He said something about taking off in nine minutes.
-What? -He was surrounded by boxes.
Boxes? It's moving day.
It's moving day. He's gonna rob that plane.
I gotta stop him!
HAPPY: All right, wheels up in eight minutes.
We just got to load Tony's old Hulkbuster armor...
...prototype for Cap's new shield, and the Meging--
The Meg-- The--
Thor's magic belt.
Okay, slow down. You're getting close. It's on your right.
-What? -Turn right.
-Peter. Are you okay? -Yeah.
Just keep trying to get through to Happy.
It's been an honor, Spider-Man.
What are you doing here? There's a dance.
I'm...
...looking...
...at porn.
Hey!
Surprised?
Oh, hey, Pete.
I didn't hear you come in.
It's over. I've got you.
You know, I gotta tell you, Pete...
...I really, really admire your grit.
I see why Liz likes you.
I do. When you first came to the house...
...I wasn't sure. I thought, "Really?" But I get it now.
PETER: How could you do this to her?
To her? I'm not doing anything to her, Pete.
I'm doing this for her.
Hm. Yeah.
Peter...
...you're young.
You don't understand how the world works.
But I understand that selling weapons to criminals is wrong.
How do you think your buddy Stark paid for that tower?
Or any of his little toys?
Those people, Pete, those people up there...
...the rich and the powerful, they do whatever they want.
Guys like us...
...like you and me...
...they don't care about us.
We build their roads, and we fight all their wars...
...and everything, but they don't care about us.
We have to pick up after them. We have to eat their table scraps.
That's how it is.
I know you know what I'm talking about, Peter.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I want you to understand.
And...
...I needed a little time to get her airborne.
I'm sorry, Peter.
What are you talking about? That thing hasn't even touched me yet.
True. Then again...
...wasn't really trying to.
MASON: Chief, they're powering up engines.
-Okay. Yeah, yeah. -Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, ready?
Hello?
Hello!
Please, hey.
Hey, please. I'm down here.
I'm down here. I'm stuck.
I'm stuck. I can't move. I can't--
TONY: If you're nothing without this suit, then you shouldn't have it.
Come on, Peter.
Come on, Spider-Man.
Come on, Spider-Man.
Come on, Spider-Man.
Come on, Spider-Man!
Launch for intercept. Green light. Green light.
Oh, yeah.
Retroreflective panels engaged.
Got a visual on the plane, but I'm feeling a little resistance.
MASON: It's probably just drag on the new turbines.
Look out for the cloaking cameras. Stay in the blind spots.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Deploying high-altitude vacuum seal.
This better work, Mason.
MASON: Trust me, boss, even one of those boxes and we are set for life.
Yeah.
MASON: You have 30 seconds to get to the cockpit...
...and override their security.
Cloning transponder signal.
Launching decoy drone.
Entering new coordinates.
HAPPY: Good, so it's on its way.
MAN: Yes, sir, right on course. -Okay, thank you.
All right.
Hot dog.
Just a typical homecoming...
...on the outside of an invisible jet...
...fighting my girlfriend's dad. Oh!
Oh, God!
I can't believe that worked. Whoa!
Chief, they're losing altitude. Get out of there.
I'm not going home empty-handed.
Oh, my God.
MASON: Get out. What are you doing? -Please turn, please turn!
Hey, Pedro.
Bingo.
Your wingsuit.
Your wingsuit's going to explode!
Time to go home, Pete.
I'm trying to save you!
No.
No.
It looked so insane. That whole--
Like, it was just crazy.
He-- He was just, like:
-And you were like, "Aah!" -Shh.
And then I just hit him with the: whoosh.
It was so-- Oh, my God.
I mean, you saved me.
It was awesome.
Hey, Liz.
I'm gonna miss you.
Bye.
PETER: Liz.
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.
You say that a lot. What are you sorry for this time?
The dance?
That, um, was a pretty crappy thing to do.
Well, yeah, but I--
I mean, your dad-- I can't imagine what you're going through.
If there's anything I can do to help....
I guess we're moving to Oregon.
Mom says it's nice there, so that's cool.
Anyways, Dad doesn't want us here during the trial. So....
Liz, I-- I--
Bye, Peter.
Whatever's going on with you, I hope you figure it out.
Congratulations, decathlon national champions.
-Yeah! -Ha-ha.
I'll have to put this back in the trophy case soon...
...but just for motivation right now at this practice.
I'm ahead of the game, but we will need...
...a new team captain next year.
So I am appointing Michelle.
Yeah!
Uh, thank you.
My-- My friends call me MJ.
I thought you didn't have any friends.
I didn't.
-I, uh, gotta go. -Hey, where you going?
What are you hiding, Peter?
I'm just kidding. I don't care. Bye.
-All right, so we should run some drills. NED: Yeah.
Hey, Happy. What, uh--? What are you doing here?
I really owe you one.
I don't know what I would do without this job.
I mean, before I met Tony--
So, uh, how long you been here?
Long enough to be awkward. Boss wants to see you.
-[WHISPERS] Is he here too? -In the toilet? No, he's upstate.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Upstate-- Like, "upstate" upstate?
Yeah, let's go.
Take a look.
It's pretty impressive, huh?
They just finished remodeling the whole thing.
-You don't see that every day. -Oh, there they are.
How was the ride up?
-Good. -Give me a minute with the kid.
-Seriously? -Yeah.
I gotta talk to the kid.
I'll be close behind.
How about a loose follow? All right? Boundaries are good.
Sorry I took your suit.
You had it coming. Actually, it turns out it was...
...the perfect tough-love moment that you needed.
To urge you on, right? Wouldn't you think? Don't you think?
-I guess. -Let's just say it was.
-Mr. Stark, I really-- -You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime.
But then you did the right thing.
Took the dog to the free clinic, you raised the hybrid puppies....
All right, not my best analogy.
I was wrong about you.
I think, with a little more mentoring...
...you could be a real asset to the team.
-To the--? To the team? -Yeah. Anyway...
...there's about 50 reporters behind that door. Real ones, not bloggers.
When you're ready...
...why don't you try that on?
And I'll introduce the world to the newest official member of the Avengers:
Spider-Man.
I....
TONY: Yeah, give that a look.
After the press conference, Happy will show you to your room...
...your new quarters.
Where's he between? He's next to Vision?
-Yeah, Vision's not big on doors. -It's fun.
Or walls.
You'll fit right in.
Thank you, Mr. Stark.
But I'm good.
You're good? Good--? How are you good?
Well, I mean, I'd rather just stay on the ground for a little while.
Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.
Somebody's got to look out for the little guy, right?
You're turning me down?
You better think about this. Look at that.
Look at me.
Last chance. Yes or no?
-No. -Okay.
It's kind of a Springsteen-y, working-class hero vibe that I dig.
Uh, Happy will take you home.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
Mind waiting in the car? I need a minute.
-Thank you, Mr. Stark. -Yes, Mr. Parker, very well.
-See you around. -Okay.
That was a test, right?
-There's nobody back there? -Yes, you passed.
-All right, skedaddle there, young buck. -Thank you, Mr. Stark.
TONY: Yeah, thank you.
Told you he's a good kid.
-Where's the kid? -He left.
-Everybody's waiting. -He actually made a mature choice.
-It just surprised the heck out of us. -Did you screw this up?
-He told the kid to go wait in the car. -Are you kidding?
I have a room full of people in there waiting...
...for some big announcement. What will I tell them?
Think of something. How about, um...?
-Hap, you still got that ring? -Do I--? I--?
-The engagement ring. -Are you kidding?
I've been carrying this since 2008.
Okay.
I think I can think of something better than that.
Well, it would buy us a little time.
Like we need time.
PEPPER: I can't believe you have that in your pocket.
-Want me to get the door for you, hon? -I got it.
PETER: Aunt May, did you do dinner already?
May?
What the fu--?!
GARGAN: Look who it is.
What are the odds you and I'd end up at the same summer camp?
Relax.
This? It's not on you.
It's on our, uh, little spider friend.
I've got some boys on the outside who would love to meet him.
You know, take a picture, slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.
And I heard a rumor.
You know who he is.
If I knew who he was...
...he'd already be dead.
Toomes, your family's here!
Hi, I'm Captain America, here to talk to you...
...about one of the most valuable traits a soldier or student can have.
Patience.
Sometimes patience is the key to victory.
Sometimes it leads to very little...
...and it seems like it's not worth it.
And you wonder...
Yes.
So-yeon.
So-yeon.
Give it a little time.
You'll be born again.
Gi-su!
Yang Gi-su!
Stop.
Let So-yeon go now.
I'm gonna bring her back.
She'll die anyway if you stop me.
-Sir, I will shoot you. -Gi-su.
Your horrific human experiments have taken over 100 lives.
This is not going to bring So-yeon back.
If you really want to save your daughter, let her go.
No, I've found a way. I've succeeded!
See here. I'm living proof.
I tested it on myself.
We can bring So-yeon back now.
Yang Gi-su!
No, you can't.
Don't touch it!
Take him away.
So-yeon is going to die. You're going to kill her!
STRONG EARTHQUAKE ALERT
So-yeon.
No!
BADLAND HUNTERS
What the hell?
Shit, I'm so fucked.
Help me! Someone help!
Get away from me!
Hey, come on over here.
I pretty much had that in the bag.
Who cares who bags it? Let's take it all.
That looks delicious.
I told you to let me know if there's any work to be done.
I'm fine, Su-na.
I just went out to get some air.
Grandma, you have bad knees.
Take a seat. I'll handle the rest.
I can't recall the last time it rained.
There's no drinking water around this area.
Su-na, why don't we find a car and move to Bus District?
I think
I'll just live here with you, Grandma.
It's not like we'd be safe there just because there are more people.
Remember when we got dragged off by those cannibals?
They also used to be kind people before the drought.
Not everyone in the world is evil like that.
Well, most of the people I've seen have been like that.
Su-na.
This is what I think.
You reap what you sow.
It may seem like there are many bad people,
but keep embracing people, and you'll definitely come across some nice ones.
That's what I believe.
You put way too much faith in people.
That might've been the case before the world ended.
Sadly, I don't really remember what things were like back then.
Actually, we might have to visit Bus District today.
-Oh, is today the day Nam San is coming? -Yeah.
How much longer do we have to put up with dirty water?
We haven't had a drop of rain for months.
This is nothing.
Last year, we had a drought for over six months.
Hey! We've got meat!
Hurry on over!
All right, line up, everyone! Line up!
Have your trading goods ready.
Hey, mister! Stand in line properly.
Okay.
Rubber boots.
-San. -Rubber boots?
Next.
No, that won't do.
Looks fine to me.
Here, take it.
Damn, you scared me.
This should be enough
to get me that entire tail portion.
The whole thing.
Can you eat this? Put it away.
Once this situation dies down and things get better,
-this will-- -You sure are optimistic, lady.
It's been over three years since the world ended.
It's time you accept reality!
Hey, here. At least take this. Here.
We really shouldn't do this, but we'll give it to you in secret.
Do I eat it raw?
Cook it first. It's venomous.
What is it?
-Rice. -Rice?
Thank you.
-Hello, Ji-wan. -Su-na!
Hello, mister.
Hey, Su-na. Hello, ma'am.
Hello.
You don't have to come all the way here.
We could've visited on our way home. It must be hard for your grandma.
Oh goodness. No, we should come.
Su-na owes her life to Nam San, after all.
It's already been three years.
We've relied on your help for so long, so I just feel bad.
You didn't have to.
Thank you, ma'am.
I'm just glad Su-na's grown up to be a fine person.
Thank you, mister.
Sure.
-Right, well, take some meat today. -Su-na.
I caught this alligator.
Are you sure it wasn't Mr. Nam San?
It really was me.
I'd like to trade this in, mister.
Your painting? Let's see now.
Wow, a masterpiece.
It's amazing.
-Thank you. -You're welcome.
Where's mine? I go out on hunts with him.
We should make way now. There are people waiting.
We should make way now. There are people waiting. I'm so sorry.
See you, mister.
Take care. Goodbye, ma'am.
-We'll be on our way. -See you.
Next.
Man, they've practically set up a fucking village here.
Living diligently, I see. Damn.
Listen up, residents of Bus District!
Let us introduce ourselves.
We're from Jamsil Police Station, okay?
Look at this. See this thing?
As long as you folks cooperate,
no one's going to get hurt, okay?
Fuck, no one's answering.
Well, the reason we are here…
Let's see. Here it is.
We're on the hunt for a notorious criminal,
and it just so happened
that we picked up on his scent in this neighborhood.
So I'd like to ask for your cooperation. Okay?
Wait. Hey.
Hey, that guy looks just like him. See?
-It looks like him. -Take him.
It's not me!
Hey, over there. Take the one covered in gold.
Let go. I'm a woman.
Yeah, I know. This guy's a woman.
He's a woman?
Hey! You!
Let's go.
Let go. Damn it.
You're strong, you fuck.
Are you really a cop?
What did we say? Cooperate, or you'll get hurt.
How old are you?
What's it to you?
I'm just glad to see you.
Kids your age have all but disappeared.
Please go away. You smell foul.
Let's go.
This crazy bitch.
-That bastard. -What did you say?
Stop it, you punk!
Seriously.
-Grandma! -You fucker!
Su-na, are you okay?
Hey, hold it.
Go.
Move.
What the fuck are you doing?
Die!
That tickles.
Are you the boss?
No, I'm not the boss, sir.
Then who's your boss?
Well, it's Tiger, sir.
Tiger? That prick is still alive?
Hey, where did you get this water?
From the apartment, sir.
-Apartment? -Yes, sir.
I've gone far beyond this area but never seen apartments.
I'm not lying, sir.
It's quite far from here,
surrounded by unusual terrain, so it's rather hard to see.
There's clean water there, sir.
Listen, if you ever come here again, I'll kill you all. Got it?
Yes, sir. I understand.
Make sure you tell Tiger.
Yes, sir.
But who should I say you are?
Nam San.
Oh, you're the Nam San.
Yes, sir. I understand.
Hey, get up.
I'm so sorry, sir.
Hurry up!
Are you okay? And you, ma'am?
I'm fine. How about you?
I'm all right.
You're cute.
Nam San.
You know, all that talk earlier might not have been complete bullshit.
What talk?
Well, that prick said he got that water from an apartment.
Apparently, the place really exists. People are dying to go there.
I heard it's packed with people and practically heaven on earth.
You should go if you want.
I'm just curious. That's all.
Besides, you don't get to just go there.
Only the chosen ones get to enter.
Who are those punks?
Su-na!
Hey.
Who are you guys?
It's fine. They're not bad people.
It's really okay, mister.
She's a teacher.
What teacher?
Hello. Nice to meet you.
We happen to have a safe place set up in Seoul.
I'm a teacher and the leader of a volunteer group there.
They must be from the place I mentioned earlier.
But why us?
We're prioritizing the protection of families with children in their teens.
We believe we must protect our youth for humanity's future.
Su-na, if you come with us,
your grandmother will live a long, healthy life.
We have clean water and food ready for you.
Clean water?
Oh my, thank the Lord.
Such an amazing place must be a target of gangs.
How will you ensure safety?
We have an armed security force with ex-military personnel.
Gangs roaming the wastelands wouldn't dare make a move on us.
Could these two join us as well?
They're like family to me.
I'm sorry.
We're only accepting immediate family.
Ma'am, have you not decided yet?
I hope you can make the right decision for Su-na's sake.
If you pass on this, other children may take the spot.
Well, my grandma's rather unwell, so she won't be able to walk for too long.
We have medical staff at the halfway point
to ensure the safe transport of those with health issues.
She's right. Let's go, Su-na.
Anywhere should be better than here.
That's right. You should live in a better place.
I'll come to see you.
Okay.
You too, mister. Please come to see me.
Yes, I'll do that.
Just a second, Grandma.
Mr. Nam San.
Thank you for all your help.
Don't mention it. Take care, ma'am.
Keep well, ma'am.
It's just a practice sketch.
Thank you.
It'll be hard to walk once the sun sets. Let's hurry now.
Oh, okay.
-Grandma. -Okay.
When did she get such a good look at me?
Su-na definitely has a crush on me, right?
As if.
What joy is there in life now that Su-na has left us?
This place is too dangerous for Su-na to live.
Events like today's happen far too often.
Well, you could keep her safe in the future, like today.
Me, protect someone? I couldn't even keep my own daughter safe.
Jeez.
You're at it again.
But Su-na sure does look a lot like your daughter.
Wait!
If you get married and adopt me, wouldn't we also get into that apartment?
Right?
How about the lady covered in gold?
-Hey. -I'm dead serious.
The world might've ended, but I can't just give up on life.
-My love just wasn't meant to be. -Jesus Christ.
A loving married couple resemble each other. You two already look alike.
Besides, she'd look stunning with makeup.
Hey, she put the snake in her nose. Who does that?
That's enough, okay? Enough.
Going somewhere?
You're blabbering too much. I'm going out.
On a night hunt?
-Yeah. -Let me come with you.
Grandma, are you okay?
Yes, I'm all right.
-Don't mind me. -Mind your step.
Don't worry. They're from our volunteer group.
Oh, right.
They're families from the west.
Thank you for your hard work.
Thank you all for coming this far.
Nice to meet you.
Follow me carefully this way, please.
I'm Lee Ju-ye. I'm 18. You?
I'm Han Su-na. I'm also 18.
Really? Wanna be friends?
Sure, let's be friends.
I haven't met a friend my age in a really long time.
Same.
There wasn't anyone my age in my neighborhood either.
Where did you live?
I lived in a tent near Bus District with Grandma.
Nice to meet you, Ju-ye.
My parents made me live underground because it wasn't safe outside.
That must've been rough.
Most of it was bearable,
but the bugs and rats would crawl up my body.
I had to keep moving my arms and legs
in case they mistook me for a corpse and tore into me.
At least we can put that kind of life behind us now.
Yeah, I heard the place is amazing.
I'll take a shower as soon as I get there.
It still feels like the bugs are on my skin.
I wonder if Su-na's there yet.
I wish I could go there with Su-na.
Man, I really don't want to let her go.
We can just go see her.
Nope.
That lady in gold.
The stepmom I'd really like.
Hey, okay. I won't.
Careful.
Grandma, are you all right?
Let's stop for a moment.
Let's take Su-na's grandmother
and your father to the medical station I mentioned earlier.
It's dangerous terrain from here on. We wouldn't want you to strain yourselves.
Mr. Oh and Mr. Choi here are going to take you there.
Thank you.
Thank you so much for taking such good care of us.
Please take good care of my grandma.
Of course. You don't have to worry.
Mr. Choi.
I'll take good care of her.
-I'll take him from here. -Thank you.
Slowly.
Father, I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
All right, let's be off now, then.
Su-na, don't worry about me and go on ahead.
Idiot.
Nothing here. Let's just check our snare trap.
Okay.
These are our vehicles.
We can take the cars from here.
Excuse me.
If the cars were this close, we could have taken my grandma with us.
We can wait, then.
Everyone walked all night. A few more hours of waiting won't hurt.
Right, everyone?
Mom, I'm thirsty.
We don't have any water.
Hang in there.
Oh my, what do we do?
We'll send a car back here tomorrow.
Please don't worry.
Let's get going, everyone.
Get in, everyone.
-Thank you. -Sure.
Oh my, you must be exhausted.
Don't worry too much about your grandma. I'm sure she'll be fine.
Get a head count.
There are still people doing such good things these days.
Goodness, he's right. I'm sorry for all the trouble.
Don't mention it.
All right, we've reached our destination.
Where's the medical facility?
Down there.
Is that Grandma?
Grandma!
Grandma. Wake up, Grandma!
What's with these bastards?
What the hell?
Come at me, dickhead.
Why did you kill Grandma?
Useless ones deserve to die.
You fucking son of a bitch!
Su-na. Where is she?
Just die!
Ji-wan!
Who the hell are you?
San, we have to go now. Su-na is in danger.
Calm down. Let's clean this place first.
Are you leaving Grandma like that?
We're almost there, everyone.
Please pack your personal belongings.
You came here to see me?
Yes, I need your help.
I must save the apartment's residents and my subordinates.
So why did you come to us for help?
So why did you come to us for help? Also, what's with these bastards? And the apartment?
Hey, you stay out of this.
Help me, please.
They didn't seem human. Chopping their heads off will kill them?
That's right.
What are these things?
My name is Lee Eun-ho. I was a sergeant in a CCU Air Force special ops unit.
I was a sergeant in a CCU Air Force special ops unit.
-Heading down to find survivors. -Yes, sir.
We were watching from the sky on the day of the great earthquake.
During our search for survivors, we found an apartment that hadn't collapsed.
Our unit struck an aquifer there.
And with the survivors, we did our best to rebuild the apartment.
But one day,
this man came to us.
Yang Gi-su.
The only doctor who survived.
He was helpful as a doctor,
but one day, he showed his true colors.
Dr. Yang, I came to check something.
Some parents have complained.
Their children never came back after you took them.
What's going on?
Lee Eun-ho, what do you think you're doing?
Hurry up and explain.
Sergeant Kwon.
Don't you think it's time for Sergeant Lee to know too?
Eun-ho, there's no hope in this world.
Now we must…
put our faith in Dr. Yang.
I merely gave him some advice,
along with a little gift.
-What are you doing now? -Take a look.
This is Dr. Yang's latest breakthrough.
Sergeant Lee Eun-ho?
Look at me.
I mean, how do you think someone like me managed to survive
that horrible great earthquake.
I once went two or three months without any water.
I am the future of humanity.
This apartment won't last long anyway. Everyone's going to die.
Failure to embrace change means everyone dies.
I'll help you survive.
You crazy bastard.
Where are the children?
-Take her away. -Where?!
Calm down.
Let me go, you bastard!
Hey, Lee Eun-ho!
It seems Yang Gi-su has been conducting strange experiments on people.
They ended up that way because of the experiments.
-If you help me-- -Hey.
I'm going to go get Su-na now.
If you get in my way, I'm going to kill you first.
Got it?
Our apartment has over 30 families residing in it,
and it can provide them with electricity with the solar panels we set up.
LET US FORGE A NEW FUTURE
Is that lettuce?
I see tomatoes too.
WELCOME, NEW RESIDENTS
WELCOME TO THE FUTURE OF NEW HUMANITY
Please make way.
Dr. Yang Gi-su is coming out.
Hello, everyone.
My name is Yang Gi-su, and I'm in charge of this place.
Welcome, everyone.
You must've endured numerous hardships out there
where conditions were truly dreadful.
You all went through so much out there where countless barbarians roamed freely.
But you don't need to worry anymore.
We will be providing you with clean water and food,
and we will keep you safe from outside threats.
Right. Get them some water first.
That's clean water we purified in this apartment.
My grandma should be arriving soon.
Can I have one more, please?
Thank you.
They've been taking children, just like they took Su-na.
They must be the subject of the experiment.
Those sons of bitches! Damn it!
Let's go. We gotta save Su-na now!
Got a death wish?
Rushing in recklessly won't help.
Their security is tighter than you'd expect.
They shoot trespassers on sight.
Come daybreak, I'll take care of the guards at the main gate
and keep the others distracted.
If you get into the underground prison and rescue my associates,
we can join forces.
You sure we can trust these associates of yours or whatever?
Again with the disrespectful language, punk-ass kid.
How old are you?
I'm fucking 18, woman.
-You wanna die? -Damn it. Let go!
Hey, stop it, or you'll grow to like each other.
Let's think this over.
Amen. Yeah.
Boss, I've taken care of them all.
Hurry up and fight!
Hey, man.
-Go at it. -Hey.
Wanna see your wife squirt blood all over?
Fuck, we lost again!
Hey, Pung-gi.
Got anything left to wager?
You fat-ass, chrome-dome prick.
There's one left, for fuck's sake.
Man, I saved your ass from life in prison, only to have you disrespect me like this.
Man, I saved your ass from life in prison, only to have you disrespect me like this. -Show some respect, prick. -Fuck them up!
-Show some respect, prick. -Fuck them up!
You motherfucker. Come here.
Fuck.
Tiger!
What, you bastard?
Hey, fucking kill them all!
Everyone stop!
Where's Tiger?
Look who it is.
It's been a while, Nam San.
There's that bastard. Red and plump like a sweet potato.
Sir, that's the bastard.
He's a beast.
Thanks to you, I quit boxing and got totally fucked over.
I've waited my whole life for this, and you just walk up to your own grave.
I came here to ask you something, but I changed my mind
since I don't like your attitude.
-I'll beat you up like the old days. -We're not in the ring anymore.
Street fighting is different, you son of a bitch!
Hey, Pung-gi.
If you bring down that gorilla, I'll give you half my slaves.
Half?
You're next once I've killed that prick, you fat bastard.
Kill that gorilla!
That fucker.
Hurry! Get out of there!
Wait.
Damn. That really hurts.
-It hurts so much. -Get up. Come here.
Hey, run!
Hey!
Oh God, my chin hurts so badly.
Hello.
Could you please tell me when my grandma will be arriving?
Grandma?
Whose grandma?
We sent them a ride this morning, so she should arrive before dinnertime.
Don't worry. Why don't you return to your spot?
Okay.
Aren't you trying too hard for a kid?
Children are our hope.
We can't let them down.
Our hope is Dr. Yang Gi-su, okay?
Today is the day we announce the much-anticipated cumulative grades.
First place,
Kim Hak-yong.
Unit 604. Lee Gyu-yeon, Unit 607.
Third place. Choi Ju-yeong, Unit 601.
Fourth place. Jang Chang-su, Unit 608.
Excuse me.
What grades is he talking about? We're new here.
The family of the student who comes first
gets assigned to the nicest apartment unit.
I'm so jealous of you.
My child always comes last.
Family members of the student with top grades
will be exempted from work and given a free meal pass.
Family members of Kim Hak-yong, please step forward.
-Congratulations. -Thank you.
Thank you.
You can also come in first, right?
Of course.
Students are our hope!
Students are our future!
Everyone, please have faith in your children and cheer them on!
All right, it's time to say your goodbyes.
As we explained before, students will live on the eighth floor.
-What? -What?
You never mentioned that.
We explained it to your grandmother. Didn't she tell you?
Does that mean I won't live with my grandma?
Does that mean we can't see Ju-ye?
If you sign up for a meeting, I'll make sure you get to see her.
Can we see her anytime by signing up?
Of course.
I'll get going now. I'll be sure to come first.
Don't skip any meals, okay?
-Let's go. -Look after her.
Right, please take good care of her.
As for the parents, please follow me.
Listen to your brother. We'll see you soon.
-Okay. -Seong-won, take good care of Gyu-rin.
Okay.
This way.
This is the clean water that our children drink.
If you look here, you'll see the steps we take
to filtrate the spoiled water to make the potable water we drink.
It's the most precious water.
San, they even have guns here.
Right.
Hey, where did you guys get these guns and water?
You got them from the apartment, didn't you?
-You don't know? -Well, do we know where we got it?
What?
So, do you know?
I don't know. Not me.
Okay. Take a nap, then.
What about you?
-I don't exactly… -Lights out.
-You? You don't know, do you? -No.
What about you?
You don't know.
What about you? Do you know? You don't?
You don't know anything. -I actually do. -You don't.
-I actually do. -You don't. I'm the only one who goes to make deals. You're going to need me, sir.
I'm the only one who goes to make deals. You're going to need me, sir.
Excuse me.
Do we have to do this work every day?
This is what we do all day.
They have a monopoly on all the water.
Really clean water at that.
They have a monopoly on it?
Yes, and with that comes power.
All they have to do is sit on their asses
while gangs like us bring goods to them for some water.
And what do you bring them?
People.
At first, they were fine with us bringing in anyone,
but now they only want us to bring in children. -Kids in their teens. -Why children?
-Kids in their teens. -Why children?
Well, I don't know about that.
And you still sold people to them?
-Hey. -What the…?
-Hold up. -Come on, relax.
When you came to Bus District
and tried to fucking take Su-na, that was why?
and tried to fucking take Su-na, that was why? -Yeah. -You son of a bitch.
Hey, relax.
Hey, pals. Why are you so hotheaded?
-Hey, let it go. -Let me go, okay?
There, there. Let it go.
We had to make a living too.
So? How do you guys enter the premises?
We…
can only enter on delivery days.
The days we deliver the goods.
Delivery days?
All right, you must be tired talking. Take a nap.
Well, I'm actually not that tired.
Nah, take a nap.
Mr. Choi took care of the children's elderly guardians.
The new children, both 18-year-old girls, are Han Su-na and Lee Ju-ye.
With our two new recruits, we have a total of 19.
They're a lot healthier than we expected.
-I see. Please keep a close eye on them. -Okay.
They probably didn't drink clean water for a while. You know what to do.
I'll have everything ready.
I'll visit them this evening.
You can go now.
You should wipe your face.
Just go.
Hello, everyone.
Here. Come this way.
Stand here.
Attention. Bow. Nice to meet you.
All right, everyone. Today, we have new friends joining us.
-Introduce yourself first, Ju-ye. -Okay.
My name is Lee Ju-ye. I'm 18, and I like eating.
I'm 18, and I like eating.
I don't like bugs.
Nice to meet you all.
Wow, let's give her a hand. It's so nice to have you.
And you, Su-na.
Su-na?
Don't be nervous. Just talk comfortably.
My name is Han Su-na.
I like drawing, and I don't like…
communal life.
Wow, let's give her a round of applause!
You can go sit in those empty seats over there.
-Okay. -Off you go.
Hello.
All right, today,
we'll be learning about the purposes of metabolic changes.
Open your books.
Let's first discuss the current human body structure.
Our physical limitations meant we had to drink water
and consume food in order to survive,
so we've wasted so many resources on people who were of no help.
These are known weaknesses.
And with a shortage of water in our current world,
humanity needs a new body structure that can overcome these weaknesses.
Our goal is to come up with a new metabolic system,
allowing us to create a breed of humanity
capable of surviving for a long time without water and sustenance.
We aim to increase the gradually declining human population
so that we can open up the possibility of returning to a civilized society.
Therefore, with both water and food scarce in this world,
you must never forget Dr. Yang Gi-su's mercy
and do your duty.
Once we improve our metabolic systems through Dr. Yang's research,
humanity will finally be given a body that can adapt to this new world.
Focus, Su-na.
I don't understand.
People outside don't even have enough water to drink,
but people here drink freely and even take showers.
Everyone here goes on and on about Dr. Yang Gi-su,
but why won't Dr. Yang Gi-su share water with those people?
Su-na.
The outside world is full of barbarians.
Dr. Yang lost his beloved daughter because of people like that.
To be a part of the new humanity,
you need the right qualifications.
What kind of qualifications are needed?
People that help with the doctor's research.
I'd also like to help with the doctor's research.
It seems you have what it takes, Ju-ye.
Please help Su-na understand, Ju-ye.
Yes, ma'am.
Now, for our next lesson,
we'll learn about organisms that excel at survival.
Dr. Yang will be visiting us later on,
so let's all express our gratitude by giving him a hearty welcome.
Yes, ma'am.
You know this food comes from your parents' hard work, right?
Let us all dig in with a thankful heart.
And there's water, the world's most precious thing.
Make sure to drink it all down to the very last drop.
Dr. Yang Gi-su had them specially purified for you all.
Ju-ye.
Hello, everyone.
A round of applause, everyone.
Attention. Bow.
"Students are our hope."
Surely you know our apartment's motto.
That's why we're supplying our students with special food and water.
As you know, we live in a world with a great shortage of food and water.
I'm working day and night in order to create a world
in which we'll be able to survive on only a small amount of food and water.
Until that day comes, please make sure to finish everything
and not leave any precious food or water.
Yes, sir.
-Yes? -Doctor.
Oh, there?
-Her name is? -It's Lee Ju-ye.
-Lee Ju-ye. -Yes, sir.
-Eighteen years old? -Yes, sir.
I heard that you wanted to help in my research.
Let's have a consultation right away today.
-Right. Of course. -Okay.
Why don't we have you eat first?
I'll send someone over in three hours, so come to my lab.
Thank you, Doctor.
-Right. -Let's go.
Excuse me.
Has my grandmother arrived?
She has. Don't worry.
Let me see her, then.
Ms. Kim.
Haven't you explained it to her yet?
I'm sorry, sir.
Su-na.
Your grandmother's a lot sicker than we expected,
so she'll need to be treated for two to three days.
Is Grandma that unwell?
She just needs some rest.
You'll be able to see her in a day or so.
Dr. Yang Gi-su is personally treating her, so don't--
I'm personally taking care of her, so she will be a lot better.
So don't you worry about a thing. And…
She's Su-na.
Su-na, you're terribly malnourished right now, okay?
So eat well and regain your health.
Here.
All right, enjoy your dinners.
And don't forget that you are our future.
-All right. Wrap it up. -Yes, sir.
It's been over 20 hours.
Sergeants Choi and Oh haven't returned.
Further delays could be dangerous.
It's fine. For now.
Maybe we should hand out personal syringes for situations like this.
It's too dangerous for an individual to carry yet.
Besides, there's no telling what kind of side effects we'll see.
How long do we have to subsist on these injections?
We're running out of children to bring.
We're almost there.
Just hang in there.
Get back to work now.
All they care about is themselves.
Human dignity? A thing of the past!
My research must see fruition as soon as possible
so we can dream of a more meaningful life.
And when that day comes, people will accept and value
the sacrifices of the evolutionary rejects as necessities.
That day will come, won't it?
It's time to change shifts.
Excuse me.
We applied for a meeting with our child earlier.
Where can we meet her?
A meeting? What meeting?
The teacher said we could see our daughter once our daily shift was over.
There's no such policy here.
She definitely told us earlier.
If Ju-ye can't visit here, we'll go to her.
The eighth floor is off-limits to regular residents. You can't go there.
Well, where's the teacher?
No, you know what? Where's my daughter?
What do you mean we can't go see our child?
It was agreed!
-They can't see their kids. -I hope ours are okay.
Don't mind us. Change shifts.
Let's talk tomorrow.
Hey, wait. Where is our daughter?
Where is she, you bastards?
How many times have I told you not to interrupt while I'm experimenting?
Sorry, sir. Too many witnesses made it hard to manage.
After all it took us to get these kids.
They're in the purification facility?
Sergeant Kang, please go upstairs and prepare the drugs and catheter.
Yes, sir.
Fuck me, this is so embarrassing.
Let me see my daughter!
Why would you lie to us? Why?
The teacher told us we could see her tonight!
Go check with her.
-Please calm down. -Ask her.
Please let go. Where's the teacher?
Why do you keep lying to us?
What's all this, then?
What's going on here?
Doctor, where is Ju-ye?
You said we could see her! You can't go back on something like that!
Sir, Ju-ye's doing fine.
Sir, Ju-ye's doing fine. She's doing great.
Doctor, please let us see Ju-ye.
Doctor, please let us see Ju-ye. Come on, don't be like this.
Come on, don't be like this.
Please settle down.
Fine. Why don't we all go to my lab?
I'll let you see Ju-ye.
Let's go. Okay?
Let's go.
REPTILE REGENERATION EXPERIMENT
EXPERIMENTED ON FIVE SOLDIERS
SEVEN 10-YEAR-OLDS, ALL DEAD FOUR 17-YEAR-OLDS, ALL DEAD
Ju-ye.
Ju-ye.
Come this way.
So, is our daughter here?
Why would…
See? Your daughter's fine.
-Ju-ye! -Ju-ye!
Now, please don't stimulate Ju-ye!
It'll put her life at risk.
Ju-ye is a valuable asset to our apartment,
performing her duties admirably.
Doctor, what is all this?
Is Ju-ye sick or something?
No, she's not sick.
Kids her age have something special right here.
"Children are our hope." You know our apartment's motto, right?
Now, look. This is my daughter.
Everyone said she was dead, but I brought her back.
I've essentially created an immortal human.
What?
The birth of a new humanity rests on your daughter's shoulders.
Do you now understand the significant role she plays in my research?
Ju-ye!
Hold on! I told you not to stimulate your daughter!
I told you not to touch her! For goodness' sake!
-What's wrong with Ju-ye? -Jesus!
What's wrong with our daughter?! What's wrong?!
-Ju-ye! -I told you not to touch her!
Oh God, do something!
Do something!
What's wrong with her?!
What's wrong with Ju-ye?!
What's wrong with you, Ju-ye?
-Is our daughter dead? -Wake up.
Ju-ye.
I was away for too long.
I told you not to interrupt!
-Ju-ye. -Ju-ye?
Ju-ye!
-Look what happened. -Ju-ye!
You have no idea how important this research is, do you?
I fed you and provided you with shelter, didn't I?
But you couldn't stand it?!
Send the cleanup crew to the lab.
Su-na, what are you doing here?
Great timing.
Thank you for coming with me.
I'm so grateful to have met such good people.
I'm just here to bring Su-na back.
Besides,
he won't stop whining without Su-na around.
I'm not a good person.
There's a lot of blood on my hands.
Morning's here.
Get up, Ji-wan.
We're leaving already?
It must be nice to be so young.
The drugs work great on you, and you don't even have side effects.
I know why you need all those children.
You're using us as lab rats just so you can survive.
Don't worry.
I won't let you die so easily.
Our survival depends on children.
We sometimes encounter hiccups, like with Ju-ye.
What the hell are you doing to the kids' heads?
At your age, the pituitary glands contain something vital to my research.
Of course, I need to tweak it a bit before I can use it.
You know the water you drink in the classroom? That does the trick.
Isn't it amazing
that we can achieve it with just some drinking water?
What about my grandma?
You seriously believed there was a medical facility?
The weak among us must be weeded out
for a new humanity to arise.
Stay still.
Hey, don't screw up.
Just trust me, sir.
-How've you been? -What's with your face?
A few days ago, I got into a fight with some crazy gorilla bastard.
What brings you here?
I came to deliver the goods.
I told you to only come on delivery days.
Damn it.
Well, you know, I was just passing by,
so I thought I'd make a delivery and catch up with you.
Get that out of my face.
-Check the back. -Yes, sir.
Shut off the engine.
What's going on?
Hold tight, everyone!
Slow down!
No!
Hey, you son of a bitch!
Crazy bastard! You're mad!
Ji-wan!
We saw those people when we went to pick Su-na up.
Inform the doctor.
Okay.
Sergeant Lee will go to the prison.
Don't follow her inside.
I've prepared a gift for her.
Move in, hurry!
Please don't kill me. I'm sorry!
You don't have to shoot me too.
This way.
Fuck, thank God I didn't get shot.
Try to relax, Su-na.
What is it now?
Dr. Yang.
I'm sorry, but this is urgent.
Sergeant Lee is with two of the hunters from Su-na's village.
I'm sure Sergeant Kwon will take care of it.
I guess your friends are here to see you, Su-na.
I doubt you'll see them.
-You sure it's this way? -Yes, I'm sure.
Then why aren't they on our tail?
Guys, it's me. Are you all right?
San!
Hey!
Get up.
Your subordinates don't seem too fond of us.
Hey, get a grip.
These things aren't human.
Snap out of it!
You guys still alive?
What were these monsters anyway?
The operation's a bust.
I'm sorry.
To all residents of the apartment, as you know, intruders are threatening
the safety of our apartment and its residents.
Please stay in your homes.
Do not leave your homes under any circumstances.
We've enhanced security
in the classrooms and student dorms, so don't step outside no matter what.
Lastly,
I'd like to inform our intruders in the basement level,
Sergeant Lee Eun-ho and the hunter person,
that you won't be able to achieve your goals,
so give up and leave now.
Then I'll spare your lives.
That fucking prick.
I'm giving you one last chance.
There's an intercom in the basement. Press the button and give me an answer.
If you'd like to walk away alive, that's number one.
Or if you'd like to be trapped forever in the basement,
that's number two!
We pick one.
But we'll be taking Su-na.
Let's go get Su-na.
You're coming, right?
Sergeant Kwon.
Do not let them up to my room, no matter what.
I understand, sir.
Team A, to the stairs, and Team B, to the basement.
I'll take the center. Don't let them come up, no matter what.
Pray that your friends don't interrupt this experiment, okay?
If you also end up dying,
we have no one left to take your place.
So, hang in there, okay?
What do we do?
We're almost out of ammo.
Hey, grab their weapons.
Go find Su-na. I'll handle things here.
-Will you be okay? -Just go.
Be careful.
Damn it.
Where is it? Damn it.
Hey, Ji-wan!
What's going on?
Let's go up.
Keep up, Eun-ho!
Keep going up.
-What about you? -Just go!
Lee Eun-ho.
Please don't kill us. We're just workers!
I'm looking for a kid named Su-na.
Where are the new kids?
The children are all on the eighth floor.
You guys should also hurry and find your children.
Lee Eun-ho.
You're still too busy helping others to find a way out for yourself.
Su-na.
Don't shoot. Why are you doing this?
Oh God, my knees.
It's time for you to accept reality.
The world we knew no longer exists.
We should create a new world together.
The world I want
is one without people like you in it.
So, Lee Eun-ho, you insist on taking this to the very end.
What is it?
Where is Han Su-na?
Where is she?!
She's in the laboratory.
Lead the way.
You kids get out of here. Don't you want to see your parents?
-Hurry up. -Hey.
Take another step, and I'll blow her brains out.
Go ahead. She won't live much longer anyway.
Hey, Sergeant Kwon. Have you lost your mind?
Hey, soldier boy!
Why aren't the elevators working here?
Go. I'll take care of him.
What's with this prick?
Is that makeup on your face?
So, you're the hunter?
What else would I be? A lover?
Funny.
I've been looking for you.
Yeah. I'm in a rush. Let's make it quick.
Daddy did it.
You waited for too long, right?
Right.
You monster.
Do you really think
this is the way to save your daughter?
You truly are amazing, Su-na.
Subjects usually take much longer to wake up.
It must be nice to be so young.
My grandma told me…
that people…
all reap what they sow.
You're going to pay
for everything you've done.
Do you think…
your daughter would accept
what you've become?
Want me to slice off your tongue?
Tweaking the composition was important, right?
You know that strange water you gave me?
I didn't drink any of it.
Why you…
Isn't it amazing
that we can achieve something to this effect?
Oh God! Doctor!
Don't come any closer.
Drop the gun.
Drop it!
Fuck.
You crazy bastard.
-Get So-yeon first. -Sorry?
-I said get So-yeon ready first! -Yes, sir.
Why won't you bastards just die?
You can't kill me.
Damn, that's one ugly mug.
Kim Hak-yong!
Hak-yong!
-Oh my, Hak-yong. -Are you all right?
What's wrong? What happened to you?
Ji-wan!
All right, let's go.
Come on. Hurry.
Oh no!
Doctor.
Please save me.
You said that you would save me. The shot.
Where's the shot? The shot.
You're going to die anyway.
No, don't do it. Please don't.
Hey, you son of a bitch!
What just happened up there?
It's okay. You'll be fine.
We can start all over again. You trust your dad, right?
What's going on?
Hey, Ji-wan!
Ji-wan!
Hey! Wake up. Come on.
Su-na.
Su-na, are you all right?
Mister.
Let's get out of here quickly.
Those bastards.
I told them to stay inside, but they all crawled out.
Dr. Yang!
It's Dr. Yang!
Doctor, what just happened in there?
Our child is still inside!
Don't ask me! Get out of my way!
We did everything you told us to! What have you done to our kids?!
Let go of me!
You've all been living in luxury by mooching off your kids.
-His face… -Now you wanna act like good parents?
So-yeon.
Is everyone all right?
-Yeah. -What about Yang Gi-su?
We might lose him if we move together. You take the kids.
Understood.
Let's go.
Be careful, mister.
Hurry up and go.
What's this?
So-yeon.
Stop!
He's a monster.
You lowlife scum.
Die!
Die! All of you!
Die!
You all deserve to die! I should kill every single one of you.
Useless scum. Evolutionary rejects.
Ready or not, here I come!
So-yeon.
So-yeon.
It's okay, So-yeon.
It's okay. Daddy will bring you back.
It's okay. You're going to be okay. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Yang Gi-su!
Don't come any closer!
Not another step.
I'm going to save my baby girl.
Don't come any closer!
That's enough, you monster!
You were wrong.
You couldn't save anyone.
Not even your daughter.
You people ruined everything.
You people ruined it all.
I wasn't wrong.
You people ruined everything.
You people…
You people ruined--
What will you do now?
I'll start again right here.
It's raining!
It's raining!
It's raining!
It's really raining.
How long has it been?
It's been so long since we had rain.
Let's go home now.
Right, let's go.
God, that's refreshing!
Line up properly, everyone!
-Step forward. Let's go. -Su-na.
Su-na, white pigs like these are really delicious, you know.
That's…
Good luck with her, mister.
What do you mean, "good luck"?
-This way, Stepmom! -What do you mean, "Stepmom"?
Well, I don't drink.
What's that ribbon she's wearing?
-Move. -Where are you going?
I didn't survive to put up with this.
He's been everywhere in the world you all wanna go...
and a bunch of places you don't.
I've asked him to come and talk to you all today
at this important crossroad in your careers.
I'm gonna step out so this conversation can be frank and to the point.
About five years ago, when I was on leave...
...I found myself standing in the middle of the cereal aisle at the Publix...
with my arm around some guy's throat.
I was squeezing so hard he pissed himself.
My fiancée at the time had to climb on my back
just so I didn't actually kill the guy.
Do you know why I was doing this?
Because he hadn't moved his cart when I asked.
I was the best of the best,
able to shut down, control, manipulate...
all basic human instincts towards one goal:
the completion of my mission.
But the effects of committing extreme violence on other human beings
are biological
and physiological.
That's the price of being a warrior.
[pilot on radio, in Spanish] Is everything clear in the valley?
Affirmative!
[pilot] Copy that.
Enter, enter, enter!
[pilot] Let's go!
♪ Make his fight on the hill In the early day ♪
[officer 2 over radio] Enter, enter, enter.
[officer 3 over megaphone] Let me inform you
that we have you surrounded.
So, put down your weapons,
come out of the building
with your hands behind your head.
How many did you say were in there?
No more than ten.
You guys hold this position.
We're going to find other cover.
But hold here.
Good.
Rodriguez!
Rodriguez, can you hold your position?
[captain over radio] Rodriguez!
Fuck no!
We need to get back.
I said, maintain your positions.
-Hold on! -[officer 4] Move him! Move him!
Rodriguez?
Rodriguez?
[captain over radio] Rodriguez!
[officer 4] Diego!
Hold on!
Advance.
[officer 4] Nice shot.
[Diego] I'm so tired of arresting all of you
only to simply find you all here again.
Oh, my adviser is here.
Ready, brother?
America is listening.
Take the money, brother.
It's $400,000.
You lose nothing.
I already have the money. [sighs]
And... and Lorea?
[Diego] What was it that you said?
Now you're turning on your own boss?
[stammers] I know where he is.
Fucking snitch. Shh!
[Diego] Where's that?
In Mexico? Disneyland?
Where?
No, no.
He's hiding in the jungle, my brother.
He went there because he doesn't trust banks or any of those things anymore. [panting]
Sir, you could find him.
You just got yourself killed, fucker.
Silence!
Lift up, lift up your little face.
Is this guy telling me the truth?
Does anyone else out here want to try to assault a police officer?
Or tell fairy tales about Mr. Lorea?
Take them to the trucks.
-[officers shouting] -I'll go after her.
Get up there with the bikes, now!
Move! Move!
[Diego over radio] Santiago? Santiago?
[Diego] Santiago, where are you?
Yes, Diego?
I don't know where I am.
But she escaped. I lost her.
-[speaking Spanish] -[driver speaking Spanish]
-[in English] What were you doing there? -[woman] Warning my brother.
Jesus.
[woman] You said it was going down at noon, -and it's ten fucking thirty. -It wasn't my bust.
-and it's ten fucking thirty. -It wasn't my bust. It was never my bust. [in Spanish] He changed it.
It was never my bust. [in Spanish] He changed it.
-They took him? -I don't know.
They took my brother, and you have to get him out.
-Get him out? -Yes.
You're lucky he's still alive.
But he won't be alive for very long.
[Santiago] You never should've let your idiot brother get involved with this shit.
[in English] What if I told you I know?
I know where Lorea is.
I know where the money is.
How long have you known?
Three months.
And why wouldn't you tell me that?
Because I'm just your informant, right?
That's all I am?
If you've got something to tell me, right now is the time to do it.
[informant] I...
was given a promotion.
I deliver vans full of money...
to Lorea's house in the jungle.
That's where he keeps the money.
[in Spanish] His house is a safe.
[in English] And just so you know,
Lorea pays Diego and all of those men that hired you way too much money.
They've just been watching you chase your tail.
But now, maybe, you can actually do something.
Your government has put a lot of time, money, and training into all of you,
and it does not want to lose that investment.
Over the next few weeks,
you will be bombarded with offers to take your skill set and use them
in the private sector.
I was suckered into the same thing.
That's what I'm here to say,
that I have never had a feeling as pure or proud
as completing a mission with our flag on my shoulder.
Stay where you belong.
Thank you.
-[door opens] -[William] Good luck.
How many times have you given that speech?
It'll be 173.
[Santiago laughs] Still keeping count of everything in your life?
Of course.
-[Santiago] It's still a good speech. -Thank you.
How you been?
I'm okay. You?
Did you get my text?
Yeah.
[Santiago] So? What's your take?
Who else do you have?
I came to you first.
If you can get Redfly,
I'll do it.
Really?
Yeah.
[Santiago] Do you think he's up for it?
I just feel like we owe him. Besides...
it's always a little harder than you think it's gonna be, right?
Get the captain, I'm in.
So... this is three bedroom... and one and a half baths.
Nice view out the back window here.
Gets good light.
Kitchen's right this way.
They're asking $120,000.
-I think there's some flexibility there. -Yeah.
I don't think this is the one for us. Thank you, though.
All right, thank you.
[Santiago] Hey, I'm lookin' for a condo.
I hear you're the guy to talk to.
-Sorry to track you down like this. -Hey, man.
I called your office.
-[Redfly] It's good to see you. -[Santiago] Good to see you.
-You look great. -Ah, yeah, right.
-No, you do. -It's been a while, huh?
Well, we didn't hear from you for a couple of years.
We thought you might have gone full native in the jungle.
[Santiago] Yeah, I know.
Sorry.
-So, how are you? -[Redfly sighs]
Uh... I'm okay.
[Santiago] Yeah, I heard about you and Molly.
Yeah. It happens.
So, I got a job for you.
Guaranteed 17 grand for a week of consulting.
No action unless you want it. It's just a recce.
I'm retired.
I know. [chuckles]
What is it?
We're gonna get Gabriel Martin Lorea.
[Redfly] Haven't you been trying to do that for years?
Yes. I could never find him, and I finally did.
I can't do it, man.
There's more of this shit around now than ever.
Anthony was down here trying to get me to go to Africa for a month, -but I-- I can't-- I can't do it. -[Santiago] I need you on this one.
-but I-- I can't-- I can't do it. -[Santiago] I need you on this one.
-It's less than a week of work. -I would love to.
God knows I could use the money, but I'm supporting two households right now.
There's potential for significant upside on this.
Will you just take a look at my work on it?
-Are you going to Benny's fight? -[Santiago] Yeah.
I gotta pick up Tess. I'm late. Molly's gonna kill me.
-Just ride with me, okay? -[Santiago] All right.
[Santiago] Molly's still letting you over here, even after the split?
Only in the garage.
[Santiago] I'm sorry.
[sighs] Tess!
-Still drink? -[Santiago] Oh, yeah.
Want a beer?
[Tom] Ah, shit.
[sighs] You sleeping with this woman?
The accountant, the bean counter who gave you all the information.
I'm guessing she's hot.
-[can opens] -What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, well, I just noticed, over the years, your informants tend to be very attractive women.
your informants tend to be very attractive women.
No, I'm not.
[clicks tongue, sighs] Why not?
[Santiago] It's a fucked-up enough situation as it is.
[Tom] Hey, babe.
[Santiago] Hey, Tess!
[sighs] Santiago.
Wow, so grown up, man.
-[Tom] Oh, I don't know about that. -[Santiago chuckles]
I made 17 grand my first year in the service, man.
If you told me then I'd be passing that up for a week's work...
Don't worry about her, she's 15. She's not listening to a word we say.
[Santiago] Seventeen grand is just for the recce.
But if we decide to move forward, this could be a whole lot more than that.
I've cut a deal with the agency down there.
We keep 25% of anything we seize.
I've got estimates he's got over $75 million in cash with him.
-[Tom] Holy shit. -Yeah.
Let's say the money is there. How do we get paid?
'Cause this shit is serious, and it takes real planning.
And you know that. [Santiago] I've got a lawyer in St. John's
who set up an offshore shell security operation
that's ready to pay out a salary and bonuses for the rest of our lives.
It'll just come in like any other paycheck.
Will you take a look at my work on it?
No, I don't want to see that because then I can't unsee it.
This operation is... illegal, right?
This is not illegal.
My company's under contract to an agency of a foreign government.
And besides, even if it was illegal, most of the live fire you've done's been
against the Geneva Convention, technically, so...
[Tom] Come on, you're a better salesman than that. This is a very different thing.
I'll be right back.
[Tess] So you're trying to get him to go back to work?
Maybe. Why?
No reason.
You think your mom would still let him go?
[Tess] My mom? [chuckles] Of course.
-She's not the problem. [sighs] -[door chimes jingle]
[Tess] He hasn't worked since they forced him to retire.
Your dad's a good man.
You shouldn't be too hard on him.
So, I guess you'll just keep selling condos,
and I'll run and gun until my knees finally blow out.
Or you could do this without me.
I could. But I don't wanna,
'cause I say we deserve better, man.
How many times did we fly around with 20 million bucks at our feet
to pay off some cockroach somewhere, and we never took a dime?
-Hell, you've been shot four times. -Five.
You've been shot five times for your country,
and you can't even afford a new truck.
That's the real crime.
-Good to see you, Tess. -[Tess] Good to see you.
-You coming back? -Yeah, I'll be back in 20.
-You coming back? -Yeah, I'll be back in 20. I gotta drop her off. Is Ironhead in?
I gotta drop her off. Is Ironhead in?
Only if you are.
-Just take a look. -Fine.
I'll take a look. Leave my truck outta this.
This isn't about my truck.
Yes, it is. That's exactly what this is about!
-Your mom will pick you up, okay? -Yep.
[Tom] Hey!
I love you.
I miss you.
-[William] What'd he say? -He's taking a look at it.
He may not be up for this.
[William] You know he's the best with something this complex.
And he needs this right now.
[Santiago] All right.
[scoffs] This shit is fuckin' depressing.
C'mon.
Let your brother have some fun. Support him.
[William] I've been supporting him since the day he was born.
-[door opens] -That kid's a one-in-a-million talent,
going out there, playing the fucking clown to a bunch of hillbillies.
-[banging] -[Benny] Ah, yeah, where are my corner men?
Holy shit, look who it is!
[Santiago] What's up, Benny? Oh, holy shit!
[groans] Oh, God!
Hell of a night for you to show.
-It's great to see you, man. -You as well.
[in Spanish] Hey! Every day you're uglier.
[Santiago chuckles] Ah, you little shithead.
Good to see you.
[Santiago, in English] Did you boys get my text?
-Yeah? -[man chuckles]
Fish?
I need a pilot. I can't do this thing without you.
I don't know, man. I got the new baby now,
and my lady isn't into me doing this kinda shit anymore.
What-- What does that mean?
Did you read the text? This can change you and that baby's life forever.
What happened to that bullshit about going back to your mother's homeland
and empowering the people to police themselves?
Anyway, I lost my license. I can't even fly right now.
Well, I don't need a pilot with a license.
I'm in with the army down there. I just need a pilot I can trust.
Yeah, I don't think so.
[Santiago sighs, chuckles] Okay. Lorea is destroying that country.
So we get to take out a very bad man, and, oh, by the way,
there's a winning lottery ticket stuck to the bottom of your cowboy boot.
Every guy in that gym would jump at this.
Come on, focus, guys! It's fight night.
Yeah, don't worry about that bullshit.
Sorry, Benny.
You ready for this?
-Hell yeah. -[bell dings]
[William] Let's go.
-I didn't mean to call your shit bullshit. -[chuckles] It's all right.
I got busted.
It's not a big deal.
Actually, it's a big deal.
Coke?
[scoffs] Jesus, Frankie.
Technically, it's a suspension. I'm still under review.
Well, what about you? What are you gonna do?
I said if Redfly's in, I'm in.
-Come on, stick with me here, guys. -Oh, I'm with you, Benny.
But are you with me?
Are you in?
You know I am.
-[pats back] -I go where you go.
That's what I thought. Benny stands tall.
[announcer over PA] From Red Feather Lakes, Colorado,
standing six foot three, weighing in at 195 pounds,
I bring you... Ben Miller!
-Come on! [shouts] -[crowd cheering]
Let's go, Benny!
Cheers, man.
Benny, take it easy! Nice and slow!
I took a look at your folder. It's good work.
Thank you.
You need five guys and a pilot.
Go! Get him, Benny!
[William] What's up, brother?
The only thing missing is your entry plan.
I have a full set of bullshit passports waiting for us.
We go through immigration as power line consultants.
Once we're in-country,
they don't have any facial recognition cameras yet, so...
we're ghosts.
So what's the verdict?
I'm in for the recce if you guys are.
-[Santiago] You sure? -Yeah, just the recce though.
-[Santiago] You sure? -Yeah, just the recce though. No live fire.
-That's all right. -Okay.
[Santiago] Fish?
When is it?
We leave Thursday.
[sighs] Okay.
[announcer] And here we go!
[Tom] Come on, Benny! Let's go!
-All right, it's time to work. -[bell dings]
Comms.
Pass those out.
We're in Lorea's backyard.
So what's this guy got against banks? At least a safe.
[Santiago over radio] The house is the safe.
[Benny] I'm at the gate.
This looks like everything was done about 82% right.
They got all the toys out here, but these cameras aren't even aimed
at the weakest breach point.
[Tom] Your girlfriend's making her normal money drop?
[Santiago] Yeah.
She's prepared to record the inside of the house.
[Frankie] Pope...
Pope, I have kids over here. Does he have kids living in here with him?
'Cause that's gonna make things a whole lot more complicated
and is not what I signed up for.
The family's not the problem. They're the answer.
[Frankie] Why?
[Santiago] Church.
Lorea's very devout.
Every Sunday morning,
he sends three guards to the 6:00 a.m. service.
When they get back, he sends the rest of the team,
along with his family, into town to mass.
That leaves him
and three guards in that house, and that's our window.
Why would he do that?
[Santiago] Worried about someone taking his kids.
And he never leaves his money.
Also, I don't think he believes anyone actually has the balls
to come out here and rob him.
It's probably 'cause it's a stupid idea.
[Benny] Pope, I got your girlfriend coming up right now.
Holy shit.
She is beautiful, man.
I fucking knew it.
Fuck off.
[William whispers] God damn.
I got an execution about to go down over here.
Are you at the tennis courts?
[William] Yeah.
Yeah, that's his spot.
[Frankie] Why is she doing this?
[Santiago] She hopes I can get her little brother out of jail.
[Benny] Did you put him in jail?
-[Santiago] Not really. -Buenas.
[Tom] I'm guessing that's putting her at some risk.
[Frankie] Man, I almost forgot why I got out of this business.
Shit gets so dark so quick.
Oh, shit, we got ground sensors here, boys.
[Santiago] Did you hit one?
I don't know, I'm not sure.
Benny, I got two guys on motorbikes coming your way.
[William] Hold tight, Benny. I'm trying to get out there to cover you.
[informant, in Spanish] Good afternoon, Mr. Lorea.
[in English] A stock boy job at Walmart's starting to look pretty good right now, boys.
[in Spanish] It looks good to me.
Good.
Thank you, sir.
[in English] I'm clear. They're coming back to you.
[sighs] Let's get the fuck outta here.
[Frankie] You were gonna piss yourself.
I was getting onto the déjà vu part, man.
[William] So what's the plan?
Are their guys prepared to operate across the border?
What's the scope of this thing?
Sunday soft hit is the way to do it.
Otherwise, you bring in an army, you'd start a fucking war up there.
Mm-hmm. So, when do you need to present to the agency down here?
[clicks tongue] I'm not sure I wanna tell them.
Why?
[Santiago] We saw the place.
It's full of holes.
So maybe we don't tell them...
-[Benny chuckles] -...and we do this thing ourselves.
What?
-[Santiago] What? -[Benny sighs]
Now, we each took 17 grand...
to help the narcotics unit map out and plan this fuckin' thing.
I told you I wasn't even comfortable helping them do it.
Now you want us to do it by ourselves? Kill a bunch of fuckin' narcos?
If we hit that window, like you said, when they're at church,
nobody but Lorea gets killed.
[Santiago] And I'm okay with that.
[Tom] Does the agency down here even know about this?
-What do you mean? -Come on, man!
-What do you mean? -Come on, man! Don't fuck around.
Who paid our fees?
It's complicated, technically...
you guys were paid through an LLC.
Mm, no, not that complicated. It's $100,000. Where the fuck did it come from?
[Santiago] I'll get the bill.
Thanks.
Great trip, boys. [sighs] It's turning out to be some full-on cowboy shit.
Whose money is it, huh?
-It was my money. -Jeez.
[Frankie, in Spanish] What were you thinking?
[in English] What? Does that change anything?
Yeah, man.
You fucking lied to us.
No, I didn't lie to you.
[softly] I asked you guys to come down here,
do reconnaissance, and make a plan.
Now, we can execute that plan alone
and take all of the money,
or you guys can fuck off, and I'll bring the team from down here in.
But I assure you, if I do that, this fucker will find out about it,
and he'll be gone, and I need this guy.
You know how many fucking bad men are out there all over the world?
Yeah, well, this is my last one.
-[both chuckle] -[Santiago] And you may not believe it,
but I have been here for the last three years of my life,
trying to make a difference, but it's a fucking mess.
And it's all because of Lorea.
The thought of leaving everything we've done behind for the last 17 years,
with nothing to show for it--
-Fuck you, nothing to show for it. -[scoffs]
Look, if...
If we had accomplished half the things that we've accomplished
in any other profession, we'd be set for life.
Hey, man, that's the deal we cut.
-Well, it's a shitty deal. -Yeah, well...
Because this man's a goddamn hero,
and he can't even send his kids to college.
And Fish's the most talented pilot I know, and he's grounded on a bullshit coke rap.
And how many times can your brother get the shit knocked out of him for--
I didn't get the shit beat out of me. I won that fight.
Sorry, Benny.
And how many more pep talks can you possibly give?
I'm done, man.
Both knees are shot.
That neck operation I got last year made the whole thing worse.
So, the question is,
do we finally get to use our skills for our own benefit
and actually change something?
So, are we doing this?
[Tom] How the fuck am I supposed to know?
This guy doesn't come through with the one key piece of intel
we need to make this decision.
For all we know, she could be setting us up to get her brother back.
she could be setting us up to get her brother back. We'll know tomorrow.
She should have been recording that whole thing today.
All right, if it does come back clean,
how would you do the Sunday morning version?
-I haven't thought about it. -Bullshit, you can't help yourself.
All right.
In the first pop, you'd have 40 minutes to get in, get the job done,
and get out before the family comes home from church.
That's a hard out.
We need to breach the fence,
sweep the premises, find and subdue the guards,
scrub the hard drives in the security room,
get rid of Lorea, find the money, pack the money into 18 hundred-pound bags,
and then hoof it half a mile to the nearest vehicle.
There's only two ways out:
the fence in the front, or over the mountain we came down, and I'm too old for that.
We need to use one of their vans.
[Frankie] There were two vans in the courtyard.
But if the family uses those vans to go to church, then we got nothing.
So we need another van.
-Can your girl work that out? -I can ask her.
Still got your aviation guy down here?
'Cause we would need a heavy-lift helicopter in 32 hours
to get us over the Andes and to the ocean.
I don't know, but I'll give him a call.
[Benny] Oh, yeah! Big dog is back!
Redfly's gonna be rich, boys!
Now we're talkin'.
[in Spanish] Hello.
-Thank you. Have a good day. -[vendor speaking Spanish]
-[Santiago, in English] Thank you. -That's it?
[Santiago] I don't know.
[in Spanish] Miss, two coffees, please.
-[in English] My brother. -[Santiago] Yeah.
I might need you to do one more thing for me.
Can you get an extra van...
into the compound, Sunday morning?
If I did that, they're going to know it's me.
And everyone who works for him ends up dead, sooner or later.
If you can get me an extra van in there Sunday morning...
I will get you and your brother out of the country
with new papers and money.
How much?
Two million.
Two million?
[Santiago] Yes.
And you'll only have a couple hours to get my brother?
I'll find a way.
But I need that van inside those gates.
[sighs] Okay.
-Yeah? -[informant] Yes. I'll get the van.
But if we're not gone forever after you make your move, we are dead.
You'll be gone.
Yeah.
Thank you.
[Santiago] Hey, fellas.
Take a look at this.
[chuckles] Jesus, Pope!
-What the hell were you planning here? -Exactly this.
Every single gun, bullet, and fucking toothpick here's been sourced in-country.
The idea is to pin this on a local rival gang.
Now, who was it that didn't trust this lady?
'Cause not only is she going to get us that extra van, but she got us this.
There's our man, Lorea.
And, oh!
Look at what's there behind him.
-[Lorea speaking on recording] -Looks like money to me.
-There's gotta be about 35 million there. -We don't know that.
Whatever it is, it's a lot.
What are you gonna do with your share, huh?
Never spend your money until it's in your pocket, Benjamin.
[Benny] Well, I'm just sayin', I'm gonna get that Ferrari, man.
-[Frankie] How original. -What about the bird?
Well, he said if we're there with three million bucks, he'll be there.
So we got a bird, we got a van,
we got Lorea confirmed in the house with the money.
All right, give me-- give me a minute.
Uh, you know, if you had pulled this shit when we were active duty,
I would have court-martialed your ass.
Look, why don't we all just have a dinner tonight,
get drunk, on me, and you all can go home in the morning?
Nah, fuck that.
[sighs] I can't.
Somehow, I just...
...ended up against it here. You know?
I'm burning through my pension. Molly's job doesn't cut it.
I can't sell condos to save my fucking life.
The only thing I have is taking care of these girls.
[Santiago] Yeah.
Yeah, I understand that.
Fuck, I missed this.
It's like they take your best 20 years, and then spit you out.
Yeah.
[Tom] I just can't stop thinking about the mistakes.
-[Santiago] What mistakes? -[sighs] Fuck, man.
All of 'em.
-Didn't get better when you got out? -[Tom] No.
Only thing that made it feel better is when you put a gun in my hand.
[clicks tongue] So, I guess that's what we'll do.
[Tom] All right, first things first:
safety.
There is no medevac. There is no ground support.
Any injuries we sustain, we're walking out with.
Be mindful, each of you has a medical kit in your bag.
Number two:
you cannot go back to your normal life after tonight.
Make no mistake about it. What we are about to do is criminal.
We do not have the flag on our shoulders, and no amount of bullshit
We do not have the flag on our shoulders, and no amount of bullshit that we tell ourselves is gonna change that.
If we do our job right,
we will be committing one murder and one armed robbery.
You guys need to own the fact that you are desecrating
most of the oaths you ever took.
-[Frankie sighs] -[Tom] Third:
family.
If they don't go to church, or if they come home early, it's an abort. Full stop. They are not who we came for.
it's an abort. Full stop. They are not who we came for.
And lastly,
it's not too late to go home.
We had an agreement with Pope,
and we fulfilled that.
Any man here who wants to walk away now can do so knowing they're the best of us.
But it's gotta be now.
I wanna make sure we're not leaving that house
without taking care of Lorea.
If he's there like he's supposed to be, we'll get him.
We leave at 0300.
[Benny over radio] It's a good thing these guys are so devout.
Our dad used to say,
"When it's raining, it means God didn't need us in church today."
He also said you go to heaven for the climate and hell for the company.
[Benny] Actually, I think Mark Twain said that.
All right, keep the radio clear, let's stay awake here.
[Tom] How many is that getting in? Count it.
Seven getting in the van.
[Santiago] Anybody see Lorea?
Negative. We never saw him come out.
The wife and two kids are in with a single driver.
The family's left the building.
Repeat, family are all clear.
All right, let's get ready here.
Damn, Pope, this lady is a keeper.
Punctual, smart, and brave as shit.
-[in Spanish] Good day. -What's this?
I'm here to drop off this van, and then my brother is taking me home.
That idiot didn't tell me.
[Benny, in English] She's in. She's in.
[Tom] Here we go. Ben, you're first hit. Call when it's secure.
With this rain, the guards are gonna be inside.
[Benny] Roger.
-[Benny] All clear, she's gone. -[Tom] Copy.
[William] All right, we're going in.
[Benny] Front gate secure.
One guard secured in the kitchen.
-[Tom] Ben, come to the house. -[Benny] Roger.
[Benny] I'm at the front door.
Hold, Benny. Hold.
Threat in the TV room.
We're gonna go around the side.
[Benny] What's going on in there?
[Santiago] All clear, Benny. Eyes out for Lorea.
He sure as fuck heard us now.
[Benny] I'm coming in.
[Santiago] Setting charges to the security room.
[Tom] What was that?
[Benny] We had to shoot the second guard in the leg. -They're taking him to the kitchen. -[Tom] Coming down.
-They're taking him to the kitchen. -[Tom] Coming down.
[Benny] Come on.
[Santiago] Fuse is burning.
[Santiago] Any trace of him?
She said he never leaves.
[quietly] We got nothing. This guy's a ghost.
[Tom] Everyone to the office, right now.
[Benny, shouting] What the fuck?
And Lorea?
Nothing. A couple of bags.
-[bags thud] -[William] He's gone.
With the money.
[Frankie sighs] Your girl gave us up, Pope.
We gotta get the fuck outta here.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
What's that smell like to you?
-Like a serious fuck-up. -[chuckles]
No.
Paint.
The house is the safe.
The house is the fucking safe.
[William] Benny, help me move this. Come on.
-[Benny] I'll take the edge. -[Tom] Over there.
Go, come on. Come on, man. Come on!
-[Benny] Holy shit! -[Frankie] Come on.
-[Tom grunts] -[William] Go. Move, move.
-[Tom] Oh, my God! -[Santiago] Fish, I'm up.
[Santiago] Come on, guys!
-[laughs] -[Santiago] Holy shit!
What'd I tell you, boys?
-Jesus Christ! -[Benny continues laughing]
[Santiago] Fucking God! Look at it!
-It goes all the way up! -[William] Let's go!
We're gonna need some bags.
-[Benny] I'll get another bag! -[William] Keep it coming.
What's wrong?
If the money's still here, it means he's still here.
He's gone, man.
We got more!
[William] Back wall, too.
[Tom] Just concentrate.
Oh, we're just gettin' rich!
[Santiago] How much time we got?
-[panting] -[Benny and William] Eight minutes.
Millers, enough of that over there.
We gotta start getting this shit to the van.
Yeah, we got this.
-Come on, bro. -[Tom] Keep your eyes open.
[Benny] Here, take these. I'm gonna go get the van.
-Meet me there. -[William] Yes, sir. [Frankie] Careful.
-[keys jangle] -Classic.
Jesus Christ.
-[laughing] Help us, man! -Come on! Come on!
Come on. Over there.
-[Santiago grunts] -Holy shit! [laughs]
[William] We're gonna need more bags. See if you can find something.
On it.
I tell you one thing, man, you can tell your girls they can stop studying
'cause Daddy's just gonna buy their way into Harvard!
[laughing] Holy shit, this is a fuckload of money!
Grab some of those and go.
How are we on time?
We got time for a couple more loads.
-You sure? -Grab those and bring 'em down.
[Frankie] Guys!
I got another wall over here!
-[sighs] Holy shit! -Shit!
It's everywhere.
[sighs] Well, fuck me!
It's the whole fucking house.
[William] What's up?
The van's full, man!
It's all good. We gotta go.
What the hell are you doing?
Stop digging more out. We got all this to deal with.
A couple more loads.
You know, in the ten years I've been working with you, Tom,
You know, in the ten years I've been working with you, Tom, you have never missed a hard out!
I gave us a 15-minute cushion.
It's 12 minutes to the church, a 40-minute service, 12 minutes back.
Add 5 minutes to load in and out of the van,
and we can subtract 7 to beat them to the exit route. We will be fine!
All right? God damn it, look at all this money!
Just a couple more loads!
Fuck this!
Time's up. We gotta go.
I want one more sweep for Lorea.
All right?
And then we burn it all down.
[Frankie] Okay,
I'll get these last one loaded down there,
and you call out when you're ready to light it up.
[sighs] Move. Move!
[William] Come on, we gotta go!
-Lighting it up. -[lighter clicks]
What are we shooting at in here?
Is that Lorea?
He's dead.
Good.
[panting] I'm hit.
Shit!
-Take it easy. -[Santiago] Where?
[grunts] Left side.
Did it go through?
[Tom] Yeah, it went through.
-[William] I'll be fine. -[Tom] It'll be okay.
-[William] Get the clot kit. -[Tom] Straight through.
You'll be okay.
You'll be all right.
Just breathe.
I'm okay.
All right. Let go.
-Told you this was a stupid idea. -Yeah, you sure did.
Sunday school's over, boys.
They're back.
Oh, shit!
-The family? -No, the first shift of guards.
-You okay? -[William] I'm all right.
You gonna be able to move?
-We don't got a stretcher. -Yeah.
Just help me get my kit back on.
All right, we can each take a backpack of cash,
we go out through the back into the jungle, and we're gone.
-I'll cover the cost of the operation. -Fuck that.
No.We are bringing Ironhead home safe.
Not dragging him through the jungle.
And we're not leaving them any of this fucking money.
Right, so we burn it all down and go.
There's about $100 million for them waiting in the van out there.
We need to hunt and shoot quickly.
Call out your kills. I don't want any fuckin' surprises.
-Got it? -All right.
-Let's do this. -[grunts]
[Tom] You two go that way, we'll come down the front.
I'm all right.
Let's just do it.
All right.
[Santiago] Let's go.
[Tom over radio] Here we go, fellas.
[William] That's two down in the front hall.
[Frankie] That's three.
[Santiago] That's four.
[Tom] Get back to the gate. I'm sure they dropped a few guys out there.
On the way.
[Frankie] Anybody got eyes on that SUV the guards came in?
Because we're gonna need it.
[Benny] I'm already loading it up.
[Tom] Is everybody out of there?
-[Benny] Coast's clear. -[Santiago] All clear.
[Benny] Another van of guys just passed me in the driveway.
[Santiago] Catfish is coming around with the van.
What are you doing? Come on! Let's go!
[Frankie] Benny! Hey!
[Santiago] Let's go, man! Hustle!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck!
-[Tom] What? -What do you mean, what?
That was a shit job back there, man. We don't leave messes like that!
[Frankie] What do we do up here? I've got the family waiting to go in.
[Tom] Take it slow.
-[Santiago grunts] -[Frankie] Your girlfriend's here.
-[in Spanish] Did you get out okay? -[informant] Yes.
We're almost there. Help me.
[in English] Just load 'em up, and I'll weigh 'em.
-[Frankie] Where's your guy? -He'll be here.
What the fuck we gonna do with that thing?
William.
-Habibi. -[pilot laughs] Kaifa halak?
-You made it. -[pilot] Count on me.
Mosquito bite?
[William] Yeah, a little one.
-Feels worse than it looks. -[pilot laughs]
Now how the hell are we all gonna fit in that?
-[pilot] Come when you're ready. -[man over radio] Copy.
-[helicopter blades whirring] -[William] Feel free to count it.
I know where to find you.
Voilà!
[shouts] It won't all fit in the net!
We gotta get the rest on it inside!
I don't know if that scale's fucked up, but he's telling me we got 6,000 pounds here.
That's $250 million.
We stole 250 million?
I'm definitely getting that Ferrari!
-Are you sure? -Let's go!
If that scale is even close to being right, we're gonna have a weight issue.
What's the issue? This helo can carry 9,000 pounds.
That's 9,000 at 2,000 feet.
If we want to get to the ocean, we gotta fly over the fucking Andes, man.
Are we really leaving $200 million on the fucking runway?
Okay, she'll make it. Let's go!
What's your plan for her? We're already overweight as it is.
We promised them a ride over the border into Peru.
And we're gonna stand by that!
Okay, we're gonna let you go now.
Thank you.
[Tom] I just need to know something.
What's my name?
I-- I don't know.
What about your buddy back there? What's his name?
I don't know.
He said he couldn't tell me.
Okay, I want you to be real careful... about what you're about to say
because the only thing that ties us to them is you.
Now, when you finally had sex,
and you rolled over and looked him in the eye and said,
"What's your real name?" What did he say?
That never happened.
I can just go ask him.
He never told me where he was from.
He said that you served together...
and that you were honest.
Why'd he say that?
Because I asked him if...
if he wasn't afraid of you cheating him.
That's why.
Everything all right?
No!
[in Spanish] Here's three million dollars.
And two tickets with visas to Sydney, Australia.
On the way to the airport, stop at this shipping company.
Make sure to send the boxes to this hotel in Sydney.
You know that's a lot more than 75 million dollars in there.
[in English] What does that mean?
It's not just Lorea's money in there.
A lot more people are gonna come looking after you.
I can deal with that. But do not stay in South America
because they will find you and they will kill you.
[in Spanish] Promise me that you won't stay here.
-Yes! -Promise me!
I promise you.
[in English] How... How do I contact you?
You can't.
You did everything right.
You deserve this.
[in Spanish] Take care of yourselves.
Go!
She's lying.
No, she's not.
There are consequences to this shit.
You know what we should have done?
That's one you wouldn't come back from.
[Frankie] The weight drags at higher altitudes. I'd like to stay under 5,000 feet till we hit the Andes.
Ocean in four hours.
Roger that. Nice work.
[Frankie] I'm gonna try between these two bigger peaks.
Find this valley I saw on the map.
[Tom] Roger.
[Frankie] Just one last push through the Andes.
[Tom] How high do you think that is?
[Frankie] It's gotta be 11,000. Can't fly that high.
[Tom] Shouldn't have to. Head for that lower ridge.
How are we doing up here, boys?
Can we make it over?
I don't know.
What the fuck is going on up here?
Go for it.
All right, baby. All right, baby.
Come on, now.
-We're redlining, man. -It's close, though.
It's too much weight. It's too much fucking weight.
We're never gonna make it.
-What does that mean? -It means we're losing fucking money.
You wanna leave $50 million in the middle of the jungle?
Do you wanna get to the ocean?
All right, go do it.
I got it!
[Santiago grunts] All right, let me check.
-[alarm beeping] -How's she feeling now?
[Frankie] That's feeling better.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
What the fuck are you doing, Catfish?
One of the gearboxes is blown.
What?
I don't want to go into a spin.
[grunts] Okay, we might be in trouble here.
[Frankie] I'm losing altitude.
[grunts] Ah, we should land. We should land now.
Crash-land here, and we all die.
I'm trying to get her back to flat.
Roger. Prepare for a hard landing!
[Tom] There should be a farmer's field on the other side of that ridge.
-We passed it on the way up. -[Frankie] I remember it.
[Frankie] I can't land this with that bag under us.
We should lose the money, maybe we don't die.
Lose the money, or we're all gonna die!
Hit the external load release. It's on the wall!
Pull the lever, Ben!
It didn't work!
[Frankie] There should be a manual override
on the cargo hook.
Let me through!
-[William] Benny! -[screams]
All right, I'm gonna try to land here.
I gotta jump!
-[yells] -[William] Benny!
Bad landing.
Fish! Fish!
-You all right? -Yeah, I think so. I think so.
Yo, Benny!
-Benny! -[Santiago grunts]
-[Benny] I'm here! -[Santiago] Come on, we gotta move.
-Come on! -[Frankie groans]
[William grunts] Let's get our shit outta here.
[Santiago] Try and get up to it.
-[Benny] Fish! -I need oxygen. [grunts]
-[clamoring in distance] -[Tom] Everybody okay?
[Santiago and William] Yeah.
-[Tom] They're into the fucking net. -What's the plan here?
[Tom] We're gonna get that money over that mountain to the ocean.
Benny, cover us from under that tree line there.
-Fish, you take position up there. -[William grunts]
That's cocaine they're growing, so they may have weapons trained on us
That's cocaine they're growing, so they may have weapons trained on us from those buildings right there.
We got working radios?
-No, comms are dead. -[Tom] Go with hand signals.
Pope and I will get out there and look as peaceful as we can.
We'll give you a hand signal when we think it's secure.
-Let's move. -[William] Benny.
[in Spanish] Please step back. Sirs!
Step back, please, that is not yours.
Who are you?
Who are you with?
We're with the army.
We are advisers.
You should call a rescue helicopter.
-It's coming. -Yes.
In the meantime, you are alone and don't have any uniforms.
Okay, that can be resolved.
But what about the other passengers from the accident?
We can talk about that.
But tell your people to stop stealing our property.
These are our lands.
You fucked up, DEA.
No, no, no. Calm down. Calm down.
Sir, careful with that weapon.
-We're not DEA. We're not DEA. -[man] We are calm.
-We're not DEA. We're not DEA. -[man] We are calm. -[man] Tell your guy to put his gun down. -[Santiago] Stay calm. Stop.
-[man] Tell your guy to put his gun down. -[Santiago] Stay calm. Stop.
[in English] Pope, what's he reaching for? A weapon?
Pope, do you cop--
[in Spanish] Stay right there. Don't get any closer.
[in English] Fuck! What the hell, man?
-[in Spanish] Assholes! Murderers! -[Santiago] Get out of there!
-[in English] Fuck! -[woman shouts in Spanish] No! [sobs]
We need horses or mules, please, and then we will get out of here.
[in English] Benny, get these people back up toward the village.
Fish, get this money on some mules. Let's get the fuck out of here.
[Frankie, in Spanish] Get back!
Get up!
-[Santiago] Get up! Get up, lady! -[shouts]
[farmer] Send me to God.
[Santiago, in English] Go! Keep going!
[sighs] Fuck.
All right, let's get these donkeys saddled up, get the bags on 'em.
Where's Pope?
He's up there.
[Santiago, in Spanish] That is for the mules.
That is for the families.
That is for you.
Are we in agreement?
Good.
We're very sorry for what happened.
And we very much appreciate your cooperation.
[clicks tongue, in English] Come on.
Sorry, kid.
[in Spanish] Those men have paid their debt!
Let them pass.
[William, in English] Did you pay for the damage?
[Tom] Yeah.
[William] How much?
[Tom] Two hundred for the animals. A million for the families.
Which one of you shot first?
I don't know.
We need to watch ourselves here.
Yeah, we do.
What the hell does that mean?
Nothin'.
It just means we gotta watch ourselves, that's all.
Roger that.
How far have we gone?
We've gone about 12 clicks.
To get to the boat, it's another day and a half, maybe two.
Well, a fire would be righteous.
Lorea's guys will be on our tail.
Smoke from a fire will give us away. We cold camp.
Well, we're dancing with the devil now.
[Frankie] Dancing?
We were dancing when we got on the plane to come down here.
I would call this full intercourse. [chuckles]
[Benny] How you doing, bud?
Golden. [sighs]
Here.
[William] You're a good man, Benny.
We're a dyin' breed, boys.
[Benny] No, we're not.
The world's always going to need somebody to go door-to-door to hold the line.
Cops go door-to-door and hold the line.
We were warriors.
Well, it's hard to remember that sometimes.
Yeah, it is.
What are you talking about?
I was too quick on the trigger. You know it, and I know it.
I killed those people.
No, you didn't.
We all did.
[Santiago] This is definitely the old smuggler's trail!
We should just keep following it all the way up.
Come on.
Stop pushing on me, man. It's steep here.
Obviously, man, we're on the side of a fucking mountain!
Just shut up and concentrate! Jesus Christ!
-Come on, just go. -Fuck you.
-[mule brays] -[William] Oh, really?
Keep going!
-[Tom] Stop. -[Benny] You wanna do this?
Oh, fuck!
-[Benny laughs] -What the fuck are you laughing at?
That was a living animal, man.
It could have been any one of us. You're worried about the fucking donkey?
You need to get your shit straight here, man.
-What? Me? -[Santiago] Yeah, you.
[Tom] You're pointing fingers at me?
-You're the reason we're in this mess. -Oh, how the fuck is that?
Yeah, you had to grab every dollar you could get your hands on, didn't you?
You could have gotten Lorea two months ago! We didn't need to be here.
[Santiago] All right.
Fucking bullshit!
We're all on the hook, are we not?
[Tom] God damn this fucking horse! Stop it!
-Yes. It's fine. -Relax. Relax.
We're not picking at the fucking scab right now, okay?
One foot in front of the other.
All right? Come on.
Let's go. Jesus fucking Christ.
Are you sure you want me to get rid of the mules?
[William] This rock side's 20-foot deep. We're not getting the mules through.
Yeah, it's on us now!
[Santiago] Look at the mules.
Well, if we can get over this,
it should be all downhill to the ocean from here.
[Santiago] I got it. I got it. I got it.
[Santiago] All right, come on up!
-Nice work. -You, too.
Look, I talked a lot of shit back there.
I didn't mean that.
-Don't worry about it. -No, no, it's...
This is on me.
-It's... all on me. -No, man, it's...
I'm on the hook for this.
You know? It is what it is. [sniffles]
Yeah, it is what it is.
-I am a bit of a dick, though. -[chuckles]
You could freeze an Eskimo's asshole out here.
I demand a fire.
[sighs] We cold camp.
Fuck you.
This is my "fuck you" money.
Dude, what the fuck are you doing?
[laughing] We don't have enough men to carry this money,
[laughing] We don't have enough men to carry this money, so we might as well be warm. [sniffles]
Oh, Jesus.
-[Frankie] That's more like it. -[Santiago] Este loco...
-Oh! Oh, my God! Holy shit. -[all laugh]
[Tom] Now that's a fire!
-[Tom] Oh, shit! Shit. -[William] Ah, Fuck.
[Benny] I'm hit!
-[William] Benny, you all right? -Yeah, I'm fine. Just grazed my shoulder.
Shooter's up on the ridge line.
Oh, he likes me so much. I'll stay here, hold his fire.
You guys go around the side.
Pope, can you step out?
Work up the trailhead.
All right.
Flank right, make sure no one else is coming up below.
I'll cut up behind you.
Benny, you all right?
[Benny] Yeah, I'm fine. We'll hold down here until you get into position.
I think Pope's in position right now.
Yeah, let's move.
[Benny] Tom!
Tom!
Tom. Come on... Come on.
[sobbing] Come on, Tom. Come on, man.
Come on, man. Come on...
[William] Let me see. Let me see.
[Benny] Oh, my God!
Let's get him wrapped up.
We need to keep moving.
-What the fuck are you talking about? -[sighs]
You're a heartless son of a bitch!
It was your little fire that got him fucking killed!
[quietly] Stop it.
Stop this shit. Stop this shit.
-[Benny shouting] -[Santiago] Fucking stop this!
Stop this shit! Stop it!
-Stop this shit! -[William] Fuck you, Benny! Fuck you!
It wasn't the fire that gave us away.
That kid was from the village.
He's been tracking us for days.
He obviously wanted a clear shot at Tom.
He wanted him.
But we do have to get the fuck out of here,
and we are taking all of that money with us.
Tom's family deserves it!
And so do we.
All right, let's wrap him up. We carry him down.
Rest in peace, brother.
You rest in peace. [sniffles]

[Santiago] How late are we to meet the guy with the boat?
Five days.
Jesus. You think he's still there?
I can't see shit.
We need to get one of us down there.
Think one of you can make it there and back?
I'll go.
Your Spanish sucks, Benny.
I got it.
[Santiago] You sure?
Three?
Yeah.
You're looking for the Hijo Pródigo.
Benny, watch your six.
You watch yours.
I'm gonna say something. Are you listening?
Yeah.
We gotta get back on our game.
Enough of this. It stops now. You understand?
Copy that.
[Frankie] Good.
How many people do you think you've killed?
[Frankie] What?
[William] You heard me.
As many as I had to.
Why would you ever wanna know that?
-Forty-three. -Jesus!
Confirmed.
[Santiago] You keep count of everything, huh?
Yep.
How's your sleep?
I guess better than it should be.
You all right?
[Benny] The boat's there.
I gave him half the money.
I hope he waits.
I didn't go into town,
but it looks like whoever's in charge there...
has a... kindergarten army that's looking for us.
-[William] How many of them? -Two or three pros,
20 heavily-armed teenagers.
What about the next town over?
[Santiago] It's over 100 miles to the south.
I'm sure they've got every town covered anyway.
Must be what's left of Lorea's guys.
So we go through 'em.
Through them?
What, do you mean we mow them all down?
What's the alternative here?
I'm not prepared to wipe out every teenager in that town
I'm not prepared to wipe out every teenager in that town just to get through with this cargo.
[Santiago] This cargo?
What about that cargo?
Will you do it for him?
Tom died for this money, and we're not leaving this country without it!
He didn't die for that money, he died because of it!
[Benny] They're just kids, man.
Can't we carry it out through the dark?
[William] It's over 100 bags. There's no way.
Let me talk to him.
Look, Benny's telling us these are kids, man.
I can't believe... I can't believe I let this happen.
Look, we all came here of our own free will.
Yeah, but...
I thought we could... I thought we could do this.
Yeah.
And we got what we deserved.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me, too.
-But we can't do this. -I know.
I know.
We can't just... go through 'em.
I don't know what I was saying.
It's all right.
We've just gotta get Tom home.
That's all that matters.
How are we gonna do that?
[Santiago] We keep carrying him down.
We fill our days packs with whatever we can...
Whatever we can carry, and that's it.
What do we do with the rest of it?
Fuck.
[exhales] Fuck me.
That'll work.
Snow will be coming in soon.
Nobody'll ever see it again.
Good.
All right, let's keep going.
[Santiago, softly] Let's put him down for a second.
[William] We're running behind.
Benny, you should go. The sun's coming up.
[Santiago] We'll meet you down at the cove in 30.
-[Benny] All right. Be careful. -[William] Always.
[Benny, in Spanish] Thank you for waiting.
[captain] The boat is ready.
[William, in English] No, wait. Whoa.
Is there anyone?
-It looks abandoned. -Cover me.
[fighter] Stop! [in Spanish] Hands up!
-[in English] Stop! -Put your hands up! [Santiago, in Spanish] Wait! Wait!
Listen!
Little brother, be careful with that gun. Don't point it at me.
[in English] I speak English! [grunts] What's in the bag? What is that?
[William] It's our friend.
-He's dead. -I call boss.
-[in Spanish] No, don't do that. -[in English] Stop!
[Santiago, in Spanish] We don't have any problem with you.
[in English] Right, guys? -We don't have a problem with him. -No problem.
-I'm taking a shot. -No! No. Don't do that.
[in Spanish] It's okay.
[Santiago] Hey, calm down.
Dumbass!
-[Santiago] Where are the keys? -I don't know.
They just left me here with just the car and the radio. [sniffles]
[in English] Fuck!
-[Santiago, in Spanish] Are you sure? -Yes.
[Santiago] Are you lying?
[in English] Hey, hey, kid, just relax, all right?
[man over radio, in Spanish] Sixteen? Sixteen, is that you?
We're going to send someone.
[in English] Yes! Fuck yes!
Let's move. Let's get it outta here.
-[Santiago] Grab his radio. -[William] Got it.
[Santiago, in Spanish] Here's a little advice:
Get away from these men. [Frankie, in English] Let's move!
[in Spanish] Go home. Get out of here. [Frankie] Vamos, Pope!
[in English] Did you give that fucking kid money?
We should have killed that kid as soon as he saw our faces.
We are not killing any more people.
I'll tell you right now, if we get to that beach and Ben isn't there,
I'm fucking killing people.
-All right, he'll be there. Fuck! -[car approaching]
[William] Fuck.
-Come on! Come on! -Can we go?
What the hell is this?
Shit!
[teen on radio in Spanish] They crashed into us! Look out, be careful!
[teen on radio in Spanish] They crashed into us! Look out, be careful! -They're heading to the beach. -[man on radio] They just passed.
-They're heading to the beach. -[man on radio] They just passed.
-Everybody head towards the palm trees. -[in English] What did he say?
-[Frankie] More are coming. -There's two vehicles!
All right, it should open up onto the beach any minute.
Pope, shoot!
Fuck!
Shoot the driver! What is wrong with you?
-[in English] Left! -[man, in Spanish] They're firing!
Stay behind!
[in English] They're right on us!
Where are they?
Left! Left!
Left!
[William] Goddamn!
All right, here's the beach.
Where is he? Do you see him?
No, but the cove where we're supposed to meet him's about a mile up this beach.
Pope, kill them!
Just kill them!
There it is!
-Do I wave him in? -[William] Hell yeah!
Go!
It looks like this is the end of the road.
[Frankie] I see it.
We gotta cross over the dune! Cross over the dune!
[woman] Minus the expenses, and our administrative fee,
that leaves $5,334,120...
cut five ways.
Which gives you five shares of $1,066,824.
Oh, and I need all of your signatures on the fifth contract here.
It'll deposit the deceased's share into the Redfly Family Trust.
Here you are.
I'd like you to please include my share into the family trust.
Me, too.
Thank you.
[woman] So, I will schedule all the payments to the family trust.
Of course.
-Thank you. That's for you. -Thank you. I'll be in touch.
[sighs] So, what are you guys gonna do now?
I gotta get home. [chuckles]
Not without these.
That'll help. [chuckles]
[in Spanish] See you.
Take care of yourself.
[in English] See you, buddy.
Love you, man.
[clicks tongue] I love you, too.
-I'll see you in a bit, all right? -[Benny] See you.
So, what you gonna do now?
[sighs] I don't know.
Maybe I'll, uh...
I'll go see this girl I know in Australia.
Yeah, you should. I hear she recently came into some money.
I guess she made out a whole hell of a lot better than any of us did.
That seems about right.
When you see Molly and the girls...
remind them who he was.
Yeah, I will.
Take care of yourself, all right?
Let me say, we don't really need to be here.
-See, we've been married five years. -Six.
Five, six years. And this is like a check-up for us.
A chance to poke around the engine, maybe change the oil.
A chance to poke around the engine, maybe change the oil. -Replace a seal or two. -He gets it.
-Replace a seal or two. -He gets it.
Very well then. Let's pop the hood.
On a scale of one to 10, how happy are you as a couple? -Eight. -Wait.
-Eight. -Wait. Ten being perfectly happy and one being totally miserable, or...?
Ten being perfectly happy and one being totally miserable, or...?
-Just respond instinctively. -Okay.
-Ready? -Ready.
-Eight. -Eight.
How often do you have sex?
I don't understand the question.
Yeah, I'm lost. Is this a one-to-10 thing?
Right, because, like, is one very little, or is one nothing?
Because, you know, technically speaking, the zero would be nothing.
How about this week?
-Including the weekend? -Sure.
Describe how you first met.
-It was in Colombia. -Bogotá.
Five years ago.
Six.
Right. Five or six years ago.
Hey.
Someone shot the barracuda.
Police are looking for tourists traveling alone.
Are you alone, sir?
Miss, your passport, please...
...your papers.
Are you alone?
No.
She's with me.
I'm Jane.
-John. -Nice to meet you.
-John. -Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
-To dodging bullets. -Dodging bullets.
So it speaks.
But does it dance?
Hi, stranger.
Hi back.
-I think room service fled. -Yeah?
I did what I could. Thank you.
Oh, that's good.
I hope so. I had to milk a goat to get it.
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen. Try your luck.
How about you, little lady? Wanna try your luck? Win a prize?
Yeah, all right.
-Two. -We got a two over here.
-You know how to hold it? -Step right up, have a shot.
-Five dollars. -Yup. -Yeah? -Yeah.
-You gotta aim. -I am.
Don't laugh, I'll kill you.
-How about you, sir? -You didn't blink.
Would you like to win a stuffed teddy bear for your little girl?
Come on. Everybody's a winner.
Do we still get something?
Beginner's luck.
-I wanna go again. -We're going again.
Everybody's a winner. Win a prize. Win a prize.
Everybody's a winner. Win a prize. Win a prize. Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
Beginner's luck.
Stop. Stop. You've only known the girl for six weeks.
I'm in love. She's smart, sexy.
I'm in love. She's smart, sexy. She's uninhibited, spontaneous...
She's uninhibited, spontaneous... ...complicated. She's the sweetest thing I've ever seen.
...complicated. She's the sweetest thing I've ever seen.
I knew Gladys two and a half years before I asked her to marry me.
You have to have a foundation of friendship, brother. The other stuff fades.
So you don't think this is all happening a little fast?
You know me. I never do anything without thinking it through.
-What does he do? -He's in construction.
-What does he do? -He's in construction. He's a bigtime contractor.
A server goes down on Wall Street, she's there, anytime, day or night.
She's like Batman for computers.
He's gone as much as I am, so it's perfect.
I give the whole thing six months, tops.
Eddie... ...I asked her to marry me.
What?
-I'm getting married. -What? I can't hear you.
-I'm getting married. -I can't hear. Can you stop hitting him?
-I think he said something crazy. -I'm getting married.
--cyanide. According to The New York Post...
--cyanide. According to The New York Post... ...the N.Y.P.D.'s Kevin Paris admitted....
...the N.Y.P.D.'s Kevin Paris admitted....
Gotta get these filters changed.
So, what did you think of Dr. Wexler? His questions were a bit wishy-washy.
-Yeah. Watch your arm. -I'm all right.
-Not the most insightful. -No.
And his office is clear across town.
Well, you know the 4:00, it means we hit rush hour.
-Right. -Not crazy about that.
-So that's settled then, yeah? -Okay.
Okay.
-Dinner's at 7. -Yup, I'll be there. Here.
Anybody calls, I'm in with the boss. Okay?
I got a call from the man. Big highline assignment, Steve.
You know how it is. Actually, you probably don't.
Excuse me, sweetie. Could you grab me a coffee?
I like it with lots of sugar. Thanks a lot.
Hey there.
-Where do you think you're going? -Rose...
-...the boss wants to see me. -Well, he sees you.
Look, kid, people who've been working here for 25 years...
...have never seen the inside of that elevator.
Here.
This is the assignment?
Now get out of here.
-Hey, babe. -Perfect timing.
It's pissing rain out there.
Gardener left the lawn mower out.
-How was work? -So-so.
Oh, I got new curtains.
Did you?
Well?
What do you think?
There was a struggle over the material.
This little tea sandwich of a man, he got his hands on them first.
This little tea sandwich of a man, he got his hands on them first. -But I won. -Of course you did.
They're a bit green. I think we have to reupholster the sofas...
...and get a new rug. Maybe a Persian.
Yeah, or we can just keep the old ones, then we don't have to change a thing.
We talked about this. You remember?
I remember. I remember because we said we'd wait.
If you don't like them, we can take them back.
Okay. I don't like them.
You'll get used to them.
Yeah.
Zero percent APR until March.
So part two. Here we are.
Only this time you came back alone. Why did you come back?
I'm not sure, really.
Let me clarify. I love my wife.
I want her to be happy.
I want good things for her.
But there are times....
-Honey, would you just--? -Five more minutes.
There's this huge space between us.
And it just keeps filling up with everything that we don't say to each other.
-What is that called? -Marriage.
What don't you say to each other?
The GMC Yukon got three stars.
This looks nice. Did you do something new?
-Yeah? -I added peas.
Yeah, peas.
Yeah, it's the green.
Sweetheart, will you pass the salt?
It's in the middle of the table.
-Oh, is that the middle of the table? -Yeah, it's between you and me.
-How honest are you with him? -Pretty honest.
-How honest are you with him? -Pretty honest. I mean, I--
It's not like I lie to him or anything. We just....
I have little secrets. Everybody has secrets. You know.
Jesus.
-Honey, you scared me. -I'm sorry, hon.
-Honey, you scared me. -I'm sorry, hon. I was looking for the....
You going out?
Some clown crashed a server in a law firm downtown...
...and ended the world as they know it, so yes.
We promised the Colemans.
-I know. -Okay.
I'll be there. In and out. Just a quickie.
Probably feels like you're the only people going through this, but I'll tell you...
...there are millions of couples that are experiencing the same problems.
-We got a plane in an hour. -All right.
-Who's Al Gore? -Right.
-Quotes, 800. -Prodded about possible insider trading...
...she remarked on national television, "I want to focus on my salad." Ryan?
-Martha Stewart. -Martha Stewart.
-Quotes for 1000. -Regarding Mick Jagger's knighthood...
...he scoffed, "It's a paltry honor, mate. Hold out for the lordship."
What the hell? What's this shite?
Sorry. Where's the can around here, for chrissake.
Take a-- Hey, you guys playing poker?
-Private game. Piss off. -Hey, could I sit in? You think I could--?
What part of "piss off" do you not understand?
Guys. Hey, whoa, whoa.
-Be a little friendly. I got the cash. I got-- -Easy, big fella.
That's cool, man. You're cool.
Listen-- Look, see? You see what I'm saying?
Listen-- Look, see? You see what I'm saying? See what I'm saying? Anyone interested?
See what I'm saying? Anyone interested?
-Anyone interested? -No.
Because I'll clean you out. I understand. Fine.
Because I'll clean you out. I understand. Fine. Listen, I want-- These are really nice shoes, man.
Listen, I want-- These are really nice shoes, man.
Jesus.
-Here's an empty chair. I could sit here. -That is Lucky's chair.
Where's Lucky? I don't see Lucky.
-Lucky's not back yet. -Then I'll sit here.
-Lucky's not back yet. -Then I'll sit here. Unless...
...I'm too hot for you.
-Solid silver. -Raises. Nice.
"To dodging bullets. Love, Jane."
In the pot. Put it in the pot.
Oh, he's pulled something. He's pulled something. You're in trouble now.
-Sixty dollars, eh? -In.
Look at him. Look at the big man. -Cheers. -Hey.
-Let's play some poker. -All right. Come on.
-Fives. -He's got 14 different tells. You are bleeding William Tell.
-What the hell is this? -Sorry, Lucky.
Looks like you're done, pal. Thanks for the memories.
-You're Lucky? -Yeah.
No kidding.
What is it, kid? You looking for a job or something?
You are the job.
Pair of threes.
-Have you been a bad boy? -Yes.
You know what happens to bad boys?
-They get punished. -Oh, yeah. Punish me.
Have you been selling big guns to bad people?
Mr. Racin? Mr. Racin? You okay?
Mr. Racin? You okay?
The Colemans.
He's down.
Taxi?
-Hey, hon. -Hey, baby.
I didn't hear you downstairs.
Yeah, I went to the sports bar. Put some money on the game.
Yeah? How'd you do?
I got lucky.
-Welcome, neighbors. -Hey.
-Hi, Susan. -Good to see you, John.
-Hi. -There you go. -This is wonderful. -Thank you.
-This is wonderful. -Thank you.
Let me get your coat. What a lovely dress. -Thank you very much. So is yours. -Oh, thanks.
-Come on, let's go see the girls. -Don't stray too far, guys.
You want a Cuban?
Oh, no, no, no. I don't smoke.
Oh, no, no, no. I don't smoke. Clean body, clean soul. That's what Suzy says.
-Ain't that the truth. -You guys have any vices?
Well, you know.
-Can I get you a drink? -Yes. Chardonnay, please.
-Girls? -Chardonnay.
-Daddy, Daddy, Daddy. -Let's go, kid.
I'll be up here at the filling station.
-I heard their stock's getting butchered. -Hey, boys. Scotch?
-I heard their stock's getting butchered. -Hey, boys. Scotch? -Yes, sir. -It's a bloodbath over there.
John-o, how'd you make out last quarter? You take a beating?
Actually, I got all my dough buried under the toolshed.
So Chuck got the promotion.
-Oh, my God, that is so great. -Fantastic.
He's so excited. We can finally put the addition on the kitchen.
Oh, shoot. Not again.
I should've worn a raincoat.
You know what? We-- -Can you hold her for a second? -What? No.
-Can you hold her for a second? -What? No. -Please. It's all over the appliqué. -I'd rather not. No, I'm--
-Please. It's all over the appliqué. -I'd rather not. No, I'm-- -Please, just.... -Okay. Sure.
Seltzer.
She likes you.
I liked your dress tonight.
It was nice.
Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Smith. There's trouble in Atlanta again.
That's what I hear. What you got?
I've got your boarding pass, and taxi receipts.
-Get rid of that gun-- Gum. -You got a tissue?
-And your hotel bill. Don't lose those. -Thanks.
Keep them in the envelope. You'll need them for your cover.
We got the new specs for the dam.
-Great, Louie. I'll check those out. -Here you go.
-Hey, is Eddie here? -The door's unlocked.
-Morning, pal. -How you doing?
Same old same old. People need killing.
Johnny, might have a little get-together this weekend at my house.
Barbecue, no ladies, dudes only. It's gonna be awesome.
I'll talk to the missus.
You wanna use my cell phone? Maybe wanna give her a call...
...in case you decide to scratch your ass or use the head later.
-Make sure she thinks it's okay. -You live with your mother.
Why would you bring her into this? She's a first-class lady.
And I don't have to check in with her every time I wanna do something.
And I don't have to check in with her every time I wanna do something. She cooks, she cleans. She makes me snacks.
I'm the dumb guy?
John Smith.
Hello, John.
Morning, Atlanta.
Quite the body count this week.
We have a priority one, so I need your expertise.
The target's name is Benjamin Danz, aka The Tank.
The target's name is Benjamin Danz, aka The Tank. He's a direct threat to the firm. DIA custody.
He's a direct threat to the firm. DIA custody.
They're making a ground-to-air handoff to heli...
...10 miles north of the Mexican border.
I need you to make sure the target does not change hands.
The Tank?
-I-Temp Technology staffing. -Jane Smith confirmed.
-I-Temp Technology staffing. -Jane Smith confirmed. Stand by for contact.
Sorry to interrupt, but we have a situation.
You know the competition would love to see us burn.
So I need you to handle this personally.
-Target? -Benjamin Danz.
-Target? -Benjamin Danz. I'm rolling the specs now. We need this quick, clean, and contained.
I'm rolling the specs now. We need this quick, clean, and contained.
Yes, sir.
-Ladies. -Good morning.
-Morning. -Hello, Jane.
Yesterday's op resulted in one kill and one agent in protective custody.
-We'll get him out tomorrow. -Two cases of the G-40s.
-The grenade launchers are here. -Order 10 more.
All right. Go, Jas.
The target's name is Benjamin Danz, aka The Tank.
-You serious? -Yeah.
The target's being moved across the border to a federal facility.
The only point of vulnerability is just south of the border.
I want GPS and SAC of the canyon and the weather report for the last three days.
Target will rendezvous with the helicopter here at a deserted airstrip.
We will have one chance to strike.
Oh, look. More desert.
-Are we green? -Perimeter is armed.
-Are we green? -Perimeter is armed. We are up and running.
Red Team, Red Team, this is Broadway Joe.
Halftime is approaching.
Copy that, Broadway Joe.
Oh, come on.
-You getting this? -Affirmative. Is it a threat?
Countdown's initiated. Convoy is not in the zone yet.
There's an idiot's in the field. He's gonna blow the charges.
You gotta be kidding me.
Civilians.
Let's see if I can't get a tune out of this trombone.
We're picking up a weapon signature.
Shit. Not a civilian.
Man.
Asshole.
Convoy's in the zone. Countdown's initiated.
You should so not be allowed to buy these things.
Abort. Abort.
I think I got ID'd on that hit. You ever been ID'd on a hit?
-Not that I'm aware of, no. -Right. I think I'm in trouble.
You get a look at him?
Little thing. Buck-10, buck-15, tops.
Maybe he's Filipino.
I'm not even sure it was a him.
Are you saying that you had your ass handed to you by some girl?
I think so. A pro.
Well, this shouldn't be that difficult.
How many chicks are hitters out there, know what I mean?
You guys want any dessert? -What do you have, honey? -Ice cream.
-What do you have, honey? -Ice cream.
Ice cream? Sounds delicious. What flavors do you have?
-Chocolate and vanilla. -I don't like those, separately.
But maybe mixed together, that could be a nice little dish. Know what I mean?
And not just the little pink spoon, I like the whole sundae.
-Could be arranged. -Perfect.
Did you hear that? I'd like to have her kick my ass. Know what I mean?
Right.
You get any other details on her besides her weight class?
-Laptop. -I'm sorry? You're in a zone right now.
-Laptop. -I'm sorry? You're in a zone right now. -I'm having a hard time. -Laptop.
-I'm having a hard time. -Laptop.
Okay. Laptop.
I wanna know who that bitch is. Get me that tape.
-Jane. -Get me that tape.
-What? -It's Father.
The FBI secured the package. The window's closed, sir.
-I told you we couldn't afford any mistakes. -There was another player.
We do not leave witnesses. If this player ID'd you.... You know the rules.
You have 48 hours to clean the scene, Jane.
Looking forward to it, sir.
All right, we have a new target. Let's find out who he is.
Jesus. What did you do to it?
Put a campfire out with it? Buy a new one.
This one has sentimental value for its owner.
Who's that?
Well, Gwen, I was hoping you'd tell me.
So why you gotta know so bad, anyway?
You know me, just trying to return some lost property.
-Hey, Phil. -Hey, John.
-Are you a vegan? -No.
-Are you a vegan? -No. My girlfriend is.
Here we go.
Upgraded RAM module.
Chip's Chinese.
Imported by Dynamix. Retailed by....
You know what? I might be able to get you a billing address.
All right. No name, just an address.
570 Lexington Avenue, Suite 5003.
New York. You know the place?
Sweet Jesus. Mother of God.
Why don't you both go make some coffee?
Jane, it's your husband.
He's back from Atlanta. He wants to know about dinner.
Tell him... ...dinner's at 7.
Hi, John. Yeah, she says dinner's at 7.
It always is.
Perfect timing.
As always.
-This is a nice surprise. -I hope so.
-You're home early. -I missed you.
I missed you too.
-Shall we? -Yes.
Thought you only broke these out for special occasions.
This is a special occasion.
Pot roast. My favorite.
Allow me, sweetheart.
Been on your feet all day.
Thank you.
Sure.
So how's work?
Actually, we had a little trouble with a commission.
-Is that right? -Yeah.
Double booking with another firm.
-Green beans? -No, thank you.
You'll have some.
I hope everything works out okay.
It hasn't yet.
But it will.
Pot roast is my favorite.
Sweetheart, could you pass the salt?
You tried something new?
How was Atlanta?
Had a few problems ourselves. Some figures didn't add up.
-Big deal? -Life or death. Wine?
Yeah.
-I got it. -I got it. I'll get a towel.
Janey?
Honey?
Jane.
How could I be so stupid?
Jane. Jane.
Oh, dear God.
Wait. No, no, no. Accident.
Honey? Accident.
Jane, stop the car, now.
Wait.
You're overreacting.
Let's not get carried away.
We don't wanna go to sleep angry.
-We can talk this out. -God.
Pull over.
Pull over. Pull over.
Now, look....
We need to talk.
Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming. -Who is it? -Open up.
-Who is it? -Open up.
-What the hell happened to you? -My wife.
She tried to kill me.
Yes, she did. And you know what? Gladys tried to kill me. Not with a car.
At least Jane was a man about it. Upfront about it. But they all try to kill you.
Slowly, painfully, cripplingly. And then, wham, they hurt you.
You know how hurt I used to be over her? I used to beat myself up. Now I'm great.
You know how hurt I used to be over her? I used to beat myself up. Now I'm great. I got dates all the time. I just woke up from a thing, I'm in my robe.
I got dates all the time. I just woke up from a thing, I'm in my robe.
-You live with your mom. -I choose to.
-You live with your mom. -I choose to. Because that's the only woman I've ever trusted.
-It's unbelievable. -Look, I know exactly what you're thinking.
-It's unbelievable. -Look, I know exactly what you're thinking. If she lied about that, what else is it possible that she lied about?
If she lied about that, what else is it possible that she lied about?
I mean, her job is a spy, to get information from people.
French Riviera. A yacht. An Iranian prince.
She's supposed to get close to him and gain his trust. It's disgusting.
What? What are you saying?
What? Your husband is the shooter?
That's impossible.
Really?
This whole thing was probably planned from the beginning.
Operation Stakeout Johnny.
A six-year stakeout to get information from you.
Mission accomplished.
Okay... ...here's the upside.
-You don't love him. -No.
You'll kill him, and nobody's better at that than you are.
Thank you.
And then it'll be over.
I know you're embarrassed, but come on, it's me.
It's Eddie you're talking to.
The guys we work with, they don't know. I'm never gonna tell them.
The guys we work with, they don't know. I'm never gonna tell them. The people she works with, they probably got a big laugh over this...
The people she works with, they probably got a big laugh over this...
...but so what? That's not important.
Lookit, it's like 150 pages of a book have been written.
In the first 150 pages, Johnny's been a clown.
But you can write the last 10 pages. You've been smoked...
...but you can write the last 10.
Great talk. We should do it more often. It was a great talk. I'm proud of you.
-I'm gonna borrow this. -I like where your head's at, man.
-I'll do it in the morning. -Yeah, yeah.
-You okay? -Yup.
-Okay. Good night. -Night.
You don't love him.
-Night, Johnny. -Night, Eddie.
Good night, Mom.
Okay, girls. Let's go.
Pocket litter, receipts, matchbooks. You know the drill.
This is nice. Who picked this out?
-What is this? -It looks like your wedding.
-I know what it is. What are you doing? -Research. Background on the target.
This room is wrapped. Thank you.
--to have and to hold, to love and to cherish, till death do us part.
I promise.
I, John, take you, Jane, to be my lawfully wedded wife, to have and to ho--
There's more coming out of the house.
What is going on?
What's going on, Mrs. Smith?
Garden party, girls.
Howdy, neighbor.
Wow, I can't believe I've never been in here before. This is great.
-Start with the living room. -Oh, yeah.
-I love the floors. What are they, teak? -Red oak, Martin. Red oak.
And you won the Golf Masters trophy this year. Again.
Again. That'll be sitting on your mantel next year.
Bitch.
Target profile is our main priority.
Utilize all means necessary.
Phone taps. Credit cards. Audio scan civilian frequencies.
With what, Jane?
You've reached the Smiths. We can't take your call right now...
...but leave a message after the tone and we'll get back to you.
-And search the database. -For what? "John Smith"?
Find him.
-Jane? -What?
I think I found him.
-Where? -Here.
Heat-sensor breach in the perimeter.
Commence scanning all floors.
I thought I told you not to bother me at the office, honey.
-Well, you are still Mrs. Smith. -Well, so are a lot of girls.
Careful. I can push the button anytime, anywhere, sweetheart.
Baby, you couldn't find the button with both hands and a map.
Last warning. You need to disappear.
-No. -Now.
D sector clear.
You expect me to roll over and play dead?
You should be used to it after five years of marriage.
Six. And I'm not leaving.
E sector clear.
Anywhere, anytime.
Intruder detected.
Evacuate plan C.
Evacuation in progress.
Evacuation in progress.
Evacuation in progress.
Evacuation in progress.
Evacuation in progress.
I've already done this side.
Go.
Chickenshit.
Pussy.
You had a shot at her and you didn't take it?
We got all this stuff here and you're trying to tell me you couldn't take her out?
Well, now she's a problem for both of us.
Now my house is priority one.
Just give me a hand, will you?
You're driving me crazy with the tongs in the furnace. You're like an insane man.
All right, they gave you 48 hours.
What have we got left here? Twenty-three? Twenty-two?
-Eighteen and change. -You got 18 hours...
-...until they close the book on both of you? -Eddie?
Mom! We're on high alert here!
I almost killed you right then. You do not even realize.
Never mind.
I am so done playing games with this broad.
-You gotta take this bitch out head-on. -Don't tell me how to handle my wife.
This broad's not your wife. She's the enemy. -And she could be outside right now. -Eddie.
-And she could be outside right now. -Eddie. Got it.
Now we're talking. Only question is, how much is it to buy a vowel?
-Blackbow Realty. -Yes, hi, I'm calling from I-Temp.
Oh, great. How's that new penthouse working out?
Well, just fine, thank you for asking.
This is security. There seems to be a problem with your elevator, sir.
Do you want an engineer to come up and see what the problem is?
Take your time, I'm really quite comfortable.
And are you really comfortable?
Jane?
Is that you, sweetheart?
First and last warning, John. Get out of town.
You know I'm not going anywhere.
Oh, well, so you say.
But right now, you're trapped in a steel box hanging 70 floors over nothing but air.
-Oh, so this is a trap? -He's in Car 3.
It's never gonna work, honey.
It's never gonna work, because you constantly underestimate me.
-Do I? -You have no idea who I am.
You have no idea what I'm capable of.
-Well, back at you, baby. -Let me guess.
Shaped charge on the counterbalance cable...
...two more on the primary and secondary brakes? Maybe?
-He found them. -Yes, thank you.
Did you also get the base charge at the principle cable?
Promise to leave town, or I'll blow it.
Okay. I give up. Blow it.
I give up. Blow it.
What?
Go on, blow it.
-You think I won't? -I think you won't.
Okay.
Five, four.... -Any last words? -The new curtains are hideous?
-Any last words? -The new curtains are hideous?
Goodbye, John.
-What the hell was that? -What?
-What the hell was that? -What? You said goodbye.
What was that? Guys, shut it down!
Cut the gas! Cut the gas! Shut off the gas!
-It's sparking still. -We cut off the gas.
Jane.
Madame.
I thought of a number of lines for this moment.
"Thought I'd just drop in." "Hey, doll. Thanks for giving me the shaft."
Nice. So what did you decide?
I want a divorce.
I like it. You proposed to me here, so it has agreeable symmetry.
Coat, sir?
-May I sit? -No.
-Champagne, sir? -No, champagne's for celebrating.
-I'll have a martini. -I'm fine, thank you.
So, what do you want, John?
We have an unusual problem, Jane.
You obviously want me dead.
And I'm less and less concerned of your well-being.
So, what do we do?
We shoot it out here? Hope for the best?
That would be a shame...
...because they would probably ask me to leave once you're dead.
Dance with me.
You don't dance.
That was just part of my cover, sweetheart.
Was sloth part of it too?
You think this story's gonna have a happy ending.
Happy endings are just stories that haven't finished yet.
Satisfied?
Not for years.
It's all John, sweetheart.
Why is it you think we failed?
Because we were leading separate lives? Or was it all the lying that did us in?
I have a theory. Newly formed.
-I'm breathless to hear it. -You killed us.
-I'm breathless to hear it. -You killed us. Provocative.
You approached our marriage like a job.
Something to be reconned, planned and executed.
And you avoided it.
What do you care, if I was just a cover?
Who said you were just a cover?
Wasn't I?
Wasn't I?
I have to-- Excuse me.
No exits up there, Jane.
Be cold, John. She's a liar.
Be super cold.
Come on, madam. This way. Right to the exits.
Do you know that you're ticking?
Get back. Get back. Get back.
Limo, sir?
Jane Smith. That's the second time you tried to kill me.
Oh, come on. It was just a little bomb.
I'm going home and I'm gonna burn everything I ever bought you.
I'll race you there, baby.
You there yet? The first time we met, what was your first thought?
You tell me.
I thought....
I thought you looked like Christmas morning.
I don't know how else to say it.
And why are you telling me this now?
I guess in the end you start thinking about the beginning.
So there it is. I thought you should know.
So how about it, Jane?
I thought....
I thought that you were the most beautiful mark I'd ever seen.
-So it was all business, yeah? -All business.
-So it was all business, yeah? -All business. -From the go. -Cold, hard math.
-From the go. -Cold, hard math.
Thank you. That's what I needed to know.
Okay. Okay.
Hey, John.
Hey, Bill.
-Are you all right? -Yeah.
Okay.
By the way, John, your car is hanging out over the sidewalk here.
-Yeah, thanks, Bill. -Okay. Have a good night.
Good night.
Shit.
You still alive, baby?
Your aim's as bad as your cooking, sweetheart.
And that's saying something.
Come on, honey.
Come to Daddy.
Who's your daddy now?
I can't-- Can't do it.
Don't. Come on. Come on.
You want it? It's yours.
Hi, stranger.
Hi back.
-Yeah? -Is everything okay?
We heard an awful ruckus.
No, everything's fine here. -Yeah, it's great. -So you guys are fine?
-Yeah, it's great. -So you guys are fine?
Yeah, couldn't be better.
Nice. You guys are--?
-Suzy, Martin. Officers. -Have a nice night.
Looks like you're redecorating, it's very.... Yeah. Shame about the red oak.
Five more minutes, Ma.
Tempting. I don't get out of bed for less than half a million dollars.
-That left of yours, a thing of beauty. -You take it well.
-That left of yours, a thing of beauty. -You take it well. Thank you.
That vacation in Aspen?
You left early. Why?
-Jean-Luc Gaspard. -Oh, God.
-I wanted him. -Forget it.
You didn't hear me that night the chopper dropped me off for our anniversary dinner?
-No. -No?
Percussion grenades. I was partially deaf that night.
I'm slightly color blind.
-Retinal scarring. -I can't feel anything in these three fingers.
Three ribs. Broken eye socket. Perforated eardrum.
You ever have trouble sleeping after?
-Nope. -Yeah, me neither.
Eight o'clock.
Go. Go, go, go. Look out.
Move it.
Shoes.
I was given 48 hours to take you out.
Same.
Jesus, where's the trust?
What do you expect?
Why do I get the girl gun?
-Are you kidding me? -No.
They're outside!
We need a car.
Colemans.
Guy's had my barbecue set for months.
-I was never in the Peace Corps. -What?
I really liked that about you.
-Maybe this honesty thing isn't a good idea. -No, no, no.
-I didn't go to MIT. -Really?
Notre Dame. Art History major.
-Art? -History.
-Art? -History. -It's reputable. -Okay.
-It's reputable. -Okay.
Fuckers get younger every year.
I have to tell you, I never really liked your cooking.
It's not your gift.
Baby, I've never cooked a day in my life.
I-Temp girls cooked.
Web of lies.
I like it. Deal with it.
-We got company. -What?
Shit.
-Baby, hold steady, now. -It's called evasive driving, sweetheart.
Hold still.
This thing's all over the place.
-How do you drive these things anyways? -Honey.
Honey, let me drive.
-I got it. -Move over.
-I got it. -Move over. Move.
I'm the suburban housewife, sweetheart.
-You move. -Fine. Go.
-Go. -Go. -Go. -Go.
They're bulletproof.
They're bulletproof.
Honey, I should probably tell you...
...I was married once before.
-What is wrong with you? -You're what's wrong with me.
-It was a drunken Vegas thing. -That's better.
-Stop. Stop it. -That's much better. That's great.
Stop it.
Go, go, go.
What's her name and social security number?
No, you're not gonna kill her.
These doors are handy.
You know, sweetheart, you're being a bit hypocritical.
It's not like you're some beacon of truth.
John, my parents...
...they died when I was 5. I'm an orphan.
Who was that kindly fellow who gave you away at our wedding?
Paid actor.
I said. I said I saw your dad on Fantasy Island.
I know.
I don't even wanna talk about it.
-You got it? -Got it.
-Any time. -I got it.
We're gonna have to redo every conversation we've ever had.
I'm Jewish.
I can't believe I brought my real parents to our wedding.
Disgusting. How could you serve this to someone?
Excuse me, ma'am, is it possible to get this reheated?
Miss, I'm talking to you. Excuse me.
Jesus, Johnny.
-Good morning, Eddie. -Morning.
It's good to see you're okay, man.
Tell me you got smart and that killed that lying bitch.
This lying bitch?
Guess it was just wishful thinking. -I'm sorry. -Eddie, we--
-It's nice to see you, Jane. -Eddie. Eddie. Focus, please.
-We got problems. -You got problems?
-We got problems. -You got problems? Crack addicts got problems, my friend. You two are smoked.
Crack addicts got problems, my friend. You two are smoked.
-Maybe. -"Maybe." John, you got the entire agency gunning for you.
Probably have her agency gunning for you too.
-And what about you? -Me?
-Where you at? -Where am I at?
I find myself dragging my feet this morning.
I think you owe me a little money, anyway.
We don't understand each other, and I understand that.
But I don't need those looks from you. I been in his life a long time.
-Eddie. Focus. -I been in his life for a long time.
I'm pissed off. They blew up my house, they shot at my wife. My own company.
If she works for who the street says that she works for...
...you're Macy's and Gimbel's.
Then she would be the WE channel, and you would be....
Whatever channel it is that competes against the WE channel.
You following me? Johnny, the point of this is simple.
Once you decide to get off the reservation, that's it. You're off the reservation.
Once you decide to get off the reservation, that's it. You're off the reservation. Eddie, how bad?
How bad is it?
You remember Canada. That was kids' stuff next to what you're up against.
-That was you? -Oh, is that a turn-on?
-That was you? -Oh, is that a turn-on? -Didn't she try to kill you with a car? -Stop.
-Didn't she try to kill you with a car? -Stop. A good friend stays out of it. I understand. This is the facts.
A good friend stays out of it. I understand. This is the facts.
If you two separate from each other, you got a shot.
Not a great shot, Johnny, but you got a shot.
If you two stay together, you're dead.
Unless you can find something that they want more than they want you.
Found him. He's being held in sub-basement D of the federal courthouse.
High security, motion and thermal. Power's on a city grid.
This is as far as we go, Jane.
Right. -Thanks for everything. -Good luck, babe.
-Thanks for everything. -Good luck, babe.
Do one of you guys mind changing the channel?
Nick? Would you please get off your fat ass and change the channel?
I know, it's tough. Thank you.
--that's going to make things even colder than they are right now.
Thirty-second window. I cut the power, you grab the kid. Simple and clean. Got it?
Thirty-second window. I cut the power, you grab the kid. Simple and clean. Got it? Got it.
Tell me, how many?
Does it matter?
-Should I go first? -Okay.
I don't exactly keep count...
...but I would say... ...high 50s, low 60s.
...high 50s, low 60s.
I've been around the block, but, you know, the important thing is--
I've been around the block, but, you know, the important thing is-- Three-hundred and twelve.
Three-hundred and twelve? -How? -Some were two at a time.
-How? -Some were two at a time.
Honey? I'm-- I'm-- I'm....
-Monitoring the perimeter? -I checked the perimeter.
-What about the police bands? -I'm on the police bands.
-Connected to--? -This is not my first time.
Think we've established that.
All right.
Turn left.
Left, John. Left.
You don't have to talk to me like that. Okay? Be nice.
-Left, please? -I can't go left.
-Left, please? -I can't go left. See? There is no left. Look.
See? There is no left. Look. I have straight, or back the way I came.
There's no left. Which way do you want me to go?
-Just stay there and wait for my mark. -See what I'm sitting in?
-Just stay there and wait for my mark. -See what I'm sitting in? You see that?
-Take your time. -Yeah. All right. Stay.
Stay, wait for my mark. I'll find it.
Wait for my mark.
Almost there. I don't know what happened. Just hold on.
What are you--? John, what are doing? What are you doing?
Cut the lights on my signal.
Now. Kill the lights.
Jane, kill the lights.
-Hey, what's that? -Where? No, no, not now. Turn them back on.
Idiot. -Here they come. -Hey, Nick, uncuff me.
-Here they come. -Hey, Nick, uncuff me.
Turn them back. Turn them back on. Turn them back on.
-Turn them back on. Turn them on. -All right.
-Give me light. Give me light. -Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
-Nick. -Shut up.
Give me a gun. -Nick, give me a gun. -Zip it.
This guy's a wily one.
I told you to wait for my signal. You didn't wait.
-Well, I improvised. -You deviated from the plan.
-The plan was flawed. -The plan was not flawed.
Anal. -Organized. -Jane, 90 percent of this job is instinct.
-Organized. -Jane, 90 percent of this job is instinct.
-Your instincts set off every alarm. -My instincts got the job done.
-Your instincts set off every alarm. -My instincts got the job done. -May not have been The Jane Show-- -It was The John Show. It was half-assed.
-May not have been The Jane Show-- -It was The John Show. It was half-assed.
-May not have been The Jane Show-- -It was The John Show. It was half-assed. Like Christmas, our anniversary.
Like the time you forgot to bring my mother's birthday present.
Your fake-mother's birthday.
The point is, you are always the first to break team.
You don't want a team, you want a servant for hire.
I want someone I can count on.
Jane, there's no air around you anymore.
Jane, there's no air around you anymore. What is that supposed to mean?
It means there's no room for mistakes. No mistakes whatsoever. No spontaneity.
-Who can answer to that? -Well, you don't have to, do you?
-Who can answer to that? -Well, you don't have to, do you? Because this isn't even a real marriage.
-Who are you people? -Shut up.
Okay, so now, I realize...
...you witnessed the missus and I working through some domestic issues.
That's regrettable.
But don't take that as a sign of weakness. That would be a mistake on your part.
But don't take that as a sign of weakness. That would be a mistake on your part. Now, tell us what you know.
Why do both our bosses want you dead?
You under--? Honey. Please.
Wrap it up.
Maybe it's not such a good idea to undermine me in front of the hostage.
Sends a mixed message.
Sorry. Girls.
Okay.... Where was I?
Okay.... Where was I? -A mistake on your part. -Shut up. Options.
-A mistake on your part. -Shut up. Options.
I'm gonna lay out your options for you, okay?
-Option A-- -If I could-- Shut up. Option A: You talk, we listen, no pain.
Option A: You talk, we listen, no pain.
Option B: You don't talk... ...I remove your thumbs with my pliers. It will hurt.
...I remove your thumbs with my pliers. It will hurt.
Option C:
I like to vary the details a bit, but the punch line is, you die.
-Benjamin? We're impatient people. -Okay, okay. Okay.
Can I get a soda? Or a juice, or some--?
A. A. Option A. -That hurt. -Okay, that was a nice shot.
-That hurt. -Okay, that was a nice shot.
-What's--? You have a spasm? -I'm tied up.
-What's--? You have a spasm? -I'm tied up. Why don't you check my back pocket?
I'm not the target. You are. Both of you. They found out you're married...
Both of you. They found out you're married...
...so they teamed up and sent you to the same hit to target each other.
It was a joint task force by both your companies.
Two competing agents living under the same roof is bad for business.
-They wanted you to take each other out. -You were bait.
It's entry level. Toehold into the company.
Couple hits, they bump me up to a desk.
-It's pretty cool actually. -So you keep the photo in your pocket?
-It's pretty cool actually. -So you keep the photo in your pocket? -What, was I supposed to frame it? -You get rid of it. You burn it.
-What, was I supposed to frame it? -You get rid of it. You burn it.
-Tradecraft 101. -I'm sorry, I guess I skipped that day.
Just like I guess you skipped the day about not marrying the enemy.
You were bait or you are bait?
Belt. Belt, belt, dude.
Two minutes.
One minute.
Don't get any closer.
A little help?
-Clear. -Clear.
My way out is a boat standing by in La Paz.
Cargo drop, Atlas Mountains. So what?
So at least apart we know what the odds are.
Let's just call this what it is. And what it isn't.
All right, so it's a crap marriage. All right?
I'm a mess, you're a disaster.
We're both liars.
But you run, you'll always be running.
I say we stay and fight.
We finish this thing.
Then if you wanna go, you can go. Well, thank you.
What? "Let's call this what it is." Jesus Christ.
-Stop-- -Don't.
This is a really good store.
-See you in the next life, Jane. -Likewise, John.
Sorry.
We'll talk about this later.
Jesus.
-I didn't touch a thing. -Yes, you did.
-I'm sorry about the knife in-- -I don't wanna talk about it.
-I'll fly. -I'll be bait.
I'm going clockwise. Watch my six.
Go. Move.
How's it look?
It's a piece of cake.
Watch these, they tend to jam. So watch them.
You favor your left, sweetheart, so I'll cover right.
Damn, that boat in La Paz is looking pretty good right now, isn't it?
Well, it rains a lot this time of year.
There's nowhere I'd rather be than right here, with you.
Shut up.
I'm interested in the progress you've made in the last few weeks.
I'm interested in the progress you've made in the last few weeks. Doing all right, aren't we?
I mean, listen, I'm not gonna lie to you. There were times I just wanted to...
-...kill her, but.... -Likewise.
-Couldn't take the shot. -That's a good sign.
-Who'd have thought? -Sometimes you have to battle through.
-That's marriage, right? -Yeah, you take your best shot, and....
Oh, we redid the house.
We did. Yes, we did.
You know there will always be challenges?
-Threats out there? -Yup.
But you can handle it together.
-So far. -Yes, we can-- So far?
-So far. -Yes, we can-- So far? What is that?
-I'm leaving room for the unknown. -"So far."
And do you feel that your relationship styles are more conducive to this--?
Ask us the sex question.
There's too many of them!
Stand fast! [grunts]
Where's B-127?
[Bumblebee] Sorry I'm late. I hit a little traffic.
[Autobot 1] Get down! Incoming!
[Bumblebee] Uh, Optimus.
[Decepticon 2] Decepticons, attack!
Autobots, fall back!
Get to the tower!
[Decepticon 3] Destroy the launch pad!
Let none escape!
[Optimus] Cybertron has fallen.
Get to the escape pods.
There are other Autobots scattered across the galaxy.
We must reach them if we hope to survive.
Optimus, this is our home. We have to fight for it.
We will fight on.
But we must find refuge first.
I found a planet that's well hidden.
Earth.
You will travel there and establish a base for us.
Once we've gathered the others, we'll join you.
You must protect the planet.
If the Decepticons find it,
then our people are truly finished.
Now go!
Good luck, soldier.
I'll buy you some time.
No! Ow! Ow! Ow! Okay, okay! I'm dead already, man!
Okay, okay! I'm dead already, man!
[scoffs] Oh, not just you.
Being the overachiever that you are,
you managed to get your whole squad killed, Danny.
-Bravo. -Come on, man. Those things sting.
What things? These things? Ow!
You know, I wouldn't know. I haven't been hit yet.
Ow! Okay, you know what? That's too close, man.
-[soldiers laughing] -You could've taken out an eye.
I got a date tonight, man. This ain't sexy!
-You're right. I'm sorry. -Ow!
-That one was on me. -[yelping]
That's a malfunctioning trigger.
This weapon is just faulty.
Someone is going to get a talking to... Man, would you stop?
All right, just stop.
[sighs] I should've let you die in Grenada.
If you did, we wouldn't be able to come to the forest,
run around and play these awesome games. [Danny] Exactly.
[muffled] Oh, I hate you.
[muffled] Oh, I hate you. Wow, man, that hurts.
'Cause I love you. But you refuse to let it in 'cause you got intimacy issues.
A therapist will probably tell you you weren't hugged enough as a kid.
-Look, man. -Danny, I know I look stupid, but...
-Hey, yo, take cover! -[grunts]
-[groans] Danny. -[coughs]
You okay?
Uh, yeah, man. [grunts]
This is Agent Jack Burns.
I need medical up here now.
We have a projectile strike in the northwest corner of the training course.
Multiple injuries.
And would someone please explain to me why you dropped napalm on your own guys!
[soldier on radio] Negative.
There are no live army drills in the northwest sector.
What the hell hit us, then?
[soldier 1] Target on your right!
I need all of you to fan out and track that thing down now!
Drive!
There!
What the hell?
Take it down!
Get down there now and flush that thing out!
[soldier 2] There it is!
[soldier 2 on radio] Target has been located, sir.
Light it up!
Damn it!
Oh, no.
It's going for the mine!
Cut it off!
[soldier] Move, move!
[Bumblebee] Please.
This is a mistake.
Stay cool. Hold your fire.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
Who called in the Air Force?
That's not the Air Force.
Run.
Did you think you could hide?
Now you'll die screaming.
-Like your friends! -[both grunting]
Tell me where your friends are hiding.
I'll never talk.
Is that right?
Then let's make it official.
B-127...
as a member of the Autobot resistance,
you are a traitor to Cybertron
and are hereby sentenced
to death.
No!
No!
Shut up.
Morning, Dad.
[Sally] No! Don't tickle.
Uh-oh!
Caught.
-Gross, Ron. -[Sally laughing]
Excuse me.
Wha-- Are those your diving trophies?
Taking up too much space in my room.
You're gonna regret doing that.
Where's breakfast?
Breakfast is conveniently located in the cupboards and the fridge.
-Ah. -[Sally] Try to help out...
-Yeah. -...a little.
Since I'm such a big kid now, making my own breakfast and what have you.
You know how I could be an even bigger help around here, Mom?
If I had a car.
Charlie.
What do you know, it's my birthday tomorrow,
perfect timing for a large cash gift.
You know, $500 is really all I need to finish the Corvette.
I don't have $500. You know how much nurses make.
"Half as much as doctors for twice the work," right?
Tell you what, kiddo...
I got another job interview tomorrow.
If all goes well, I'll have you swimming in car parts.
-[Conan whining] -I prefer cash, Ron.
Don't be rude. Feed the dog.
Conan is Otis's dog. Make him do it. [Otis] What?
[Sally] Aw! You look so grown up in your karate suit.
My baby boy is becoming a man.
Oh, shoot, I'm gonna be late.
Can you drop your brother at karate on your way to work, please?
Um, I could if I had a car.
Just let him follow you on your bike so nobody abducts him.
Abducts him?
You just said he's a grown man now. If anyone tries anything, I will rupture their freaking spleen.
If anyone tries anything, I will rupture their freaking spleen.
-That's two for you guys. -[man] Thanks, bro.
All right. Have a good one.
Eat safe. [chuckles]
Excuse me. Hi. We've never actually met...
Sorry, I can't right now.
-Yeah. Oh, okay. -[girls giggling]
-[girl] Whoo! -[boy] Hey, hot dog girl!
-[Charlie] Oh, my God! -[gasps]
I'm so sorry.
Oh, God.
[in sing-song] Someone's getting fired.
If I had to wear that, I would pray to be fired.
Good one, Tina.
Let's go.
Oops.
Ooh.
♪ A touch of sable In their eyes ♪
Come on.
[Charlie] Hey, Uncle Hank.
Are you still working on that damn car?
You still working on that damn personality?
-What have you got for me? -Whatever you want.
Russians are gonna blow us all to hell anyway.
That's the spirit.
[Bill] Hey, kid.
Hand me the three-eighths, would you?
-You working on the carburetor? -[Bill] Mmm-hmm.
-You need the half-inch. -[Bill] I said the three...
-Thanks, kid. -Yep.
[Shatter] Where is Optimus Prime?
He survived the fall of Cybertron.
And no rebellion is truly dead
until the leader is vanquished.
So, where is he?
My name is Cliffjumper,
lieutenant in the Autobot resistance.
-My safe return will be considered... -[grunting]
[in sing-song] Wrong answer.
[Shatter] We know he's planning to establish a base.
Tell us where it is and we'll let you live.
My name is Cliffjumper, lieutenant... [grunts]
♪ Sometimes you wanna go... ♪
[Cliffjumper] No.
[Shatter] That's B-127's signal.
Can you trace it?
Already did.
If you won't tell us where Prime is, perhaps your young friend will.
Never.
You're a brave warrior.
You deserve a better death.
[scoffs] But then again...
Set course for Earth.
I'll give you thirty bucks for all of it.
[chuckles] I can get twice that much for the coil alone.
From who? I'm the only one that comes in here.
I don't even know how you're still open.
Just take it. Go. My show is on.
Hey, where did you get that Beetle?
I swear to God, ever since they put up that dumbass tower,
I can't get a signal to watch my shows.
I've got to see what happens to Alf this week.
[Charlie] Come on! -[metal clattering] -[Charlie sighs]
Are you kidding me?
Damn it.
I give up.
I can't do this without you. [sobbing]
[Alf on TV] Nice to meet you. Interested in a new Buick?
[Kate on TV] Nice try.
[Alf] All right, I touched. But I didn't eat.
[Kate] And I'm supposed to believe one of these steaks just got up and walked away on its own?
just got up and walked away on its own?
[Alf] I've seen stranger.
[Kate] No dinner for you tonight.
[Alf] But I'm starved!
I've been fasting since lunch!
[Alf] Well, I did eat that pumpkin.
[softly] Happy birthday.
I miss you, Dad.
I think it's too low, honey.
No. No, I think it goes to that button.
-Yeah? -Yeah.
I don't know about... Fix it.
Hey.
-Good morning, birthday girl! -Hi.
You look...
nice.
Happy birthday, baby.
I love you. Come on, open your present. I'm gonna be late for work.
Thanks, Mom.
Helmet. With...
daffodils.
So, I keep hearing about people on mopeds
getting run over and their brains smashed in.
You got to wear this from now on.
I don't care if it's not the law. It's our law.
Plus, look how cute it is.
Yeah.
[Sally] Happy birthday.
I actually got you a little gift, too, Charlie.
I mean, it's small, but, it's from the heart.
A smile is a powerful thing.
It releases endorphins.
It says to the world,
"I'm fun and approachable."
You know, there's a whole chapter in here
about how people who smile more often
actually have more friends.
That's unbelievable.
I really think it's gonna change your whole outlook if you smile more often.
I want the Beetle.
-What? -The yellow Beetle, I want it.
I'll make you a deal. If I get that thing started, it's mine.
That's no deal.
That's just you taking my car.
If I get it started, I keep it and I work here every day for a year!
I'll scrub the grease off the floors, okay?
I will pick up and organize every scrap of paper in this place.
I'll even detail your horrible, disgusting toilets.
Please. It's my birthday.
Sorry, no deal.
'Cause we ain't hiring.
It's yours, kid.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
And my toilets are gorgeous.
[Charlie] Oh, God, please.
Come on.
Oh, my...
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, thank you so much! I love you!
That thing ain't even safe to drive.
It's a deathtrap.
She's happy, though.
Man.
Looks amazing.
[whispers] What?
[whispers] Oh, my God.
[Sally] Charlie, what was that noise?
Nothing! I'm fine. Mom, you should go back to bed.
Everything's fine.
-What the hell is that? -Um, it's...
What is that car doing in our garage?
Car?
Oh, that, uh, car...
is my car.
Uncle Hank gave it to me.
-It runs. -[softly] Yeah.
Those aren't safe.
I wish you would've told me before you brought it home.
Okay. Sorry.
Um, I'm in the middle of some stuff, Mom.
Okay, I'll get out of your hair, but...
Tell me things sometime.
-I'm your mother. -Okay.
Okay.
Good night.
-It really runs? -Yeah, it really runs.
[Sally] Cool.
[Charlie] You still in there?
Okay.
A little jumpy. I'm sorry.
Okay.
Hi.
Oh, God, are you...
Do you speak?
I won't hurt you.
Can you understand me?
What are you?
Where did you come from?
Okay. It's okay.
You like my shirt?
You a metal fan?
No, wait...
Oh, who? Me?
Who am I?
Oh, I'm...
Charlie.
Charlie Watson.
I'm 18.
Today.
Actually, it's my birthday today.
What's your name?
You don't know or you don't have a name?
You sound like a little bumblebee.
I'm gonna call you that from now on.
Bumblebee.
Matches your outfit, too.
[Amber] I want a divorce, Roy!
-Come on, Amber. -Give me one good reason.
You tried to sleep with my sister!
Unsuccessfully!
Yeah, you're unsuccessful at everything.
That down payment was for a house. You bought a car.
How stupid are you, Roy? We don't need a car. God!
Now, just settle down for one second and hear me out.
-What the hell is that? -What?
Oh, God, Roy, that thing is coming right for us!
No, no, no, no, no...
Not my car. Not my car.
Please, God, no, not my car!
Oh, thank God, my car.
Yeah, I'm okay.
Oh, that's good, baby.
That's good.
[both] Run. Run!
[Roy] Oh...
-God! -[engine revving]
Is that my car?
Hello...
[Roy] Jeez!
[Shatter] Earth.
-[Amber] Roy! -[Roy] Oh!
How underwhelming.
The indigenous life is even more primitive than I expected.
Hey...
Hmm. I like the way they pop.
Focus, comrade.
B-127's distress signal came from the western coast of this continent.
For now, we head west.
[Ron] When do they start letting you use nunchucks?
[Otis] I don't know, but I hope soon.
-Morning! See you guys later. -Where you off to so fast?
Nowhere. Have a nice day.
Morning, Bum--...
Bee?
Bee, where are you?
-Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. -[car door closes]
-Bee! -[engine starts]
Where did you go?
Otis!
[panting] Have you seen my car?
Unfortunately, yes.
No, have you seen my car today?
It was in the garage. Someone stole it!
No, idiot. Mom took it.
-[panting] -She had to bring Conan to the vet
because he swallowed, like, a rubber glove or something
and Ron needed the station wagon.
Thank God.
Wait.
Hi. Excuse me. It's me again.
-We never officially met, but... -I can't right now. Sorry.
Nope. Yep.
[stutters] Okay.
I know, buddy. Hang in there.
You can't eat everything you see.
Just let this be a good life lesson for you.
Oh, my God. Stop it! Don't do that!
Bee, no!
-Mom? -Whoa!
Jesus! Charlie, what are you doing?
Mom, you gotta pull over.
-What the hell is going on? -Just pull the car over.
[Sally] Okay, okay. All right.
Would you put that robot junk away?
What are you thinking?
[Sally] You almost gave me a heart attack.
I thought I was being carjacked. I'm taking the dog to the vet.
I can't believe you would take him without me.
Mom, I'm so worried about him!
He's my dog, too, you know.
What happened to Conan being Otis's dog?
[sighs] Mom, you're being hysterical, okay?
You should not be driving in such an emotional state.
I know how you get during emergencies.
I'm a nurse.
Not of animals.
Oh, okay. I'm happy for you to drive.
You weren't wearing your helmet, by the way.
-I saw that. -Oh, shoot.
[whispers] Keep it together, Bee.
Sir?
Sir.
I thought you'd want to see this immediately.
-They sure? -[Simmons] Yes, sir.
Two of them just made contact in Texas.
Intel says they're heading west fast.
Saddle up, Simmons.
We're going to Texas.
[Charlie] Okay, Bee, we need to go over a few things.
Okay. We're all clear.
All right. [spits] I'm re-thinking the beach.
Oh, I'm good.
No, I'm good, thanks.
People can be terrible about things they don't understand.
If they find you, they'll probably lock you up in a lab somewhere
and cut you into tiny little pieces.
It'll be... bad, trust me.
The only person you can show yourself around is me, okay?
So, let's practice. You ready?
If you see anyone besides me, what do you do?
Great. Perfect. [chuckles] Come back now.
Okay, so let's say we're driving and all of a sudden...
Oh, shoot! Somebody's here! Hide, Bee, hide!
You serious?
Bee, it's too late. You're already dead.
It's all right.
That's why we're practicing.
You'll get it.
[pilot] Fox-2 on approach. Non-biologicals are inbound.
The goal, sir, should be to communicate with them.
First contact with an alien species.
I've spent my whole life waiting for this moment.
If they make one wrong move,
we put 'em down.
The humans are multiplying.
Please let me kill them.
Not yet.
B-127's signal has gone silent.
I have an idea.
Listen up! I'm Agent Burns
and this is... Dr. Powell.
We currently have 100 guns pointed right at your head!
So, state your business.
[Shatter] People of Earth,
we are Decepticon peacekeepers patrolling the galaxy.
[Dropkick] What are you doing?
This is humiliating.
We believe a dangerous criminal from our world
is hiding somewhere on yours.
How is it you think we can help?
We need your eyes.
Wait.
You want access to our satellites?
[Shatter] Our scanners' range is limited.
Your infrastructure is... primitive.
But combined, they could be quite powerful.
No way! Out of the question!
We have a common enemy, Agent Burns.
There's a war raging on our planet.
If B-127 isn't found, that war may find its way here.
Perhaps...
We can find a way to help one another.
We'll talk it over with our superiors.
In the meantime,
if you could follow us.
Very well, friend Powell.
Take us to your leader.
[Charlie] Must suck being cooped up in a VW all day, huh?
Is there anyone that can help you?
Do you have a family?
You know, like a mom, dad, siblings?
You all love each other?
Or drive each other crazy
and you can't wait to get away and start a whole new life.
Do you want me to see if I can fix it?
I'll be gentle, I promise.
[softly] Whoa.
You lay down, okay?
Hold still.
I think maybe there's something...
[Optimus distorted] B-127,
I pray this message finds you.
-Our war rages on. -[transmission breaking]
...planet Earth...
...survival...
[Decepticon] Ravage, eject!
[Optimus distorted] ...your mission...
...soldier... I...
Are you okay?
Who was that?
That voice said something about a-- a war.
Do you remember anything?
Is the VW Beetle some kind off... disguise?
Are you hiding from something?
Are you scared?
[Charlie] It's broken.
It's okay.
I think I can help.
Let's go home.
[Allison on TV] ...and a basket case,
[Claire] ...a princess...
-[John] And a criminal. -[Charlie] All right, I'm almost done.
[Brian on TV] Does that answer your question?
[Charlie] No way. Are you actually watching it? ♪ Don't you forget about me ♪
You can pop in another one if you want.
[Charlie's dad on tape] Whoo! Come on, sweetie!
You got this, Charlie girl!
All right, Charlie girl!
Hello, Brighton Falls.
This is Charlie Watson, future Olympic gold medalist.
[laughs] That was so perfect.
-Thanks, Dad. -[Charlie's dad] How do you feel?
[Charlie] No, no, why would you play this?
Sorry. I just...
I finished.
Let's see if we got something.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Oh, my God, yes!
It worked!
Look at you go.
You got some moves.

Hey, hey, please don't touch those. Please.
They belonged to my dad.
Do you want to hear it?
We used to listen to this while we'd work on the Corvette.
It was his favorite.
He used to say it would make the car feel better.
We used to work on this car every weekend together. ♪ And time can do so much ♪
It was our thing.
That tape...
That was the last time I saw him.
He died of a heart attack.
I never got to say goodbye.
You know, I always thought if I could just...
finish fixing this car...
If I could just get it to start up again,
he would hear me.
He would hear me.
I say this with all due respect.
Have you lost your damn mind?
That was with all due respect?
[General Whalen] The man's got a point, Doctor.
Our satellite network is at the forefront of our national defense.
[Powell] Sir, please.
It could be a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Can you imagine the advances an alliance with these creatures might bring?
[Agent Burns] I imagine the advances.
An advance on Washington.
-New York. An advance on Chicago! -That's not gonna happen.
They literally call themselves "Decepticons."
That doesn't set off any red flags?
Enough! From both of you.
[Dr. Powell] Sir,
we're talking about the most advanced robotic system ever seen.
If we tell them no,
they'll just take their technology to the Russians instead.
Do you really want to go down in history as the man who cost us the Cold War?
Fine.
We'll help them find their fugitive.
And when it's done,
you can do all the experiments you want. Hmm?
Yes, sir.
[Dr. Powell] Gentle... uh, robots.
Welcome to Sector 7.
[Dropkick] How kind of you to finally allow us in.
We're very happy to have you here as friends.
Thank you, friend Powell.
My superior has agreed to grant you limited access to our satellites.
In addition, you're welcome to use
all of our technology here.
It's the largest super-array of Crays on Earth.
We thank you for your hospitality.
Tell me, those vocal communication devices you use,
do they function worldwide?
The telephones? Yes, why?
You got to pick a station, man.
I know there's a lot of choices.
"You want to go on a date with me, maybe?"
Okay, uh...

Here we go. Here we go.

Excuse me. Sorry to barge in. I just...

[Charlie] No, no, it's fine! Just...
Just sit down, please? Shh, don't scream, okay?
-What is that? -[Charlie shushing]
It's okay, okay? Just breathe. Breathe.
-First of all, hi. -Hi.
I'm Charlie.
I'm Memo, hi. Hi, Memo. Um...
It's nice to meet you.
Pleasure... Pleasure... [grunts]
Look, I know what you saw was a little crazy. I can explain.
Yeah, I can't explain. But here's the deal.
If you tell anyone what you just saw,
I'm gonna have to run you over with my car.
Jeez.
That was... I don't mean that in a mean way.
Okay? What I'm saying
is no one can know what you just saw, okay?
You promise?
Yeah.
Okay.
[whispers] Okay.
Bumblebee, you can... you can come out now.
What? [chuckles nervously]
It's, uh...
He.
Wow.
He's been going up and down on that dial all day today and I don't know why.
-Hey, check out his reflexes. -What?
-Oh! Oh, God! [whimpers] -[Charlie chuckles]
-Yo, give me your shirt. -Huh? Give me your shirt.
You mean the shirt that I'm wearing?
Yes, yes! Come on. I'll give it back to you.
Okay.
Come on! Give me your shirt!
All right.
Wait, wait, wait! Hey, no, no! You don't need to do this.
-Yes, I do. -[stammering] No, but...
-Come here. Come on! -No, I get it. I get it!
Sorry.
I know I promised you, but, yeah, you're not getting that back.
[Dr. Powell] It's incredible!
They're combining our technology seamlessly.
Satellites, phones, computers.
They're creating an interconnected web of information.
Volumes of data at their fingertips.
It's revolutionary.
He's a weird guy. You ever notice that about Powell?
[Dr. Powell] They're tracking fluctuations in Energon levels.
It's like a heat signature specific to their species.
It's astonishing.
It's beautiful. It's...
Hello? Hello?
You've given them our satellites, our comms, God knows what else.
Yet, in the space of a day they've given us a way
to not only hunt down B-127,
but all of them.
Let them finish what they're doing. Let them find B-127.
And then I'll give you permission to destroy them all.
Use them for spare parts.
Sir, yes, sir.
[Memo] So you have no idea where he came from?
[Charlie] No idea.
You thought about calling the cops?
What are they gonna do, Memo?
They're just gonna send him away to a lab
and do weird science experiments on him.

Morning, buddy. I got to go to work, okay?
Bee. Listen to me. You need to stay in this garage, okay?
After what happened last night,
I'm pretty sure the cops are looking for you,
and, uh, you don't exactly blend in.
I'll be back, all right?
Here.
You can have my Pop-Tart.
I need you to go to the frozen banana stand
and steal some sticks.
We're out of sticks.
Can't we just sell the hot dogs without the sticks?
No.
What's happening here?
We got a hit, I think. Where's that location?
Near San Francisco. A coastal town named Brighton Falls.
You have a personal call.
-Hello? -Charlie, hey, it's Memo.
You got to come home right now.
It's bad. It's really, really bad.
Where's Bumblebee?
Bumblebee, what have you done?
What were you thinking? What...
I told you to hide in the garage!
Great.
Helpful shame spiral, Bee.
I'm not mad, okay?
This is all my fault.
I never should have left you.
[Memo] Hey, okay, maybe don't transform all the way?
We've still got to get you through the door.
Come on, buddy.
It's okay.
I am so screwed.
And now you're crippled for life.
Honey, watch the hair.
Go. Now. But be quiet.
Mom, wait!
Oh, my God!
-Mom... -[Sally] What happened?
[Charlie] I'm sorry. This is all my fault.
What'd you do to my TV?
Look, Mom, I can explain.
We will talk about this later, all right?
-Now, I have to go. -Are you kidding me?
No. You're not going anywhere.
It's about my car. It's really important.
About your car?
That you spend all day and night shut in that garage,
doing God-knows-what with?
Mom, I can't. I really can't right now.
Oh, no, you really can, Charlie.
You really can.
I have had it!
Your attitude, your always sulking around.
You brought home that piece of crap without even asking me!
Everyone in this family is trying to be happy,
and all you want to do is make things harder.
You know, Mom, just because you've moved on
and you're happy with your new life doesn't mean I have!
You've found a replacement for my dad and I haven't,
You've found a replacement for my dad and I haven't, okay, and I never will!
So, I'm sorry if that makes things harder,
but in ten months from now you won't even have to deal with me!
Charlie!
Hey, you okay?
Yeah.
I just feel like ever since my dad died,
I've become this drain on everyone, and I hate it.
It's like everybody expects me to act like nothing ever happened, and...
it's impossible to do that.
About your dad...
I'm really sorry.
Thanks.
You know, there's...
there's this quote that I like.
"The darkest nights produce the brightest stars."
That's nice.
My mom got it from Weight Watchers.
Get out and move away from the vehicle.
Stay cool, Bee.
What's going on?
Hey!
-Come on! -[Charlie] Stop it!
Let go of me!
-Weapons now! Take it down! -Run!
No, don't run. Do not run!
She ran.
Please tell me they're on our side.
[Shatter] No more running.
No more hiding.
B-127, you're a traitor and a coward.
Tell us where Optimus Prime is hiding.

Stop! Stop it!
[Agent Burns] Your daughter stole government property, Mrs. Watson.
[Sally] She's been having trouble adjusting,
but we had no idea it was this serious.
I...
Charlie. Honey.
I didn't steal anything, and he doesn't belong to them.
-"He?" -[Agent Burns] Ma'am. I can assure you that it is an "it".
I can assure you that it is an "it".
And "it" is a highly dangerous war machine.
No, he isn't, okay, Mom?
He's not some "war machine."

He's my friend.
Ma'am, your daughter's had a traumatic experience today.
Maybe doesn't understand everything she's seen.
She's disoriented.
No, I'm fine, Mom. I'm completely fine, okay?
You have to believe me, please. I didn't steal anything!
Stop! Just go to your room.
When I was going through puberty,
I stole things, too.
-Stole a box of Mallomars once. -Yeah, we know.
[Otis] Boom.
Caught you.
Oh, Mom's gonna love this.
Look, Otis, you need to go home and...
Mom!
No, Otis, stop it!
-Why would you do that? -[grunting]
Let go of me!
-You're touching my buttocks! -[shushes]
I will tell you a secret if you shut up.
Okay, so, um, this is my room.
Just make yourself at home.
These are actually my sister's stuff.
She likes playing pranks, like putting her stuff over here.
-[Charlie] Can I, uh, sit down? -Yeah, yeah. Mmm-hmm.
[reporter on TV] Residents of Brighton Falls
have been witness to an unusual sight this evening.
Armed Forces pouring into town as part of what we are told
is a routine military exercise
setting up camp at our own McKinnon Air Base.
If Bumblebee's still alive, that's where they're keeping him.
We have to go. We have to try and save him.
Count me in. I'll take point.
-No, you won't. -Come on.
No, Otis.
-But I can help. Master Larry says I-- -I need someone here.
I need someone reliable
to make sure that Mom and Ron don't know that I'm gone.
I'm someone reliable.
Hell, yeah, you are.
Good luck.
You, too.
Get over here.
Oh.
Let's do this.
[Shatter] Tell us where Optimus Prime and the rebels are hiding,
and we can end this war.
Talk!
[Dr. Powell] Who is Optimus Prime?
[Shatter] This doesn't concern you, human Powell.
Last chance.
[Memo] Are you sure this is a good idea?
[Charlie] It's a terrible idea, but I've got to try it.
[Memo] You can't get-- Well, why don't you-- Stop, stop, wait...
-How'd you know the power was off? -[Charlie] I didn't. Let's go.
[Dropkick] Can I?
[Shatter] His Memory cells are fried.
Finish him.
[Optimus] We will fight on.
Regroup, rebuild, and retake our home.
But we must find refuge first.
You will travel to Earth.
Once we've gathered the others, we'll join you.
You must protect the planet.
If the Decepticons find it,
then our people are truly finished.
Stay safe, soldier.
I am coming.
Prime is coming here?
They're all coming here.
This is our chance to wipe out the Autobot resistance for good.
We'll burn the whole planet to cinders.
[Shatter] We must get word to Cybertron immediately.
[on radio] This is Burns.
Tell them to bring an army.
[softly] Burns, we made a terrible mistake.
Powell?
And thanks to our human allies,
I know just how to get the message home.
They're using our satellites.
They're calling an army.
They're gonna kill us all.
Thank you for your hospitality, friend Powell.
He's all yours.
-No. -[Agent Burns] Powell?

And so do I.
I gotta let you go.
[man 1 on radio] Thank you...
[woman on radio] So much...
[man 2 on radio] For giving me...
[man 3 on radio] My voice.
Thank you for...
for making me feel like me again.
I'll never forget you.
Goodbye, Bumblebee.
No way.
You kidding me?
Are you telling me you could've been a Camaro this whole time?
-Oh, my God! -[engine revs]

Baby. [kisses]
Thank God you're all right.
Thanks for coming, Mom.
That was some driving, Ron.
Well, I've taken a few notes.
Otis.
They forced me to tell.
I'm glad they did.
I couldn't have done it without you guys.
[Memo] Hey, Charlie.
I'll be right back, okay? [chuckles]
Wow, um, what happened to you today?
Oh, this?
Oh, you know, robot fights,
high-speed chases, international disasters.
The usual.
-Right. -Yeah.
Yeah, hmm...
-Not quite there yet. -Nope.
-Yep. Okay, okay. -No. Yeah.
[Optimus] Old friend, you kept this planet safe.
Because of you,
we have a future, B-127.
[man 1 on radio] My name...
[man 2] Is...
[Charlie] Bumblebee.
From what I recall, it goes something like this...
Before history began,
Egypt was the birthplace of all life.
A paradise worthy of the gods who created it.
So the gods decided to live there
alongside their lesser creation, man.
But there was no mistaking the gods amongst the mortals who worshipped them.
The gods were taller with gold running through their veins instead of blood.
And they could transform at will into all manner of frightening beasts.
Egypt itself was divided between two mighty brothers.
Osiris, the God of Life, was the beloved king of all the lands made bountiful by the Nile.
of all the lands made bountiful by the Nile.
His brother, Set, ruled the far barren desert
finding both strength and bitterness in his isolation.
But then the time came for Osiris to crown a new king.
His only son, Horus.
It was a decision that would test the brothers' bond
and the fate of all Egypt.
But the gods are only half our tale.
It had become clear that they couldn't shape the course of destiny alone.
A man of exceptional judgment, wisdom and fortitude would be needed.
Unfortunately, I was not such a man.
But before you dismiss my younger foolhardy self, remember...
remember...
Never doubt a man fighting for the one thing as powerful as any god.
fighting for the one thing as powerful as any god. MAN: Three hundred, impossible.
OLDER BEK: Love.
(GRUNTS) Thief! (GRUNTING)
MAN: Stop!
ZAYA: (SIGHS) This dress is hopeless.
I need to buy some ribbon to even begin to make it suitable for the coronation.
I say we spend tomorrow together instead.
We are spending tomorrow together. At the coronation.
We're blessed the gods shall give us a new king in our lifetime. Horus?
Horus?
You know I couldn't care less about the gods.
Well, they care about you.
Oh, yeah? Bek! Give it back.
I knew you wanted to wear something special.
Did you steal it from a shopkeeper or from someone's closet?
It was quicker than waiting for the gods to answer my prayers.
The gods give us everything we need.
Yes. Their generosity knows no bounds.
(SIGHS) You look beautiful.
Zaya, when I asked you to run away with me,
I promised you a good life.
Dresses worthy of a princess. A new one every day. (CHUCKLES)
Rivers of jewels to adorn you.
A golden palace to raise our family.
And how many children would we have?
(SOFTLY) A dozen.
I would do anything to make you happy.
OLDER BEK: And how was Horus, the king-to-be, preparing for his great day? (SNORING)
Lord of the Air.
Quite an occasion last night.
Already crowds press cheek-to-cheek to catch a glimpse of you.
SERVANT 2: You will look splendid. (GRUNTING SOFTLY)
Eventually. (GIGGLING)
SERVANTS: ♪ Glorious, glorious Horus! ♪
OLDER BEK: But don't discount Horus yet either.
Because when it comes to the fate of the world in one's hands,
even gods can be surprised by the strength they possess. (SIGHS)
If I was to be crowned,
I might have spent the preceding hours composing a message for my people.
Could the people love him more?
Maybe Lord Horus doesn't think we need boring speeches.
Except when it comes to toasting his own glory.
Many toasts were required.
I was doing deeds of which songs will be sung.
The great lion he slayed was terrorizing villages.
It was? Good. All the more song-worthy. (SIGHS)
That's nice.
(STUTTERS) That's fine, thank...
You.
A shame I've come too late.
But here I am, sober and clothed.
Don't tell anyone.
I have a bad reputation to keep.
(SOFTLY) Come here. Come.
No. No, no. No, no! (SCREAMS)
HATHOR: Hard to believe, but you look like a king.
If that's what excites you, who am I to judge?
Jewelry excites me.
Then look to your wrist, if the effort is not too great. The Bracelet of 42 Stars.
The Bracelet of 42 Stars. To remind you of the demons I slayed for you.
To remind you of the demons I slayed for you.
A more valuable treasure Egypt has never known. This old thing?
This old thing?
How can the Goddess of Love not know what love is?
It's not bedding any girl who flutters her eyelashes,
mighty lion-slayer.
I was celebrating the hunt. You would know that had you been here.
I value my freedom. Dead animals less so.
Well, you have no problem wearing them.
Oh... Hathor, don't. Don't.
That's no way for a queen to behave.
Then it's a good thing I'm not a queen.
Can you imagine anything more dull than sitting on a throne all day?
What exactly are you asking me?
Did I ask you something?
I'm not sure. Did you?
SERVANT: My Lord. It's starting.
Hathor, Goddess of Love! (CROWD APPLAUDING)
Nephthys, Goddess of Protection!
Sir. Oh...
Thank you, young man.
You've been awfully nice to strangers today. Show me your hands.
What? Gifts for Osiris.
ZAYA: Hurry up!
Thoth, God of Wisdom!
Greetings, Thoth.
Did you ever imagine that your former student
would one day wear the crown of Egypt?
Horus evinced a range of attributes,
some of which may well correlate with a leadership position.
If he's lucky.
Praise Osiris! (CROWD CHEERING) King of all Egypt!
Hail Ra, Lord of Light.
ALL: Hail Ra, Lord of Light!
My father has seen fit to bless this day
as you all bless us with your generosity.
A token from someone with much. And from someone with little.
But when both die and stand at the Final Gate,
what is their value then?
I say they are equal.
Symbols of lives well-lived.
All are welcome to the Afterlife.
This is my legacy.
But today, we crown a new king.
And one day, he will have a legacy of his own.
My son Horus, Lord of the Air. (CROWD ROARING AND APPLAUDING)
(WHISPERING) Are you ready?
I am.
SET: Wait! Wait.
Sorry I'm late.
Ugh, three days to cross the desert.
And nearly one more to pass through all your admirers. (CROWD LAUGHING)
Set!
Brother. Good to see you.
And you, brother.
There's always a place for you here.
Such a big day for the family. You must be proud.
I am.
Look at you, nephew. Magnificent.
At least someone here'll make a fine king. I was afraid you wouldn't come.
I was afraid you wouldn't come.
No, I wouldn't miss it. Ah.
For you. Oh...
A hunting horn.
From the skull of a ram that flattened 10 gods slower than me.
It's beautiful.
Yeah? Try it out.
From Set. (CROWD CHEERING)
Come on! Let Ra himself hear you.
I think someone heard you. (FOOTSTEPS MARCHING)
What is this, Set?
You recognize it?
Father gave it to you.
Kept me alive for many a night in the desert.
Fight me.
Father, don't. Stay out of this, son.
Why?
In 1,000 years of peace, what have you accomplished?
A land of people who dream of nothing more.
It's my turn now.
I won't fight.
I love you, brother. With all my heart.
CROWD: No! (ISIS GASPS)
I love you, too, brother.
No!
ISIS: Osiris!
Well, this truly is a big day for the family.
I, Set, shall be your one true king.
King of all Egypt!
Behold the fate of those who stand in my way.
Gods... Bow before me or die.
Mortals, worship me or be enslaved!
(SOFTLY) Bek!
(SOFTLY) Bek! My brother thought the Afterlife was a gift.
I think a king should have higher standards.
From now on, you have to buy your way in with riches earned.
Your journey has just begun.
It's yours now.
Many of us will stand with you, but now is not the time.
-I looked up to you. -Of course you did.
(GRUNTING)
That would be unwise.
Is it true you still never miss? Doesn't that get dull?
Doesn't that get dull?
I thought your sight was perfect.
You fight well.
Are you so sure you're his son?
Zaya!
Bek! Zaya!
Bek! (GRUNTS)
I'm doing Egypt a favor. You're not fit to be King.
(SCREAMING) No! No!
Set!
(SOFTLY) Forgive me, Father.
BEK: Zaya! Zaya!
OLDER BEK: And so Set was King.
In the year that followed, many gods stood against him.
One by one, they paid with their lives.
For mortals, things were worse.
Most were forced into slavery,
and denied even the tiniest penny to buy our way into the Afterlife.
Blinded and defeated, Horus withdrew into exile.
Those who prayed for him to save Egypt were sorely disappointed.
But I was never much for prayer.
I had found Zaya enslaved to a cruel master.
But how could I free her from all this?
It was the maddest of all plans.
You may not control the wind, Zaya, but I'd think you could close a shutter.
Sorry, My Lord.
Pretty one, if ever I find my desk disordered again,
I'll throw you outside to push stone. Is that clear?
URSHU: Come on, come on! Haven't got all day.
I'd like to drop him from a great height. (CHUCKLES)
Morning. (CHUCKLES)
(WHIPLASH) (URSHU URGING)
One day, I'm going to steal you away from him.
ZAYA: Is theft always the answer?
It is now in this world. You're either rich or nothing. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Even if you could free me,
what about my family? Our friends?
Can you steal all Egypt away from Set? (SCOFFS) Only Horus can free us.
(SCOFFS) Only Horus can free us. You really believe the gods care?
You really believe the gods care?
If Horus could come, he would.
I want to show you something.
ZAYA: Set's army returns with spoils of war.
His vault will be unlocked tonight. The perfect time
The perfect time for someone to sneak inside. Why?
Why?
They say Horus' eyes are kept there.
He would have his power again. Steal from a god?
Steal from a god? Only a madman would try such a thing.
Where do you suppose we could find someone so mad?
The plans should be here.
Urshu built the vault. He's Set's architect.
What's this?
Uh, Set's pyramid of sand.
BEK: He's built himself quite the fire pit. He must cook massive feasts.
He must cook massive feasts.
It's the pit to the center of the world. The source of his power. No feasts.
The source of his power. No feasts.
Found it.
The treasure will pass through the front gate.
The front gate isn't the problem. It's what comes after.
Two bridges rigged with traps.
Urshu boasts of them endlessly.
Good thing I'm cheating.
Welcome me properly, soldier.
Don't keep the Queen of Egypt waiting.
SET: I think you missed me. (CHUCKLES)
I have to miss you. I'm your prisoner, after all.
Oh, this prison's not so bad. Well, I'm miserable.
Well, I'm miserable.
You have a funny way of showing it. Can I borrow your knife?
Can I borrow your knife?
So if you had the chance, you'd kill me?
How could I kill you?
But you would if you could.
(WHISPERING) Better keep your eyes open.
Lord Set.
And, uh... Mistress.
Perhaps I might come at a better time. SET: No, come in. Don't be shy.
SET: No, come in. Don't be shy. (SET EXHALES)
Come on.
No one has ever so honored the great God Ra.
He will pass over its peak and marvel at the tribute you have built in his name.
at the tribute you have built in his name.
Is that it?
I'm sorry?
Well, can you make it any taller?
Taller?
Yes, it's a simple question.
(STUTTERS) Well, that might be difficult, um, now, I mean...
Relax, Urshu. I'm joking.
Tell me, why'd your father choose you to be master builder rather than one of your brothers?
rather than one of your brothers?
I suppose because I proved to be the best, My Lord. As I shall prove to be the best to my father.
As I shall prove to be the best to my father.
He shall see it from dawn to dusk.
Your satisfaction is worth more than gold.
Oh, gold, gold!
You'll have plenty enough gold for the Afterlife. A toast!
To Egypt's greatest builder.
A toast to my legacy.
Where do you even get that many scorpions?
Enough to make you afraid of your own shadow.
"The circle is the trigger."
So I'll go 'round.
Well, that was easy.
A third bridge.
Doesn't say anything about a third bridge.
This is criminal.
And only one eye.
Terrific.
Zaya, you'd say a prayer, I'll roll the bones.
Zaya!
(WHISPERING) I'm so sorry.
As if using my house for your fornicating were not sufficient...
You dare steal from the King?
I pride myself in an orderly office, Zaya.
You never did understand that, did you?
Oh, and this pathetic little trinket of yours will save neither of you, I'm afraid. (SOFTLY) Set is your god.
(SOFTLY) Set is your god.
-It was all my idea. -Liar!
Give me back what you took.
Thank you.
-Feed them to the jackals. -Wait!
I took something else. (URSHU SCREAMS)
Run! (GRUNTS)
(URGING) (HORSE WHINNIES)
(CHUCKLES) You did it. Where's the other?
You know how hard it was to steal that one? (BOTH LAUGH)
I'll love you forever. Zaya.
Zaya.
Death is not the end. Zaya.
I'll make it right, Zaya.
HORUS: I don't need any more worshippers.
Tributes that rot and stink.
Unless you brought more wine, get out.
I'm no worshipper.
What are you? Some thief?
Yes. A thief.
I have something Set took from you.
No mortal could rob Set's vault.
You pilfered one of my followers' corpses.
They never even got close.
Give them to me.
Not yet.
Give me my eyes. I have a proposition.
I have a proposition. You bargain with me?
You bargain with me? (GRUNTING)
You're lucky I'm willing to.
You can't strike a three-legged elephant.
You want a reward, I suppose? Gold?
Gold I can steal. (GRUNTS)
There's someone I want saved.
From what?
Death. (SCOFFS)
Didn't your father teach that death isn't the end? It can't be done.
It can't be done.
Well, figure it out. You're Horus, Lord of the Air!
Or maybe I'll just toss what I have in the Nile.
Wait.
HORUS: Stay with the living. Stay with the living. Stay with the living.
-She's gone beyond where I can reach her. -But you're a god.
Gods may live 1,000 of your years, but we cannot cure mortality.
but we cannot cure mortality.
It's time for her to walk the path.
There must be something you can do.
I've done all I can.
Oh, thou who art everlasting,
send your servant to guide the dead to new life.
Anubis, come forth. (WIND HOWLING)
You are released.
The doors of Earth are open to you. You must begin your journey. She died a slave.
She died a slave. Without treasure, she won't be allowed
Without treasure, she won't be allowed through the Final Gate.
What do you offer?
She can't pass into the Afterlife.
For you, Lord Anubis, Governor of the Bows, who is upon his mountain,
I have only my smile.
So be it.
BEK: Zaya! Zaya!
The dead don't speak to the living.
Stay on the path.
HORUS: Now give them to me.
-You've done nothing! -My eyes.
Spend the rest of your days wandering around sightless.
I have nothing to lose. Do you understand? Give me my eyes.
Give me my eyes. I will do anything to see her again or I'll die trying.
You want to hide from me? Learn to talk less.
Here. (GRUNTS)
Where's the other?
(STUTTERS)
Where's the other?
Well, I'm not exactly sure, but I... I'll snap your neck.
I'll snap your neck. (CHOKING)
(CHOKING) You must hate Set for what he did to your father.
The pyramid. I know how to get into Set's pyramid.
How? How?
It's where he keeps his power locked up, right?
If I could get you inside, could you kill him? (BEK GRUNTS)
How would you do that?
I saw the plans. Tell me.
Tell me.
-I'll show you. -Go on.
If you bring Zaya back.
There may be a way.
HORUS: No one may leave the Afterlife once entered.
But the journey through the Nine Gates will take several days to complete.
And only the King can make Anubis turn back.
If I kill Set and take back the crown
If I kill Set and take back the crown before your beloved reaches the Final Gate,
I might be able to save her.
Try to keep up.
SET: My magnificent bloody hounds. (SOLDIERS CHEERING)
You are the true sons of Egypt.
You are my children of iron and blood.
No father could be more proud.
The rebel gods have choked on our spears.
The rest have retreated to Nephthys' stronghold
where they now stand ready to face us.
But you, my legions of the desert, will bring them reckoning! (CHEERING)
So take your fill of gold! (GRUNTS)
And if you should fall in battle and travel the Nine Gates,
tell my brother who it is you worship! GENERAL: Division Set! Amarn! Ta! Rai!
GENERAL: Division Set! Amarn! Ta! Rai! Fall in!
Forward march!
My Lord.
Your royal treasury has been breached.
SET: Urshu... Wasn't the eye meant to lure those loyal to Horus to their deaths?
Wasn't the eye meant to lure those loyal to Horus to their deaths?
Yes, Lord. (MNEVIS GRUNTS)
And weren't your traps...
What was the term you used?
Thief-proof?
Yes, Lord.
Can you pick up the trail? I'll find him.
I'll find him.
And find whichever of his allies was clever enough to steal back his eye.
was clever enough to steal back his eye.
It was a mortal, Lord.
A mortal? (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Who is she?
His servant. In my defense, Lord...
In my defense, Lord...
Believe me, I'm very curious to hear what your excuse is.
But not right now. Yes, Lord.
Yes, Lord.
Well, it appears you're not the cleverest mortal in Egypt after all.
This thief is.
BEK: So what is your plan?
HORUS: To kill the God of the Desert, we must kill the desert itself.
Kill the desert? How do you kill the desert?
We must go to my grandfather's. He'll help us with our task.
Your grandfather? You mean Ra? The Sun God Ra?
So where exactly is your grandfather?
You're being funny, right?
You think I'd put any effort into trying to amuse you?
It seems flying would be useful right now.
Without both my eyes, I cannot transform.
I need to pray for strength.
Oh, that's not encouraging.
Be silent or you'll reach the bottom of this mountain
Be silent or you'll reach the bottom of this mountain much quicker than you reached the top.
Great Ra, know my name. The Lord of the Air seeks your embrace.
(WHISPERS) Grandfather, I need your help. Please!
Impressed!
HORUS: Stay in my shadow.
-Why? -Just do as I say.
-Why? -Just do as I say. (SKIN SIZZLES) (GROANS)
HORUS: Hail, thou Great God Ra.
Normally, when a bird lands on my boat, I kill it before it can shit.
What is this? You dare bring a mortal to the source of Creation?
He's valuable to me. I could not leave him behind.
Ah. Why have you come?
I would only ask something of you.
Oh, in that case, I shall stop what I'm doing and heed your bidding.
Grandfather, I'm sorry. I mean no disrespect.
You don't know the difference. (HOWLING IN THE DISTANCE)
Stay there. Be quiet.
I have work to do.
And put the mortal below deck if you want him to live.
Crawl back to shadow, you stinking worm!
You shall never feast on my creation!
Try as you might.
Things would be different if I could dwell amongst my children in the garden of the Nile.
amongst my children in the garden of the Nile.
It is my burden to fight the demon Apophis night after night.
Egypt must never be destroyed by Chaos.
So, you see, there are things worse than Set.
You're wrong.
That demon isn't the one who murdered my father. Murdered your son. They are both my sons.
They are both my sons.
They were both equal in my eyes.
As is all of my creation.
And the uncertainty of its destiny is my will.
So what is it actually that brings you here?
Allow me to fill my flask with these waters.
The waters are not mine.
You plan to quench the desert fire.
To kill Set. To become King as your father wished.
Grant me the power to fly again.
I heard your prayer the first time.
I let you come here and I grant you passage home. But after that?
But after that?
Without both my eyes, I doubt I'm strong enough to beat Set.
So become stronger.
Have you been so lazy for so long
that you've forgotten every god's life is a journey?
When you stray from your path, you grow weak. (POUNDING) BEK: Hey!
Why are you lugging around this mortal?
He had the gall to strike a bargain with me. Ah.
Not worth the papyrus it's written on, hmm?
(SIGHS) What does it matter? He is but a mortal.
I do not approve of how Set rules.
But I'm uncertain you would be much better.
GENERAL: Lord, the last of the rebel gods have retreated behind her walls.
Every last one?
Yes, sir.
Good. Then they're ripe for the picking.
Isn't this a bit excessive?
She'd want them to fight to the death anyway.
She was your wife.
All the more reason to kill her.
From now on, this will be the way of things. Our way.
Better get used to it. (EXHALES THROUGH TEETH)
Is it right that a goddess should perform such labor?
Since you became King,
the need for burial shrouds has been great.
You could have been a queen.
NEPHTHYS: You should know why I could not.
SET: Then, when I asked you to marry me, why did you say yes?
I remember when you rode out of the desert.
Impetuous. Dashing. So handsome.
I braved those stinging winds just to be at your side.
And imagined the great deeds we would accomplish together.
It didn't all sting. Some parts were sweet.
NEPHTHYS: Perhaps. I still thought we could have been happy.
I should have been enough to fulfill you. (EXHALES)
Nothing can fulfill me.
That's why Ra was wise to ensure you would never have a child.
Why?
No one will know, until it's too late. (NEPHTHYS SCREAMS)
Maybe next time, keep flying until we're actually on the ground.
What Ra gave, he took back. (BOTH GROAN)
I thought he was helping you. I got what I needed.
I got what I needed.
The whole of the Nile cannot quench Set's fire.
But a few drops from the water of Creation can.
Kill the desert.
With his fire gone, Set will be weakened. Vulnerable.
What would happen if I drank that?
You would be refreshed. Then you would die.
It doesn't seem right that the water of Creation would kill.
I would kill you. For wasting my water.
What's this?
So you don't have to bring me something to drink cupped in your hands.
I'm not your slave.
My father taught me it's unworthy of a god to strike a man.
He should have taught you to get off your arse and get your own water.
Sorry, Father.
This is becoming unacceptable.
Where is the Eye of Horus?
Up your behind, alongside the goats you keep up there.
Where is the Eye of Horus?
Right here. (SCOFFS)
MNEVIS: I thought you were crawling sightless in the mud somewhere.
Cut him down! (GRUNTING)
MNEVIS: See, brothers? Without his other eye, he is weak. (GROWLING) (GRUNTS)
Even if I were blind, deaf, bereft of limbs...
You're still no match for me.
You'll be glad to know I didn't fall to my death.
Praise Ra.
The deal doesn't count if I die.
The whole point is for Zaya and I both to be here, together. Breathing!
Breathing!
Behind you!
BEK: Horus! Horus!
Oh, Ra, dear Ra, please, help us! (SCREAMING)
Horus! We are going to die!
HORUS: After you.
Are you sure you can do this?
I saved you, didn't I?
-Oh, you saved me? -Only because you're useful to me.
BEK: You know what would be useful?
Your other eye. I could steal it back for you, if you like.
Don't test my patience, mortal.
My name is not "mortal."
What is it, then?
Bek.
Very well, Bek.
The roads will be watched now.
Set will send better hunters.
Well, that didn't go according to plan, did it?
MNEVIS: No, Lord.
My nephew did all this with one eye?
I underestimated his strength.
Tough to kill, that boy.
Like his uncle.
Where's he going? Who's he allying with?
His only ally is the mortal.
It's hardly an army, is it?
I overheard them.
The mortal spoke of a bargain he'd made with Horus.
This is one ambitious mortal.
Horus has agreed to bring the mortal's woman back from death.
Are you sure?
I'm certain of it, Lord. (GRUNTS)
You should really get that attended to.
-Yes, Lord. Thank you. -Good job.
You should have trusted us with this from the start.
Haven't we always left you satisfied?
Then satisfy me again.
Did you let your wife live?
Sooner or later, you and I will end up just the same.
The Land of the Dead and its Nine Gates.
Is it accurate, Mistress of the West?
Don't call me that. I left all that behind.
Soon, I will rule all the world.
The Land of the Dead is the final kingdom left standing.
You want things you can't have.
I want you to take me there. But you're a living soul.
But you're a living soul.
Yes. And you were a living soul, too, when you were counselor to the dead.
You know what's waiting for me if I go back.
You have your little bracelet to protect you from those demons.
It's not that.
(WHISPERING) You miss it. Don't you?
The darkness. What it brought out in you.
(WHISPERS) No.
Ah, you're not so good, Goddess of Love.
I know.
Then do this. Prove your loyalty to me. Then we can have everything.
Prove your loyalty to me. Then we can have everything. Together.
(SOFTLY) Horus... My love.
HATHOR: Horus...
You're not in your father's tomb?
I was wondering where he was. (GASPS)
Now I know.
Thanks.
For someone who bends the will of men
For someone who bends the will of men by batting her lashes,
you're not very clever.
How long has he had his sight? Why do you care?
Why do you care? (SCOFFS)
I'm yours now. I'll do as you've asked.
Even if I kill Horus?
(WHISPERING) Of course. Who cares about him?
I'd have thought you'd be exhausted from so much lying.
I loved Nephthys once and I took her wings.
Imagine what I'll do to you.
Do that and I'll hunt you down.
FEMALE DEMON: Let me touch.
I suppose it's better than running. (PANTING)
Can we find a less unpleasant campsite next time?
This used to be a garden like you've never seen.
What happened?
It was my father's first temple.
In his generosity, he opened the grounds so the poor could bury their own here.
Set has corrupted his teachings.
My father loved this place.
So Set brought him here to be butchered.
His body was cut into 14 pieces. The heart was never found.
Set salted the earth?
No. It was my mother's tears.
Before she took her own life.
I failed them.
I'm sorry.
Ra told me I was on a journey.
And if I reach the end, I will be mighty again.
How does it end?
With vengeance. Ends with my spear through Set's skull.
Is that a storm? There's no clouds.
(GROWLING) Set's hunters riding their pets.
Those aren't pets. A cat is a pet.
I can't withstand their venom. Not as I am now. Then I guess we should run.
Then I guess we should run.
Run? Mortals do it all the time!
Run faster!
I can't!
Run faster! I can't!
I can't!
HORUS: Come on!
-We have to kill them. -"We"?
When you go fishing, what's most important?
-I don't fish. -It's the quality of the bait.
It's too dangerous.
Are you worried about me?
Are you worried about me? No, it's just my aim with a spear is not what it was.
Then get closer before you throw it.
Hey! Beautiful!
I meant the snake! (GRUNTS)
That worked great. Let's go again.
This time, the bait needs to dangle longer.
I must strike the weak spot from behind.
And how do you know they have a weak spot?
I don't. But they must, right? Go! (WHIMPERING)
Excellent! You've made it angry.
(HORUS GROANS) Too bad you can no longer fly. (GRUNTING)
Neither can you.
You!
Just shut up and stay out of my way.
Pretty girl, you don't belong in battle.
Burn her! (HISSING)
What a lovely creature you are.
Let me help you.
ASTARTE: Burn her!
You are so very cold.
Warm yourself. I command you. (GROWLING)
Quickly.
Your company was preferable.
HORUS: Outrageous! HATHOR: You're welcome for saving your life.
HATHOR: You're welcome for saving your life. So while I was sitting blind in my father's tomb,
you shared a bed with the god who pulled out my eyes.
Why would I waste this on someone who can't see?
Why would I ever trust you again?
He's slaying all the gods who won't bow to him. That includes me.
We're breaking into Set's temple. Horus is going to kill him.
How were you planning to get in?
Him?
He's seen the plans. He knows the way.
What about the Sphinx? Have you forgotten about that? "Sphinx"?
"Sphinx"?
Set captured it to guard his fire.
It will kill mercilessly all who enter
if they cannot answer its riddle.
You can answer the riddle, right?
We shall ask Thoth for help.
(SCOFFS) Why would you ever do that on purpose?
So we won't have to die any sooner than is absolutely necessary. Let's go.
Did he give you that dress?
I chose from what was provided.
So you chose the one you thought would please him the most.
I dress to please myself. HORUS: Hmm.
Why? You don't like it?
It's too much.
I'm the Goddess of Too Much.
And there's plenty I've given you you've never found excessive.
Now it's maybe too little.
You never used to be so hard to please.
You're slowing us down. Ooh.
I think it makes you look roguish.
What did I look like before?
-Oblivious. -Oh!
But in a cute way.
Oblivious of what?
Exactly. You always did take me for granted.
What?
With your eye back, you should have come to get me.
-Oh? -Don't I mean enough to you?
Be a dear and fetch me some clean water.
Would it kill you to say "please"?
I'm really not in the mood to argue.
Go get it for me. I command you.
You're all the same, aren't you?
What's her name?
I can make any man, woman, god or beast do my bidding.
Unless their heart belongs to another.
You're in love.
Her name's Zaya.
I'm so sorry.
I promised her a proper home.
Money for a family. Respectability.
I gave her nothing.
Oh, she wouldn't have been with you if she didn't love you. Believe me, I know. I'm going to make it up to her.
I'm going to make it up to her. But I thought she...
But I thought she...
Horus is going to bring her back.
He said that?
I know it's hard to see past his
short temper and proclamations of revenge but... He's not so bad.
It is hard to see.
There it is.
BEK: Is that him?
-Them? -Of course not.
Then who are they? (GASPS)
His trusted servants.
He only trusts himself.
Rich with generous compost.
Colorful. Mainly in the green and red spectrums.
Variegated varieties with inflorescences composed of multiple florets,
Variegated varieties with inflorescences composed of multiple florets, each with a modified calyx.
each with a modified calyx.
Wise Lord of the Sacred Word, we seek your counsel.
Once, a weed, uprooted and burned.
Now prized for the vigor of its oils
and the sustenance of its leaves.
But what is its truth?
You! Turn around.
You prefer the view from behind? No, I... Well, yes.
No, I... Well, yes.
You know I can't lie. Turn.
I'm not going to risk looking at those tricky eyes of yours.
-Forty-seven. -Excuse me?
The percentage of knowledge I have so far recorded. I'm not even half done.
-Thoth, I only need... -The answer to the riddle of the Sphinx.
A child could deduce why you're here. Go ask the riddle
Go ask the riddle and come back and relay it to me. I'll solve it.
One of us would have to die.
Well, draw lots.
-Come with us. -Ha!
-One night. -I'll give you one night. Hmm...
No, you won't.
Set must be stopped before he destroys us all.
You see the wisdom in that, don't you?
This is far too important to risk.
I can recite the true names of the stars.
I know.
I know. I've seen the world created from sand and water. Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm. I contain all the wisdom in the universe.
More precious than some crown. Ha! I have it!
Its mystery. Its essence. Its truth.
It's lettuce!
Your father dropped his guard.
That was not only extremely stupid,
but now I'm forced to write down everything I know
as a defense against the remote possibility
that Set's war finds me.
I'm sorry that the corpses of my parents have inconvenienced you.
Apology accepted. Now, get out!
But you have to help us! (SWORDS CLATTERING)
THOTH: Careful. I outnumber you.
It's fine. I'll do it.
I thought you were a stray baboon.
I told you I'd be the one to face the Sphinx.
Your chance of failure is overwhelming.
I'm sure. But before it kills me
I'm going to tell it that I asked the God of Wisdom to come
but he was afraid he'd get the answer wrong.
This is the cleverest strategy you could devise?
Playing on my ego? How vain do you think I am?
How vain do you think I am?
Yes, well... Fine. Fine!
Let's go.
Bye.
Well done.
Thank you.
HATHOR: You know his Zaya can never come back.
The King doesn't have the power. Anubis doesn't have the power.
You deceived him.
He will probably die trying to break into Set's pyramid.
He offered his life.
Because he thought he could save her.
He believes what he wants to believe.
You've been blind in more ways than one.
You really watched the world come into being? I don't lie.
I don't lie.
Where were you watching it from, if nothing had been created yet?
If I even attempted to explain,
your brain would liquefy and run out of your ears.
I did not choose a path of revenge. I chose none of this.
You tell me what kind of power do I really have?
You have the power to make this right.
He deserves to know the truth.
I need him to get us in to choke Set's fire.
If he refuses, we'll all die. Is that what you want?
It's too dangerous to cross the plain. We'll wait for darkness.
But we're running out of time. -I say we cross now. -And I say we wait.
All the time you were apart, she never forgot you.
You've always been in Hathor's heart, you know.
Yes, but she's got a big heart. Room enough for a crowd in there.
Tell me, oh, wise Lord of the Air.
Why do you think Set let you live?
She did it for love. You'd punish her for that? I didn't want her help.
I didn't want her help.
I only ever wanted one thing.
You know, I think everyone's a fool.
But you, My Lord, are bigger than most.
HATHOR: Are you thinking about her?
Of course you are.
I was once known as the Mistress of the West.
My duty was to help dead souls make their way to the Afterlife.
You traveled to the Land of the Dead?
I'm the Goddess of Love. Even to those who have died.
I was young. Easily seduced.
"Seduced"?
Demons.
This keeps them at bay.
The Bracelet of 42 Stars.
One for each of the demons Horus slayed to free me.
That's when I knew I loved him.
Zaya needs to know you're fighting for her.
So she does not lose hope.
(WHISPERS) Zaya.
Zaya.
Zaya? Zaya? Can you hear me?
Zaya?
Who is it? Who's there?
Hathor, Mistress of the West. ZAYA: Mistress.
I speak to you from the Land of the Living.
Your beloved is with me.
Bek? Zaya, it's me.
I knew if there was a way, you would find it.
But I can't see you.
BEK: Listen, we can be together again. You can return.
But how?
I'm helping Horus. In return, he's going to help us.
ZAYA: It is really the Bek I love?
I know, Zaya. I can hardly believe it myself.
(CHUCKLES) Bek, me, trusting the gods.
But I was wrong, Zaya.
Horus is a just god, as you said he would be.
You're probably thinking, "I told you so," right now.
Well, yes. Just a little bit. (LAUGHS)
It's so good to hear your voice.
BEK: Everything's going to be fine, Zaya, trust me.
Horus is going to bring you back. I know he will.
Bek? Bek, are you there?
(STAFF CLATTERS) (GASPS) It is forbidden for the dead to speak with the living.
Go.
There's a wheel inside. When you turn it, the sand stops moving.
We just need to go through the door.
Good thing you saw those plans.
HORUS: If you didn't know which one it was, this would truly be impossible.
-Bek? -Yes?
You do know which is the door, right?
Yes, of course, it's... This one.
No, no, it's... It's that one.
No, no, it's this one!
Roll the bones.
THOTH: You guessed? (STUTTERS) Well...
(STUTTERS) Well...
I find your dependence on chance troubling.
If you continue to survive, I may need to study you further.
Now, which way to the Sphinx?
Trespassers in the House of the King,
answer my riddle or cease to be. Go on.
Go on. I'm waiting.
I never was. Am always to be. No one ever saw me, nor ever will.
No one ever saw me, nor ever will.
And yet I am the confidence of all who live and breathe.
What am I?
Order. You are Order.
I never doubted you.
Incorrect.
Try again. Please.
That was a completely suitable answer. (GROWLING)
You are Purity.
Wrong again.
(STUTTERING) "What never was."
(STUTTERING) "What never was." "Always to be." In the future. Non-existent. Imaginary.
In the future. Non-existent. Imaginary. (ROARING)
THOTH: Yet it exists and "never was." "Always to be." (STRAINING) Thoth...
"Always to be." (STRAINING) Thoth...
Yet I'm the confidence of all who live and breathe.
Mortals live and breathe! Maybe stop thinking like a god.
Then I might as well stop thinking.
Thoth!
Wait, wait, I have it!
You are Tomorrow.
Oh, bother.
HORUS: One drop.
No! (VOICES ECHOING AND MURMURING)
I should thank you.
You lured him from his library so that I didn't have to.
The final piece.
You coward. Open this gate and fight me. Again?
Hasn't she's seen you lose enough?
Can't you allow me to spare you one last moment of embarrassment
one last moment of embarrassment before you die?
Stop!
Recognize this?
Did he tell you he could bring your woman back from death?
It's not possible. Not even for me.
You expect me to believe you?
I don't have to lie.
How else would a blind, useless god get you to help him?
Go on. Ask him.
-Pour it in. -Is it true?
Bek, pour it in!
No!
Shame you weren't on my side.
I admire someone that doesn't let death stand in his way.
But this is what love gets you.
It's quite fitting that you'll both die together here in my house.
I'll miss the conversation. And the rest.
You denied me vengeance. (PANTING)
Zaya thought you were the greatest thing in all of creation.
Every day, she prayed for you to save Egypt, but you didn't come. I was in a tomb. I didn't hear.
I was in a tomb. I didn't hear. No, you didn't listen.
No, you didn't listen.
All you care about is your stupid vengeance.
I started to think I was wrong about you.
But I've finally learned the lesson of the gods. We don't matter to you.
Well, now you know.
Anubis, come forth.
Mistress. You are still as lovely as the first dawn. Hathor, what are you doing?
Hathor, what are you doing?
This mortal's beloved bears no treasure for the scales. Perhaps we can help her.
Perhaps we can help her.
You ask much, Mistress.
It would require a very special treasure indeed. No.
No. -No. No! -Like this?
-No. No! -Like this?
For you, Mistress of the West? Yes.
Grant him passage to give it to her himself.
You will see her one last time.
Thank you.
No, no, I forbid it.
We're both guilty of deceiving Bek. This will make amends.
Not like this. Not with you.
I command you to release me.
You can't command me. You know why.
I'm the Goddess of Love.
If I don't do this, I'm nothing.
I can't lose you again.
(GROANS)
Take it.
Do what you need to do.
The Hall of Two Truths. Where we shall be judged.
HEAD JUDGE: Step forward.
What do you offer?
Step forward.
I shall live forever!
HEAD JUDGE: What do you offer?
Step forward.
Step forward.
What do you offer?
What do you offer?
Zaya.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Bek.
SLAVES: Set, receive the golden wings of Nephthys.
May they protect him from those who would harm.
SLAVES: The karr of Thoth, God of Wisdom. Allow him knowledge of old.
The heart of Osiris. Grant him dominion over all Lands.
The all-seeing eye. Reward him so no enemy can deceive.
You look glorious, Lord.
I know.
SET: Father...
I noticed the tower. Impressive.
I built it for you.
If it were any taller, it would be in my way.
Turn your eyes from your sails and look at everything I've done.
What Osiris never could.
I rule all that breathes. And all that is breathed upon.
None is mightier below the sun.
Then honor me as I've honored you.
If honor had been your intent,
you might have abstained from murdering your brother.
So you do see everything down there.
Tell me, Father, do you care what happens?
I care more than you know.
Then why was I cast out alone
(WHISPERING) to walk on burning sand
while my brother played barefoot by the shores of the Nile?
Why did you make Osiris King?
And why did you give him a son?
And yet you denied me the chance to even give life.
This was your test.
You didn't test him.
I gave Osiris the crown of Egypt.
And when the time came, he didn't cling to his power.
He gave it away freely. He passed his test.
And I'd wager I've passed mine.
Not yet.
It's true... I did not want you to have children.
This was a kindness,
because I did not want you to miss them as terribly as I have.
Miss them?
I need you to take my place.
Here?
This is how your test ends, my son.
There is no greater burden. But no greater honor.
All you have done can be forgiven.
You expect me to joust with this beast
night after night until I die?
What do you want?
Immortality.
Immortality awaits us all in the Afterlife.
I don't want to die. I want to live. Forever.
Down there in the lands I conquered. My kingdom.
This should be my reward.
How? The only way to achieve this is unthinkable.
One would need to devour...
The Afterlife itself.
You would unleash Chaos upon creation?
You would destroy everything?
Not destroy. Reshape it.
I will take your place.
But it won't be sitting on some damn boat.
No god could withstand that.
I'm not just one god.
HEAD JUDGE: What do you offer?
This will buy you a place in the Afterlife.
ZAYA: No.
Not without you.
The gate has been broken!
Chaos spreads. Apophis shall destroy this land.
Horus is our only hope now.
He's not the god you think he is, Zaya. He lied to me.
Give him another chance. He only got this far because of you.
My strength is not infinite.
If the Lord of the Air has any plan to rectify this,
he should do so with haste.
If you don't trust him, trust me.
I know we'll be together again.
HORUS: Ra has fallen. Set has unleashed Chaos.
So how do we stop him?
You never give up, do you?
Only because Zaya told me not to.
You didn't tell her about our bargain?
Yes, I did tell her. But for some reason, she still believes in you.
We must return to the capital.
Then we have a long walk ahead of us.
I prefer flying.
Nephthys.
Even beyond death, she's trying to help us.
Come, demon!
HORUS: Set has Ra's spear.
He's drawing Apophis to the Nile, to the source of all life. Why?
Why?
To drink it. To destroy all creation.
To drink it. To destroy all creation. Ra isn't dead. And only he can make this right.
But he needs his spear.
So how do we get it back?
Maybe it's time we go fishing.
(URSHU PRAYING INDISTINCTLY) I come in your service, I ask for your help.
(GASPS) HORUS: Builder.
We have need of you.
It is the single greatest architectural achievement
that ever was and ever will be.
My... I mean, Lord Set's obelisk
stands exactly 2,220 cubits tall. And not a rod off.
Built from seven billion blocks of granite, five billion slabs of Tura limestone,
and nine billion talents of gold.
And the lives of how many slaves?
5,930.
No, wait.
Make that 5,931.
Don't! You need him to get to the roof.
HORUS: I'll see you up top.
You stood beside him as if he were your friend.
Oh, I know how it feels.
Favor of a god. It's intoxicating.
I'm sorry you picked the wrong one to follow.
He's improving.
Your woman's still dead, isn't she?
Shame. Such a pretty girl.
Such lovely soft skin. (GROANS)
Riches for the Afterlife.
You see? I'm ready to die.
SET: Come, Apophis!
You should have stayed under the sand.
I can understand killing for a crown, but this is madness.
Of course you don't understand. How could you?
Favored son of a favored son.
By the way, Apophis is going to eat the Land of the Dead.
You'll never make it to the Afterlife now.
(STRAINS) What?
Who picked the wrong god now?
I think I may actually miss our little get-togethers.
But you're still no match for me.
You're right.
I'm just the bait.
Now you're just becoming a pest.
Horus!
You don't think your eye might have been more useful than a wounded thief?
Probably, yes.
I'm sorry for everything I've done to you. (GRUNTS)
Including this. Accepted.
Accepted.
(CHUCKLES) I told you I'd steal your other eye.
But you could have saved me some trouble and told me you didn't need it.
Ra showed me the way, but I didn't listen.
I believed I needed my eye to transform,
I believed I needed my eye to transform, but my journey isn't to seek revenge at all costs.
It is to protect my people.
Stop congratulating yourself.
You've got more protecting to do.
Behold, the new King.
I thought you were the greatest of all the gods.
(GRUNTS) Now look at you. You have nothing.
I am the greatest god.
I spared you once. Huh? I showed you mercy.
I won't make that mistake.
HORUS: Grandfather, there's still time.
Enough, beast!
Thank you.
HORUS: We make a good team. Are you sure you're not a god?
What would I be the god of? (EXHALES HEAVILY)
Stupidity?
The Impossible.
Bek?
I have never been in debt. And yet I am in debt to you, grandson.
Ask whatever you will.
Mountains will kneel before you. The winds will do your bidding. Answer quickly, for Apophis still hungers.
Answer quickly, for Apophis still hungers.
And night is always coming.
I want nothing. Except what's impossible for me to give.
Am I...
(CHUCKLES) You've returned. (LAUGHING)
HORUS: Bek?
You might want to help her.
Zaya.
(SOFTLY) Bek.
HORUS: Zaya? I'm Horus. My Lord.
My Lord.
I thought this was impossible. Impossible? Yes.
Impossible? Yes.
CROWD: Hail Ra, Lord of Light! Hail Ra, Lord of Light!
OLDER BEK: And so wisdom had been found.
Tests had been passed. Second chances given.
To live again. To be whole again.
Horus mourned his parents.
They had long since passed into the Afterlife.
But he knew it was the wisdom of Ra
that the Final Gate would remain as it had always been.
An unbreakable barrier between this life and immortality.
You think I'm ready?
Hmm, true readiness is a notoriously difficult state to achieve.
-But you're close enough. -Hmm.
Arise, Horus... King of all Egypt.
From this moment on,
the Afterlife must be earned, not with gold,
but by good deeds, compassion, and generosity.
What we do, how we act in this life matters.
Are you thinking about her?
Of course, you are.
You didn't think I'd misplace Egypt's greatest treasure?
You think they'd miss me if I were gone a few days?
As Chief Advisor to the King,
it's my duty to ensure they hardly notice. (CHUCKLES) BEK: But if anyone asks...
(CHUCKLES) BEK: But if anyone asks...
Now, do you love your son?
Now, do you understand?
You have a $10 million insurance policy. I know that.
Follow these instructions...
...or God be with your child.
You will remove your shirt... ...and hold it out the window to ID the car.
Be professional.
Come alone.
Georgina! Obey me. I will love you. Come on.
- That's how it works, huh? - That's right.
She got a sister?
How's business?
The Japanese are here in a big way.
Cheap labor, factory space, but they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso.
I ferry them back and forth. They think I'm John Wayne.
- I live like a king down here. - Yes, you do.
- You been working? - Yeah. No. No. I've been moving around. You know. Colombia, a couple of places I can't name.
No. I've been moving around. You know. Colombia, a couple of places I can't name.
Nothing catches my fancy.
You think God'll forgive us for what we've done? - No. - You don't?
- No. - You don't? Me either.
- How long you staying? - I don't know, I just, you know...
I wanted to see you, Ray, see how you're doing.
I just came by on impulse.
I could do with some impulse.
What happened?
Family paid the ransom, then they sent the kid home after a couple of days.
Minus an ear, of course.
Now every mother in Mexico City with money wants bigger bodyguards. - My own wife included. - I hate to break it to you, but she's right.
- My own wife included. - I hate to break it to you, but she's right. She's right.
Look, Sammy, all my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
I have a policy. AIG. My dad gave it to me.
Yeah, I know. I got it for your dad.
But what'll you do in 60 days when you can't renew it because you have no bodyguard?
I know. I had to let Emilio go.
Well, you gotta please Lisa. I mean, ass like that's hard to find.
Look.
A bodyguard's like anything else. You get what you pay for, okay?
You could do this. Get one that's got a decent résumé. We're not looking for goddamn Superman, right? Get someone cheap.
We're not looking for goddamn Superman, right? Get someone cheap.
So you renew the policy, and then fire the prick for whatever, incompetence.
All kidding aside, the most important thing is that your daughter goes back to school,
and that your wife gets to save face.
This way you won't be the only unprotected family in the neighborhood.
That's right, a bodyguard. Your Spanish is good enough.
- You're crazy. - You even look the part.
In my state, I couldn't guard a corpse.
It's rich guys flashing their cash. It's all for show. Nothing's gonna happen.
Yeah? You think they'd hire a drunk, a has-been?
You have to keep it under control.
What if there was, you know... Just, say, a kidnapping attempt? What do I do then?
You do your best. They're not gonna be paying you enough to perform miracles.
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed, you're pretty damn good.
Yeah. A bodyguard's gotta be close to people, though. They talk all the time. You know I'm no good at that.
You'll be the silent type. They're gonna appreciate that.
Bodyguard. So who's the guy?
Samuel Ramos. He's a young guy.
- He owns one of the plants in Juárez. - Yeah?
The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him.
I think he's in trouble. His family lives in Mexico City.
He asked me if I knew anybody he could trust.
- And you thought of me? - Yeah.
Take a job, Crease. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to stick around.
Besides, I'm glad to see you, you know? I got nobody to talk to down here.
Listen, my wife wants someone presentable and polite.
You'll be the fifth candidate she sees this week.
Your résumé's quite impressive.
Sixteen years of military experience, extensive counter-terrorism work.
I'm surprised anybody could afford you. What's the catch?
I drink.
How does that affect you?
Coordination, reaction time.
If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, I'll do the best I can,
but the service will be on a par with the pay.
What if amateurs try it?
I'd probably kill them. Is that likely?
No.
No one is to know about your drinking. That includes my wife.
Lisa!
My wife Lisa. And this is John Creasy.
- You're an American. - So are you.
It's all in there.
- Would you like a drink? - Yes. Jack and water would be good.
Have you done much of this kind of work before? No, ma'am.
But he has a lot of experience in related fields.
- Do you have a family, Mr. Creasy? - No.
Pita? Pita.
- Yes, Mom? - Honey, this is Mr. Creasy.
It's English, honey. Do you wanna show Mr. Creasy to his room?
- This way, Mr. Creasy. - Okay.
Thank you.
Just like that?
I think it's nice that he's an American.
I think it's terrific. Are you sure?
Thank you. Thank you.
I feel better now.
That's Bruno, the gardener. And that's Maria, the cook.
We fixed the room up two weeks ago. It's nicer than before.
You've got a TV and a CD player. What kind of music do you like, Mr. Creasy?
- I don't know. - You don't know?
I don't know.
That's Bird. Emilio forgot to take him when he left.
Emilio was my last bodyguard.
Have you protected a lot of children before, Mr. Creasy?
Creasy. You can call me Creasy. And no, you're the first.
Bye, Creasy.
Bye, Bird.
- School tomorrow, Peeps. - Does that mean we can get a dog?
Dad promised me one when I went back to school. Yeah, we'll see.
If you get a dog, will you give up your bear? You're getting too old for him.
- How did you like Mr. Creasy? - Creasy. He said to call him just Creasy.
- That isn't disrespectful, is it? - No, not if he asked you.
Here. There you go.
He's like a bear too. - Yeah? - A big, sad bear.
- Yeah? - A big, sad bear.
- Is he sad? - I think. Or something.
Good night, honey.
Can you get me some floss in the morning? - Floss? - Yeah, the strawberry kind.
Sure.
Good night, Bear.
Creasy Bear.
- What's that one for? - La Virgen de Guadalupe.
Business. For Toyota, for Ford.
If one dies, maybe she can resurrect the other one. I don't know.
She likes him.
- What are you talking about? - Creasy.
Pita likes him.
Pita loves school. Pita would love Count Dracula if he took her back there, honey.
Okay?
Hey. Are you okay?
- I don't know. - Okay?
I don't know, Lisa. I'm trying.
Come on, Bird.
That's right, that's right. Come on.
All right.
Home to Emilio.
You're home free, baby.
- Where are you from, Creasy? - The U.S.
- I know, but which state? - No state in particular.
- You can drive and talk at the same time. - No, I can't, so please let me do my job.
Are you going to stay?
My last bodyguard left. Somebody gave him more money than we could.
I guess that makes me a bargain, then, huh?
Being black. Is that a positive or a negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Time will tell.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. - Four a day. - Yeah? Twenty-four?
- Four a day. - Yeah? Twenty-four? - Twenty-four. What do you think? - I think you know more than you should.
- Twenty-four. What do you think? - I think you know more than you should. Well, thank you.
- See you later. - You have to sign.
- What? - You have to sign in. Show them your ID.
Come on.
Right there.
Pita! It's so good to have you back.
Sister Anna, this is my new bodyguard, Creasy.
- Sister Anna, the headmistress. - Señor Creasy.
- Hurry. Class is about to begin. Go, go. - Bye, Creasy.
You must look after our Pita. It is not good that she is late today.
I'm very sorry. I have to get used to the routes. It won't happen again.
No offense, but I regret that your profession needs to exist.
So do I, Madre, so do I.
Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?
No, not for a long time.
The Bible says, "Be not overcome of evil..."
"But overcome evil with good."
That's Romans Chapter 12 Verse 21.
I am the sheep that got lost, Madre.
When you were a kid, Creasy, did you like school? - I don't remember. - You don't remember?
- I don't remember. - You don't remember? No, I don't remember. No, I didn't like it.
No, I don't remember. No, I didn't like it. Why not?
Because it wasn't a school like yours, Pita. There was no Sister Anna.
Were you unhappy?
Being unhappy, that's a state of mind. I really don't remember.
What happened to your hand?
- It's a birth defect. - No, it's not.
Look, no more questions, okay?
- It really wasn't a question. - It sounded like a question to me.
Listen to me. I'm being paid to protect you.
No, no, no. I'm being paid to be your bodyguard. Look at me.
I'm not being paid to be your friend, but to protect you. So no more questions, period.
- Do you hear me? - Yes.
- No crying. - I'm not crying.
Well, don't start.
You gotta understand, this is a job. In order for me to do my job...
Wait a minute.
Yeah, come in.
Mr. Creasy.
I just wanted to make sure you have everything you need. I'm fine, thanks.
Is the food all right? Because Maria told me you didn't eat.
Yeah, the food is great. I just wasn't that hungry tonight.
So you read the Bible?
Yeah, sometimes.
Does it help? Yeah, sometimes.
- Can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure.
How are you doing with Pita?
Fine.
As soon as she figures out that I'm not her new toy, it'll be fine.
- She told me about that. - Okay.
- You don't have children, do you? - I told you I didn't.
Well, they can be tenacious when they want something. And Pita just wants to be friends.
Okay. But you're paying me to protect her, not to be her friend, right?
So...
Look, maybe this isn't gonna work out.
Maybe your husband should find somebody that's a little more sociable.
No, you're right.
You're being paid to protect her.
And I'm confident that you'll do that.
I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I hope that's all right.
You think God'll forgive us for what we've done?
I'm tired of killing, Ray. I'm tired of killing, Ray.
You think God'll forgive us for what we've done?
In my state, I couldn't... I couldn't guard a corpse.
They talk all the time.
You know I'm no good at that.
You know how they say...
a bullet always tells the truth?
Yeah? - Hey. - Crease.
- Hey. - Crease. What's wrong?
Hey, listen, you ever have a 9mm round that didn't go off?
Yeah. Failure to fire.
I know, failure to fire and...
You know, I pulled the trigger and click, nothing.
- You're talking about a bad primer. - Yeah, yeah, but I...
Yeah, right. Dimple on the primer. That may be...
Well, like we used to say...
a bullet always tells the truth.
Crease? You all right?
Yeah.
What were you shooting at?
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ray. I'm sorry I woke you.
No, it's okay, it's nothing. I was watching TV.
Okay.
Pita, you have a pencil?
Thank you.
- It's hard to get used to the traffic here. - Yeah. I'm very sorry.
- See you, baby. - See you later.
- Hey, don't forget your towel. - Thank you.
Bye.
- You're a strong swimmer. - I never win.
Thanks.
So, what do I do?
You're the fastest in the water, the slowest off the blocks. What do you think that means? What you gotta do?
- Get faster off the blocks? - Get faster off the blocks.
- Our big swim meet is in three weeks. - Yeah?
- I was gonna enter the 150 freestyle. - You'll be fine. You'll be okay.
- I'll still be slow. - You're not slow.
- I never finish better than third. - Then maybe you are slow.
With us this evening we have Mariana Guerrero from Reforma newspaper
to speak with us about the kidnappings.
Who are the ones responsible for the kidnappings in Mexico?
It is an activity of organized crime. It's not a random kidnapping.
They are not political kidnappings like in Colombia.
How do you think he got out?
I let him go.
- It's better to be free, right? - It's better for him.
Actually, he was driving me crazy.
Good night.
Good night.
- See you in a couple of days. I love you. - Love you.
Be good. Come on, Lise.
All right, sweetheart, so we'll call you from Detroit, okay?
- I love you. - Love you.
- Okay, bye, honey. I love you! - Love you.
I hate leaving her.
Concentrating?
Eyes are closed?
- What happened? - I flinched.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
- The gunshot holds no fear. - The gunshot holds no fear! Say it!
- The gunshot holds no fear. - The gunshot holds no fear! Say it! - The gunshot holds no fear. - Louder!
- The gunshot holds no fear. - Louder! - The gunshot holds no fear! - Louder! - The gunshot holds no fear! - That's good. You welcome the sound.
- The gunshot holds no fear! - That's good. You welcome the sound. In fact, it's the sound that sets you free.
You are a prisoner on this block until that sound sets you free. Are you ready?
- Yes. - Are you ready? Are you set?
Creasy?
What's a concubine?
- Why do you ask? - It's in my history book.
- It's like a wife, right? - Yeah, yeah, it's...
Can I see that? It's kind of a wife.
Right there. But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them.
Okay, like nowadays, in the West, they have one husband for one wife.
But in the olden-time cultures they had, you know, different... Different rules.
Why? You feel sorry for the husband? Yeah. Can you imagine my mom multiplied by a thousand?
Creasy. - You're smiling. - What?
- You were smiling. - No, I'm not.
- You were. - No, I was not.
- You're not now, but you were. - You were smiling. I wasn't.
- You were. - When?
- Five seconds ago. - I'm not smiling.
- Well, a second ago you were. - You said five seconds ago. Now that's six.
- Well, a second ago you were. - You said five seconds ago. Now that's six. - Ten seconds ago. - Ten seconds ago I was smiling.
- Ten seconds ago. - Ten seconds ago I was smiling. Okay, in the next ten seconds, we'll see who smiles first.
- You smiled already. See? You did. - You.
No, that wasn't a... That was a smirk.
That's not a smile. A smirk is different. They start with S, but they're not the same.
- Do your homework. - You were.
Bang!
Stop, stop, stop. Come back, come back.
Bang!
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Come here. Hurry up, hurry up.
Set.
Bang! Bang!
You don't flinch when you hear the gunshot, understand?
Listen for the sound. You don't anticipate. Concentrate on the sound. Understand me?
They're gaining on you. Go, go, go, go!
Stop, stop! Come on, get out. Let's go again.
- Daddy! - Come here, girl.
- I missed you so much. - I missed you.
I got a surprise for you. Are you ready?
You got me a dog! You got me a dog!
- You bought me a dog! Oh, my gosh! - What do you think?
Oh, my gosh. Just what I wanted. What's his name?
- Sam. Like Dad. - Come on, Sam! Come on, Sam!
State...
Bhutan. It's a Himalayan kingdom.
They were having some problems with the royal family not long ago. Okay.
Any more questions?
- Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy? - What? No. What kind of question is that?
- You're supposed to be studying history. - It's Creasy history.
- No, ancient history. - Who was your very first girlfriend?
- Nonya. - Nonya? Nonya business, that's who. Okay?
Hi.
Tomorrow after you drop off Pita, could you take me to get my hair done?
Yes, ma'am.
All right. Well, I'll...
I'll leave you to your history.
- Good night. - Good night, honey.
- Okay, now ask me. - Ask you what?
Go, Pita! Go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go!
- 10.99. - Yes!
- I'm tough, Creasy. - No such thing as tough.
There's trained and there's untrained. Now, which are you?
- Trained. - Trained. Okay, we'll go again.
- Here. - Stand here near the finish line. Okay. Hey.
I'm a prisoner in the block until the gunshot sets me free.
That's right. Don't smile, don't fool around if you wanna win. Trained or untrained?
- Trained. - Go.
- Señor Creasy, nice to see you. - Good to see you, Madre.
Pita's parents are away on business in Juárez. Today, you are her father.
I won, Creasy! I won!
- Once upon a time, when we were young... - When I was young.
Well, when we were young and he was younger,
and all heads turned our way,
we made a deal to take the world together.
Yeah, then one day I got a call, and you said...
"I'm in love, I'm in love!" "And I'm moving to Mexico!"
And I said: I said, "What happened to the plan? What happened to it?"
- I said, "The plan's right here!" - Yeah, yeah. And what'd I do?
I hung up. And then I met Alicia.
And then I went, "Now I got you. I got you."
I got it. Can I kiss her?
Absolutely.
Hey, what are you doing?
- You got me. - Okay, I think now's as good a time as any.
I bought it with my own money.
Thank you.
Open it.
It's Saint Jude, the patron saint of lost causes.
Well deserved.
Thank you, Pita. It's beautiful.
You're welcome.
- Dad? - Yes, sweetie?
- Can I talk to you? - Yes.
I don't wanna play piano, I wanna swim.
It's not open for discussion, honey, okay? Mr. Lozzi's a very, very famous teacher.
If he accepts you as a student, you're gonna play the piano. Sorry.
- Whatever. - Baby.
- I love you. - Love you.
- I just want what's best for you, you know? - Okay.
Okay, honey.
If you broke all my fingers, then taped them back together,
I wouldn't be able to play piano, but I could still swim.
Sam, get back.
Don't be a crybaby. You're tougher than that.
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.
Remember the day you wanted the pencil? - Yeah. - I know why.
- Yeah. - I know why. Yeah?
You wanted the license number off of that car. I wrote it down in my notebook.
I got it all but the last number.
I'll get it from you later. Can you belch?
Like burp. Can you burp?
- That's good. That's very good. - I just had a Coke.
Listen to me. This famous teacher... He teaches a lot of rich kids and plays for the symphonies and all that, right?
Belch every few minutes while you're practicing. You apologize to him, but keep belching. You'll offend every sensibility he has.
You apologize to him, but keep belching. You'll offend every sensibility he has.
Very good. You'll be back in the pool in 24 hours, I guarantee you.
Right, Sam?
Lupita Ramos.
For you, Creasy.
Thank you.
- How does this look? - Good. Good.
Come on in. - Bye. - Bye.
- How long? - One hour.
Pita!
Run!
I can't...
John W. Creasy is under arrest for the murder of two officers of the Judicial Police.
This man, John W. Creasy,
an American citizen,
is under arrest for the murder
of two officers of the Judicial Police
and is suspected of possible involvement
in the kidnapping of Lupita Martin Ramos.
Chief Ramirez...
The two officers who were killed.
Records show they were off duty at the time.
So why were they in uniform
and in a patrol car?
All I know is that they died bravely.
Of course,
but what exactly were they doing
at the scene of the kidnapping?
Or were they known for their exceptional good luck?
They were known for being corrupt
and now are celebrated for being dead.
Excuse me.
Relax, okay? Relax, Sammy.
I know she's your little girl. When I tell you everything's gonna be all right, everything's gonna be all right.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Victor Fuentes, Anti-Kidnapping Division, Policía Judicial.
Excuse me. I'm Jordan Kalfus. I'm the family attorney.
Speak slower, please. My Russian is better than my English.
I'm conducting the negotiations, and we neither need nor want police assistance.
We're gonna handle this thing ourselves.
Señor Ramos, two police officers were killed during your daughter's abduction.
I have a written order from
the Public Minister...
authorizing our participation "unofficially."
If you want to speak to Attorney General Diaz, it's on me.
Okay.
The kidnapper will tell you to deliver the money alone.
Por favor, don't do that.
Or you will find yourself in a real Mexican hell. No mariachi, no tequila...
and no Pita.
Crease?
When I heard it was this hospital, I was so pleased.
There is a pastry shop nearby. Delgado's.
They have the best pastries in Mexico.
Miguel Manzano. Director of the AFI.
And a former director of Interpol, in Rome.
- And you are? - A friend of his. Rayburn.
Do you love your daughter, Señor Ramos?
Yes. Yes.
- Do you want to see her again? - Yes, I do.
If your daughter's life is as important to you as it is to me,
you will do as I say.
Yes?
Okay, yes.
Crease. You hear me?
You got four of them, all dead.
- Pita? - It's...
It's been two days.
They're negotiating a ransom.
These things take time, Mr. Creasy.
Crease.
Don't fuck with me, all right?
You have the ten million? Do you have the money?
- Yes, we have the money. - Now, if you do as I say,
the girl will be returned exactly as she was taken.
But if you deviate from the process in any way...
By the Virgin of Guadeloupe,
I swear you will never see her again.
I understand. Listen, I too worship la Virgen de Guadalupe...
I ask if you understand.
Hello, sir. This is Mr. Ramos's attorney.
He's going through a very difficult time, but he understands.
Do you understand? Repeat the drop instructions.
Okay, the money, 10 million, will be divided into two 15-gallon black canvas bags,
each containing five million, which will be checked at the bank by the KR agent,
then driven to the house where it will be transferred to the delivery car.
You got a flat tire here.
This is for you.
Hello. Yeah. Listen, I need a driver to drive Samuel.
No. Why?
He's got a bad ticker. He's got a heart condition.
Look, he's a nervous kid. He doesn't respond well to stress.
All right, but the car will not be powerful.
Remove the trunk lid. Use the maid's Valiant Acapulco.
You will arrive at La Diana fountain at 1 a.m.
You will drive around the circle two times.
Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window
to ID the car.
There is a payphone on the southeast corner.
The phone will ring. You will answer and wait for instructions.
There is a map on the top of the phone. Follow it.
- What are you doing? He said no phones. - Relax, relax. I'm just trying to protect your daughter, okay?
What's going on?
Hospitals can be very dangerous places,
especially when you have killed two corrupt cops.
Leave the money in the trunk of the white car
and return to your car.
Do not look back.
What's going on, guys?
Ambush!
Remember, I'm a professional.
If you keep your word, I will keep mine.
- Hello? - Mr. Ramos.
You betrayed me. You killed my nephew.
You took my money.
Señor Ramos...
God be with your child.
All right. Get out of here, all of you. Get the fuck out of my house!
Okay, this is Lisa... Martin Ramos. I'm Pita's mother.
Martin Ramos. I'm Pita's mother.
And I'm very sorry for whatever happened to your nephew, but I beg you...
Please don't harm my daughter.
This conversation is not being recorded.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I wish we had talked sooner, señora.
I'm really sorry.
Now it is too late.
Fuck off! Get the fuck out of my fucking house! Now!
Get out! Get out!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, Ray. How are you...?
- Where am I? - Well, it looks like a dog hospital.
Manzano was afraid the cops were gonna kill you.
How you doing, doc?
What's the matter?
She's dead, Crease.
It's a mess. Somebody hijacked the drop and...
The kidnapper's nephew was killed, so he killed Pita.
He has gunshot wounds to the chest and the abdomen.
He has a collapsed lung which we've re-inflated.
He's lucky to be alive. If he doesn't rest, he will die.
How long will he be hospitalized?
Approximately a month.
No.
Did you recognize any of these men?
No. Does that make me a suspect?
No. It would be convenient, but no.
Maybe you should show me pictures of Mexican cops. Maybe we'll get somewhere.
Those were all policemen.
Bad Judicial cops,
protected, by a brotherhood.
A brotherhood?
A brotherhood called... "La Hermandad."
"La Hermandad."
You all set?
- Right arm. - Yeah.
- You okay? - Yeah, I'm all right.
Let's go.
- Somebody's on us. - Yeah.
- Lois Lane. - Who?
Mariana something, works for Reforma.
Newspaper journalist.
I guess she thinks you're a scoop.
I'll get you up to the border. A friend will take you to San Diego, drop you at the Naval Hospital.
I'm not going, Ray.
What are you gonna do?
Let's take a ride by the crime scene. She can follow us.
Mr. Creasy?
A lot of people are looking for you.
I'm Mariana García Guerrero.
Reporter, for Reforma.
Nice to meet you.
I found this across the street.
Open it.
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship.
- They've put a curse on you. - A little late.
- What are you going to do? - I'm gonna get in my truck and leave.
I can help you.
There's a brotherhood called La Hermandad.
It protects government officials, corrupt police and organized crime
at a level that is too difficult for me to reach.
Okay.
And I think that you and Lupita Ramos are victims of this organization.
I want to expose them. Talk to me, give me your story, and then I can help you. Please.
Help me do what?
You're gonna help me do what?
- You're a stranger here, no? - That's right.
You're going to need friends that know their way around.
Okay.
Okay, friend that's gonna help me.
Pleasure to meet you.
Tell your driver to keep his distance next time. All right, friend?
- You'll be Stateside by supper time. - I'm gonna need some help first, though.
You don't stop bleeding, you won't last a day in your shape.
- Is that a yes or is that a no? - Yeah! But... - I'm done killing. I told you that. - Okay.
- I'm done killing. I told you that. - Okay. Anything else is yours.
- You're talking about war, Crease. - Exactly. Can you help me?
- Yeah. - Good.
Creasy?
What are you doing here?
I came to get my stuff.
Couldn't find my Bible. I thought it might be in here.
- I borrowed it. - Okay.
It's crazy, huh?
One week we're figuring out which nightclub to go to, and the next thing I'm... reading the Bible.
It's a good thing. You hold on to it.
I keep thinking if only we hadn't...
It's like...
My whole life all I've ever thought about was what I could get for myself.
Not my own baby.
She needed me so much, and sometimes I felt like I had nothing to give her.
Just... I don't know what to do.
- What are you gonna do? - What I do best.
I'm gonna kill them.
Anyone involved, who profited from it, anybody who opens their eyes at me.
You kill them all.
Yeah, it's me.
- Mr. Creasy. - I need the license... No, excuse me.
I need the name and address of someone whose license number is C5TK8.
I need the name and address of someone whose license number is C5TK8. That's C5TK8.
I got everything but the last digit, so I need ten possible matches.
And when do I find out which of the ten it is? - Eventually. - But where do I reach you?
- Eventually. - But where do I reach you? I'll call you.
Do you know who he is?
Do you know what he's been doing the last 16 years?
Counter-insurgency work in Thailand,
Pakistan...
Jordan, Angola, Lebanon. Yes, I know all of that.
He's an assassin...
and you want to help him identify the owner of a car for him?
He can go places we can't.
If you don't want to use him... I will.
When do I get to sleep with you again?
We never sleep. We fuck.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Jorge González.
I'm a Judicial Policeman.
Drive. Okay.
What are you gonna do?
What I do best.
Anyone involved, who profited from it, anybody who opens their eyes at me.
I'm gonna kill them.
Can you hear me?
My head hurts.
I am going to ask questions.
If you don't answer fully and truthfully,
you will suffer much more than you have to.
I'm going to cut your fingers off.
One by one, if I have to.
This is to stop the bleeding.
Don't mess with me.
You know who I am?
A member of La Hermandad.
- Correct. - Okay.
What do you want to know?
The Ramos kidnapping...
What went wrong at the drop?
We were just ordered to take her.
That's all we did.
Ordered by who?
I don't know.
You don't know?
We work in separate groups.
A voice calls.
We grab the target
and deliver it to the guardians.
The bosses never see the target,
they just make the deal.
Who ordered it?
We call him "The Voice."
"The Voice." Okay.
"The Voice."
The Voice. How do I find him?
You don't know?
Are you sure?
Okay.
I believe you.
Tell me about the guardians.
I'm a professional.
I'm a professional. I just do my job.
Tell me about the guardians.
You don't know?
I don't know.
He works the door at a rave in Neza.
He has a mark
on the left side of his face.
They call him "The Butcher."
Is he La Hermandad?
Yes, La Hermandad.
Okay.
Wait, wait, wait.
Give me one cigarette, please, eh?
Okay.
Okay, my friend.
It's off to the next life for you.
I guarantee you won't be lonely.
Revenge is a meal best served cold.
Tell me about the girl.
I don't know her.
Okay, okay. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
Tell me about the girl.
Do you know her?
Hey, man, I heard you speaking Spanish over there. You're American, right?
- And so are you. - Yeah.
- Get outta here. Where you from? - New Jersey.
New Jersey? I'm from New Jersey.
All right, listen to me.
Tell me how it works. The whole thing. Tell me how it works.
All right, everything is done by cellphone.
You just wait around for calls. We don't even have a fucking number.
- Who pays you? - We got an ATM card.
We take out 200 fucking measly dollars every two weeks.
- Two hundred dollars? - Yeah.
- Okay. What's the PIN number? - The what?
The PIN number, code number. - Yeah, it's 4747. - 4747?
- Yeah, it's 4747. - 4747?
- You wouldn't lie to me? - I'm not lying.
- You didn't kill her, did you? - No.
Don't lie to me! - Don't lie to me! Did you kill her? - You're making me fucking nervous.
- Did you kill her? - No! The fucking boss did, or his brother.
Who's the boss?
- We never see his face. - You're lying to me.
I'm telling you the truth! Who? You never seen whose face?
Well, we were in the other room.
And he was yelling at the girl because his nephew got killed and the money got stolen.
- Wait. Somebody stole what money? - The ransom money at the drop.
- Who stole it? - He said some fucking crooked cop took it.
- Who? - Fuentes.
- Fuentes? - Yeah, that's him.
- Jersey boy? - Yeah.
- This Fuentes guy... - Yeah?
He's a lieutenant for the Anti-Kidnapping Division. - Fuentes is? - Yeah.
- What'd you do? - Oh, man.
Tell me about the girl. What did you do?
- I just do what they tell me. - You do what they tell you to do?
Did you say goodbye to her? Answer. Did you say goodbye to her?
- No! - You didn't? - Here's your chance. Say goodbye. - Oh, shit.
- Here's your chance. Say goodbye. - Oh, shit. Say goodbye to her. Say goodbye to her.
Motherfucker, let me go!
They threw the little girl against the wall.
She wasn't moving.
They threw her body in the trunk of the car,
and then they drove away.
Who? Who? Who's they?
The boss's brother.
I recognized his voice.
Okay. Okay.
Now listen to me.
If you tell me where to find the boss,
I'll let you live.
But I don't know.
I'll give you the girl. I'll give you the girl.
What girl?
The girl...
Do you want the girl?
Yes, yes, but what girl? What are you saying?
- The girl. - Here?
You sure?
Show me.
- Guerrero. - Listen, it's me.
Do you know about a young girl being kidnapped recently, about 12 years old?
- Yes, last night. Do you know something? - What's her name?
Camila. Camila Valencias.
- I got her. - Where are you?
- Creasy, what happened? - It's okay. Sit down, relax.
She's okay, she's okay.
You got banking connections?
Yes, I have connections.
PIN number's 4747. I wanna find out who's putting money in that account.
4747.
What do you know about a cop named Fuentes?
He's with the Anti-Kidnapping Division. He drove Samuel Ramos to the drop. - Fuentes? - Who is she?
- Fuentes? - Who is she? You can ask her later. She'll tell you anything.
What do you know about Fuentes?
Three years ago they caught him with $50,000 and a dead body in the trunk.
Never charged. The arresting officer couldn't testify because he was dead.
Was he La Hermandad?
- You know where he lives? - He lives in a Judicial compound.
He travels by motorcade.
He's better protected than the president of Mexico. He's gonna need it. Can you take care of her?
- Yes, but how can I find you? - I'll find you.
This is my jurisdiction.
I want this man as much as Creasy does.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals.
Just stay out of his way. I plan to.
I will even help him, if I can.
But... I'd like to understand him.
Give me that.
Pita Ramos...
is a number to you.
One more dead, but a number.
What was she to Creasy, then? She showed him it was all right to live again.
And the kidnappers took that away, huh?
And they're gonna wish they never touched a hair on her head.
A man can be an artist...
at anything, food, whatever.
It depends on how good he is at it.
Creasy's art is death.
He's about to paint his masterpiece.
I don't have anything else to say.
I need the accounts linked to this card.
PIN number is 4747.
On one condition.
I'm not here to hurt you.
In the church, they say to forgive.
Forgiveness is between them and God.
It's my job to arrange the meeting.
Don't move. Put your hands down.
Señor John W. Creasy is under arrest for the murder of two officers of the Judicial Police...
Can you hear me?
You know where we are?
We're under the bridge
where the deal went bad and the ransom got stolen.
You wanna tell me what happened?
- You've heard of La Hermandad? - Yes, I have.
- You know what it is? - Yes.
I'm the president of La Hermandad.
- You're the president? - Yes. The president?
Look at me.
Oh, you can't. I'm sorry. How's that?
I'll show you what I got here.
See this? This is a charger.
It's used by convicts to hide money and drugs.
They stick it in their body, they tuck it up their rectum. You familiar with that?
This... Look at me. Pencil detonator.
Timer. Used as a receiver, a transmitter.
C4. Highly explosive.
You put them all together, you got a bomb. Not very sophisticated, but very powerful.
That's what you have in your ass right now.
Don't move. Don't move. Don't move.
Cheap watch, pager watch,
used to send a page to the receiver that's up your behind right now.
So... I'm gonna send you a page which you will receive...
in five minutes.
You got less than five minutes to tell me what went down between your men and the kidnapper.
I have nothing to do with the kidnapper.
- Four minutes and 30 seconds. - Nothing. I don't know him.
You don't know? Four minutes and 25 seconds.
Four minutes and 20 seconds. Are you sure?
Okay.
I got all the time in the world. You don't, but I do.
- Relax, relax, buddy. - I'm relaxed.
You got three minutes, 59 seconds.
- I saw the opportunity, and I got lucky. - And?
And I had my men ready, as we got instructions where to go.
You had your men ready to steal the drop, ready to kill one of the kidnappers, yeah? You've done this many times.
What's going on, guys?
- One of the nephews of the kidnapper. - Bingo, bingo, yeah.
You've done this many times. Many times, yes.
Yeah. You've killed many victims too, haven't you?
- We just make out as best we can. - "As best we could"?
Two minutes, 47 seconds.
Wait a minute.
- Come on, I have a little gift for you. - For me?
- Yeah, come on. - What have you got?
There was no $10 million. There was two and a half in the bags.
The ransom was $10 million. They put it in two bags, 5 million in each bag.
Two bags, true, but one has half paper,
the other only paper.
Maybe your men stole it.
No, no. Whoever did it took it before the exchange.
Okay.
At the Ramos house, before the exchange,
who put the bags into the car?
- Guess what. - What?
Ramos' lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.
- Jordan Kalfus? - Yeah.
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry for the girl.
It was just business, you know?
I'm a professional.
That's what everybody keeps saying: I'm just a professional.
That's what everybody keeps saying: I'm just a professional. Everybody keeps saying that to me. I'm just a professional.
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing it. Do you understand me?
What are you going to do now?
What am I gonna do? Leave. I gotta go.
Go? Hey, come on, come on. What about me?
What about you? You got 40 seconds.
- Come on. - Thirty-five!
Give me a last wish, please, please.
Last wish? I wish...
you had more time.
- Mariana, it's me. - Creasy, where are you?
I got something like banking codes from Bankcoast in the Cayman Islands.
- I need it translated as fast as you can. - Whose account is it?
Jordan Kalfus.
It looks like U.S. deposits and withdrawals. Give me the same thing on Samuel Ramos.
- That's it? - That's it.
Okay.
Creasy.
- Samuel. - Honey?
What's going on?
That's what I wanna know.
What is going on? Sam?
I'm gonna ask your wife a couple of questions, okay? You move...
You make one sound...
and I'll snatch the life right out of you, you understand?
What happened, Lisa?
Were you in on this, or was it just your husband?
- Am I in on what? - You know what.
Pita's kidnapping, her death. Were you a part of it?
- Pita got killed because the ransom... - Shut up!
Yeah, the money was stolen, you're right. The money was stolen by Victor Fuentes.
How much was stolen? Two-point-five million, right? - What are you talking about? - He knows what I'm talking about.
- What are you talking about? - He knows what I'm talking about. - That's what Victor got. - What are you talking about?
Two-point-five million. Two-point-five million to your lawyer, Jordan Kalfus.
He put it in an account in the Cayman Islands, but he won't get to spend it.
What happened to the other five, Sam?
That's 2.5, 2.5. What is five from ten? Five. What happened to the other five?
Tell your wife. This is your chance.
- You got a wife, Creasy? - No, I don't.
You'll never know how hard it is to tell your wife the truth.
No, you have a wife! You tell me what happened!
- It was in this room that my father... - I don't give a fuck about your father!
He prayed for his gambling debts and his infidelities to be forgiven.
- Samuel! - What? - I love you! Tell me the truth! - I didn't inherit a kingdom! That's the truth!
You wanna know the truth? I inherited his debt and his mess!
- Tell me what happened to my baby! - I inherited his lawyer!
Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Be a fucking man!
Jordan told me she'd sit in a room and watch cartoons all day.
And she'd eat ice cream.
And we'd have her back in two days. He lied to me!
That's why he's fucking dead. I did it!
I did it, Lisa!
I agreed to the kidnapping.
I did it for us. For the three of us.
I'm so sorry, Lisa.
You kill him.
You kill him, or I will.
You know how they say a...
bullet always tells the truth.
It never lies.
It didn't work for me, Samuel,
but maybe...
maybe it'll work for you.
I'll pray for you.
This is definitely the address from the ATM card.
The PIN number was a great locator.
But there's no one that sounds anything like The Voice.
Who's that?
He's the man,
The Voice.
My guys got into the house...
on the pretext of giving cholera shots.
We had to inject the whole barrio.
We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.
Now it's time to pursue him.
We have to put his photo in tomorrow's newspaper.
If you value your life,
you won't publish those photos.
- Mr. Creasy? - Yeah, it's me.
I traced the PIN for you and I have an address. Yeah?
The cardholder is Reina Rosas Sanchez, the wife of "The Voice."
She lives in Los Arcos, apartment 26D, via Appia.
- Good. - And another thing.
In today's paper is a picture of The Voice.
"FEAR HAS A VOICE."
Good. Thank you.
He's in.
What do we do?
Nothing... Nothing.
Out of my house, you son of a bitch!
Stop there!
Get out. The kids out. Now!
Sit down.
Sit down!
Reina Rosas, yes?
Who is this? Who is this?
- Daniel. - Daniel what?
Daniel Rosas Sanchez.
The Voice?
And this is his brother?
What is his name?
What is his name?
Aurelio.
Aurelio Rosas Sanchez, okay.
And you are Daniel's woman, right?
How do you contact him? How do you contact him?
We page him,
and he calls back on his cellphone.
Call him.
There's no signal in here.
We have to go on the roof.
Let's go outside.
Outside.
They're going to get a call.
Be ready to track him.
If we're lucky he'll lead us to The Voice.
Hola, Daniel. - Señor Creasy. - Yeah.
Yeah, I got your family here.
Your brother doesn't look too good.
Yeah, Reina, she's what, about eight months? Yeah?
You wanna negotiate?
The most important thing in life is family. Do you agree?
I agree.
There you are, you have my family.
Well, most of my family.
My wife and I are separated. You know how that is.
Now, tell me seriously, how much do you want?
Your brother wants to speak to you. Here, hold on.
What the hell do you want?
Listen to me! Listen!
I'll take your family apart piece by piece. You understand me? Piece by piece! Shut up!
Piece by piece! Shut up!
I don't want your money.
You understand me? You understand me?
I want you!
I'm listening. I'm listening, Daniel. I'm listening.
I'm listening, Daniel. I'm listening.
All right. I will give you a life for a life.
Whose life? What are you talking about?
Whose life, Daniel? I want you!
I will give you her life. For your life.
And in exchange, I will get my life back.
- What life? Whose life? - The girl's. Pita's.
- Pita's dead! - Creasy!
I'm a businessman. A girl dead is worth nothing. She's alive.
All right.
I want proof of life, you hear me? I want proof of life. I want...
I want the name of her bear. What does she call her bear?
You tell her to tell you to tell me what she calls her bear.
Little one...
What do you call your teddy bear?
Yeah?
Creasy. She calls the bear Creasy Bear.
Remember...
I will give you her life
for your life
and the life of my brother.
Okay.
Okay.
I give you your brother, you give me the girl.
- All right. - Where?
He left the roof. We lost the signal.
We got cut off.
We lost him. We lost him.
Damn.
- Hello? - Lisa, listen to me. Don't hang up.
I think Pita's alive.
I can't take this anymore.
Take the road to Puebla. Get off junction 34, south side.
I'll meet you there in two hours.
So where is she?
She's right over there. You see those two cars out there?
Pita's kidnapper, Daniel...
Here's his brother.
Here.
I'm going up on the bridge to get Pita.
Anything goes wrong, you put it to his head,
you pull the trigger, all right?
You understand?
You don't let him loose
until she's with you, you got it?
And you don't wait for me, okay?
- Yeah. - You'll be all right. You okay?
Yeah.
Creasy!
Creasy!
Creasy!
- You all right? - Yeah. They didn't hurt you?
Hi.
All right, your mother's waiting for you. She's at the end the bridge.
- Okay, you go home. - Okay.
- All right. - Where are you going?
I'm going home too.
I'm going to Blue Bayou.
Hey. I got something for you.
I got the last number too.
I love you, Creasy.
And you love me, don't you?
Yes, I do.
Now, come on, Pita, go.
- Go. Run. - Bye.
- Mom! - Baby, come here! It's okay!
- Mom! - Come on.
Ah, it's nothing.
Does Jenny know?
I'm the man of my house, Tom.
I don't have to hide things from my wife.
I won't tell on you.
I appreciate it.
Try this.
Nicotine's not your problem.
It's your oral fixation.
You just need something else to suck on.
I read it in some magazine.
-What kind of magazines you been reading? -Easy.
A man's gotta be able to have something of his own.
How many shooters you count?
Five, six.
Somebody tipped 'em off.
All I know is, we just lost two whole fucking years of work.
Wanna take a look?
As long as it's just a look.
On three.
Three.
Son of a bitch.
Wait. Tom, backup's on its way.
-Oh! -FBI! Freeze! -Tom! Jesus Ch-- -[gunfire]
No!
John! You all right? Yeah.
Come on. Let's get you…
[John] Did you get him?
[Tom] I got him.
You sure?
He took one in the face.
He's dead. Relax.
Hey, the morgue's full of people who thought they got that son of a bitch.
What are you talking about, John? You sound like you know this guy.
Ah… there's talk the Yakuza hired a rogue independent contractor
to deal with the Triads.
He's supposed to be the best.
Same guy the CIA used in Jakarta that time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Same guy that turned on his handlers
and then killed three agents.
I heard it was five.
It's a bullshit story, John. You know that. All right?
Rogue's a phantom. He's a myth.
Somebody at the agency's yanking your chain.
Titanium shells, depleted uranium bullets.
It's his signature.
Do you really think Rogue was working for Yakuza?
That's the trouble with this business.
You never know who's working for who.
[Man] This is the San Francisco police.
Remain where you are with your hands in the air.
Yep. He's right here.
He's right here, John.
Hey. Yeah. See you soon. Okay. Bye-bye.
[in Chinese] You tell him he cannot smoke in front of the kids.
If he's going to smoke he can do it in the yard.
Hao. [in English] Okay.
Okay.
[in English] I thought he was quitting, anyway.
I thought he was, too.
[John] Yo, Tom. Ohh!
-Gotcha! -Aah! Daniel. Please.
-Honey. Darling, I'm on the phone. -Daniel, come on.
Better be on the road. Game starts in 30.
I'm running a little behind.
Figure if we don't hit traffic, we'll make it up there by halftime.
John.
It's an oral fixation.
Ohh… Hey, go on. Get your coat.
So, uh… how's the case going?
Look, forget about the case.
Enjoy your sick leave.
Any ideas who blew the op?
No. Investigation's underway. So far, zip.
Somebody talked.
Somebody inside… close to us.
Any word on what happened to Rogue?
No. We never found a body.
They dragged that bay for three days, and nothing.
And he's fish food by now.
Okay. Well, it's game day, right?
Yeah, I know it's game day.
Just tell me you haven't forgot the steaks, okay?
No, asshole, I didn't forget the steaks.
Christ, when are you gonna let that go?
Diane asked me to check. Yo, she also asked me to--
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard. No smoking in front of the kids.
Honey, we gotta stop off and get some steaks.
Diane, they here yet?
Please!
Diane. What was that?
Diane?
[Diane] No!
Please!
No!
[screaming] No!
John. John.
Honey.
Honey. Honey.
What the--
Oh, my God.
Stay with Daniel, honey.
Hey, where do you think you're going?
-What the hell happened? -I'm gonna have--
We got three fatalities.
What?
One male, one female, and one child.
Hey, wait a minute, pal. FBI or not…
[Man] Sir.
CSI needs to finish.
We gotta let 'em do their thing.
Sir?
You gotta clear out of here now.
♪ Oh, uh-oh, hey, hey ♪ ♪ Oh-oh, uh-oh, oh, hey, hey, hey ♪
♪ Uh-oh… ♪
-Yes! -Yeah! Come on!
Hey, baby. How you doing?
[in Japanese] Get him!
Kimo!
Kimo!
[in Japanese] Daito, heel.
[in Japanese] What the fuck?
[man in Japanese] Rogue, do you know what Shiro does to traitors?
[in English] Wow. These Japs sure know how to party, huh?
Yeah. Smells like a deli in here.
Oh, shut up, Gleason.
See all this ink?
Japanese Yakuza.
Each one of those rings is supposed to represent
some poor bastard they've killed.
These are some bad-ass characters here.
Yeah? What's that make the people who did this, then?
Make a hole.
Get these people out of here.
And just who the hell are you?
Asian Organized Crime Unit. We'll be taking over from here.
On whose authority!
Mayor, President. Take your pick.
You don't look very Asian to me.
You know, I'm amazed you two
don't have this whole case wrapped up by now.
Check these yet, Einstein?
Yeah. Someone cut the feeds. There's nothing on there.
Agent Crawford.
I found these in the back room.
We found him hiding underneath one of the dead bodies.
He's in pretty bad shape.
Yeah? What's he been saying?
You're kidding me, right?
Who can understand that shit?
These people come into this country,
you'd think they'd at least learn to speak American.
You'd think a couple of cops working a district
that's crawling with Yakuza might learn to speak a little Japanese.
[in Japanese] If they weren't complete fucking idiots.
[in English] Give me a minute here, would you?
[in Japanese] Hi… I'm a cop.
What happened here?
Know what I do when I'm not a cop?
Play doctor.
[in English] Hey! You can't do that!
[in Japanese] If I don't get this shrapnel out…
it will get infected.
I got it. No, it's a bone. Sorry.
No, it's a bone. Sorry.
You want me to go back to my day job?
Give me something to do!
[in Japanese] I want to die… before he comes back.
[in English] Well.
I can see it's gonna be a real picnic working with you.
You aren't working with me.
This is the FBI's case now.
You wanna help, you can take my shirts to the cleaners.
So, what'd he say?
A bunch of Japanese mumbo-jumbo.
Vengeful spirits.
Ghost stories.
Jen?
Yeah. Did I wake you?
It's almost 9:00.
Oh, no. I was working late last night, that's all.
Oh. Well, I just called to remind you
that it's Daniel's first basketball game this Friday.
You forgot, didn't you?
No.
I've just been tied up with work.
-I got a lot on my mind right now. -See ya.
Yeah? So what's it this time?
I've found him, Jen.
Found who?
The guy who killed Tom.
He's back. -I can feel it. -[sighs]
This time, I'm taking him down.
John, it's been three years.
Look, your obsession with this man has cost you our marriage.
Don't lose your son.
Tell Daniel I'll be there.
No, you tell him.
And if you say you're gonna be there, then be there.
Fuck.
For those of you who didn't get to meet last night,
this is Agent Goi.
Just graduated Quantico.
What's his specs?
Marksman.
[Goi] What's so funny?
In other words, you're a spectator.
What about you? D.T.
Defensive Tactics. That's right.
I like to get up close and personal.
Yeah, well, my gun's bigger than yours.
[Crawford] Pick a desk.
We're still getting set up here ourselves.
Back of the bus.
These are all the photos anybody has of Rogue.
Bastard re-cuts his face every six months.
Come on, John, anybody can use titanium shells and D.U. bullets.
The ones we found-- The ones we found last night
match the ones we found three years ago.
Rogue's back.
Okay, but if he works for the Yakuza,
why would he kill Yakuza?
Maybe he's switched sides. Wouldn't be the first time.
What sides are we talking about here?
Shiro Yanagawa.
Runs all Yakuza activity from Japan.
Probably the most powerful man in San Francisco,
and yet he's never even set foot on American soil.
He's half the reason this task force was put together.
Li Chang is the other half.
Unlike Shiro, Chang lives here.
Nice big mansion in Marin.
Thinks he's J.D. Rockefeller or something.
He's a 4-89.
A Triad boss.
Into everything: bribery, extortion, murder, you name it.
Thirty years ago, Shiro butchered Chang's family.
Actually had the balls to fly over to Hong Kong
and wipe out the whole fucking clan.
He spent the next 30 years selling every heirloom in the Chang dynasty
to collectors and museums.
All that's left now is a couple of horses.
Statuettes. Two of 'em. About this big.
Word on the street is that Shiro's looking for a buyer as we speak.
Chang's loss of honor means more than his financial loss.
[Crawford] I don't care about the horses.
I don't care about bloodlines or ancient family feuds.
For the first time in three years, we got a real shot at getting Rogue.
All we have to do, ladies and gentlemen,
is pull the fucking trigger.
She's a very rare breed.
Andalusian.
That's my wife Maria.
In my father's day, such a union would not have been possible.
But times change.
Those of us who change with it… survive.
Come.
I am really impressed, Mr. Shaw.
Now that you have spilled the blood of my enemies…
let's drink to our new partnership.
I have to admit…
I was somewhat skeptical
when you first came to me with your proposal.
But leaving Shiro's service,
that was a wise move on your part.
But it makes me wonder.
How could one truly trust a man who has betrayed his master?
I have no master,
so I have betrayed no one.
So, tell me.
My horses, they arrive tonight?
It's been 30 years.
All this time, my family has lived in shame and dishonor,
all because of Shiro's treachery.
Tonight I will take back what was stolen from my family,
and everything will change from here on.
Shiro's men will protect his treasure with their lives.
Are you certain you can deliver them?
I said I would.
These two are the Ti brothers.
They will give you everything you need.
I'll be in touch.
Watch him closely.
[in Japanese] I beg your forgiveness.
[in Japanese] The fault is not yours, but mine.
I left myself unguarded.
[continues in Japanese] I trust you have news from San Francisco.
[in Japanese] Yes, everything is proceeding as requested.
And the Horses?
We've shipped them out.
They will arrive in San Francisco tonight.
You must return to San Francisco in advance of my arrival.
But father…
I don't trust our people there.
They have become too lazy to be useful.
I was hoping to stay here and further my role in the clan.
Nothing in the history of our clan… has ever been more important.
I will not fail you.
Go now. Oversee the sale of the Horses.
[in English] Hey, what's up, dude?
I need to see Benny.
No Bennys here.
Again!
Yeah, hit him!
Hey, what are you doing?
No!
Yeah! Again!
[man] Come on. Oh, ho!
Hey, baby, someone's here to see you.
We need to talk.
Cabrón, I don't talk to the Feds.
Come on!
Somewhere private.
Now.
Tranquilo.
My guy's losing anyway, so…
Come on, come on, come on!
Frankie, I'm paying for this shit! Come on!
Business is good, I see.
Yeah. So much for Homeland Security, right?
So how's the family?
Daniel's fine. But Jen…
that's another story.
You know, I really like her.
I mean, how could you fuck that up?
It wasn't hard.
By the way, thanks for that out there.
Made me look good.
Yeah, I hope it helps.
Yeah, well, the people I'm tracking,
they expect the FBI to pay me some visits like this.
Makes me look legit.
Was that in the Interpol handbook?
Come on, John, there's no science
to catching crooks. You know that.
Well, you said you had something for me.
Yeah.
Our friend over in Brussels?
The guy that make those titanium bullets?
Found him two days ago.
Then I ran a check. It seems everyone ever associated with Rogue
is having some bad luck.
Just last week plastic surgeon down in Panama
accidentally impaled himself with a kitchen knife
making a turkey sandwich.
Week before that, another one of our scalpel friends
down in Florida went skinny-dipping… with some gators. Guess he didn't read the signs.
with some gators. Guess he didn't read the signs.
Anyway. These guys,
Anyway. These guys, they both specialized in facial reconstruction.
Both of 'em.
So the man's tying up loose ends.
Yeah, well, there's another surgeon unaccounted for.
Think he might be still alive, maybe hiding out.
You let me know the second he surfaces.
Thanks, Benny.
[in Chinese] Button up, this isn't a disco.
Is that our contact?
Yes… my contact.
[in English] Get rid of him.
[in English] He's my brother. He's with me.
Who the fuck does this guy think he is?
Go back to your car.
Wu. Please. He's an outsider.
Go. Don't make me say it again.
[in Chinese] After this is done, you and I are going to talk.
[man in Japanese] The Horses are intact. Shira will be pleased.
We'll contact you when we get there.
Are the Horses safe with this crew?
Of course, as far as they know, they're delivering cars.
[in Japanese] Stay calm and cooperate. It's just a routine check.
[in English] I need you out of the car, both of you.
Put your hands where I can see them.
[in English] Officer, we're with Shiro Yanagawa Enterprises.
You're making a huge mistake. We made arrangements.
Out of the car!
Come on. Turn around.
We work security.
We are licensed to carry firearms.
-Call your captain. -Shut up.
-He'll vouch for us. -Shut up.
-[in Japanese] Fucking rent-a-cops-- -[in English] I said shut up!
Evening. Captain Andrews?
What the fuck is going on?
What about our arrangement?
Just a little change in plan.
I need my money… now.
So, we are good to go?
Oh, yeah. You're good to go.
Just wait here for a sec.
Let me and the boys clear out.
Let's go.
Do it.
Oy. Mr. Chang sends his regards.
No!
Compliments of Mr. Chang.
Some serious shit here, brother.
Yakuzas. All of 'em.
All lined up, shot through the back.
Execution style. Excuse me.
Forensics wants to know if you're ready for 'em to come in yet.
It was a heist.
What?
Check the space between these sedans.
These guys were escorting something big.
Whatever it was, it must've been important.
These guys were the guard dogs…
but they left their guns in the cars.
There's only one thing that would have stopped these guys from throwing down.
Cops.
At least they thought they were cops.
Hold on just a damn minute.
Are you trying to say that cops did this?
If they didn't, they were involved.
No fucking way!
For all we know, it could've been one of you guys.
I'm assuming…
that you know who the fuck I am.
You're a bitch for Shiro Yanagawa, aren't you, Captain?
You're the one who gives his boys free passes to smuggle in shit.
And you're the one who sold them out last night.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I've never met Yana--
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
This is a Federal matter.
Look at it.
Look down the barrel.
Tell me if you see the bullet.
-Can you see it? -I see it!
He said he'll kill me.
He said he'll kill my family.
Who? Who said that?
I don't know who!
I don't know who!
He's with the Triads.
He works for the Changs! He knows where I live.
He knows where my kids go to school!
You stupid bastard.
What do you think Shiro Yanagawa's gonna do
when he finds out you fucked him?
Get a statement. Call the marshals.
Put his family under protective custody.
Down! Down! Down! Everyone, down!
-There's a shooter on the roof! -It's him.
Go!
Will, it's Agent Wick. I need Chase Squad backup
and an ambulance to Sloan's Steakhouse now.
Hang on, motherfucker.
Nothing.
This motherfucker's out.
[in Japanese] The Triads made us look like fools.
Kill. Kill them
Give me the word,
and I'll make them disappear.
Do it. Find them.
I want their heads, every one of them.
Hai.
Nobody told me you two were in charge now.
Kira-san. Welcome home.
Kira-san. Welcome home. Your presence honors us.
And your stupidity insults my father.
We were just discussing--
I've brought word from Shira directly.
You are to do nothing until he instructs you to.
The Horses have been stolen!
If we do not strike back--
Are you disobeying my father?
Good.
I'd like a salad.
I just got off a fourteen hour flight.
I'd like a salad.
Will somebody get me a salad!?
What… What kind?
Chef.
-No blue cheese. -No blue cheese.
Takada…
Hai.
With dressing on the side, please.
Hai.
[whispers in English] Bitch.
Yeah.
Special Agent [distorted] Crawford.
Who is this?
A messenger.
Messenger, huh?
The police captain in the restaurant,
was he part of your message?
[distorted] He was a crooked cop.
I just did what you wanted to do.
What the hell do you know about what I want, you fuck?
I saw it in your eyes, John.
Yeah? What did you see?
Pain.
Rage.
Loneliness.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't we meet in my shrink's office and discuss it?
You want the stolen shipment?
Warehouse 16.
One hour.
Remain where you are and keep your hands above your heads.
What? Not happy to see us?
This is private property.
[Wick] R.S.V.P.
We came to party, baby.
Li Chang.
You still pretending to be legit?
Watch your mouth.
You forget who you're talking to here.
Open it.
I said… open it.
Open it!
Put your hands on the back of your head!
-[Crawford] Now, you motherfucker! -[laughs]
Get your fucking hands up.
No weapons. He's clean.
"Victor Shaw."
So that's what you call yourself now, huh?
Hong Kong passport and a security license out of Tokyo.
Run it.
Check the warehouse. Make sure nothing's hidden.
It's you, isn't it?
I remember your eyes.
There's something real familiar about 'em.
It's the one thing the surgeons can't change, can they?
The eyes.
They did a hell of a job on the rest of you, though.
Wouldn't even know you're the same man.
But you are, aren't you?
I know you are.
So, what's a Yakuza hit man doing working for the Triads?
I know you understand me.
It was you on the phone, wasn't it?
What? Don't remember?
Maybe you remember my partner.
You do, don't you?
Remember his name?
Tom Lone.
Remember his wife, Diane?
His four-year-old daughter Amy?
Remember a cabin in the woods?
A cabin that you burned to the ground,
their bodies still inside?
Remember that?
Do you remember that?
Say it.
Say it.
Say you remember.
Say you fucking remember blowing my partner's goddamn head off!
You will find only pain living in the past.
Crawford, there's nothing here. He checks out.
It's him, Terry.
I fucking know it.
So what if it is? Hmm?
Look, right now we got nothing.
Come on, man. It'll be another day.
All right?
Right now, we wait.
We play it smart.
And we do it right.
Another day.
And on that day, you and I are gonna finish this.
Count on that.
Everyone, move out.
How in the world did you know the FBI were coming?
Experience.
You have impressed me once again, my friend.
As you see,
the FBI has declared war on us.
Well, fuck them.
I trust you have secured my horses?
They're safe.
I still have a lot of work for you to do, my friend.
I think you'd better stay in my house for a while…
keep an eye on things.
Understood.
Oh, Victor.
This FBI guy, Crawford.
He is trouble.
He's chasing ghosts.
No!
Gimme a new one.
I said put up a new one now!
Did I scare you?
Where's your mother?
Do you want to play? We can play tag.
Go find your mother. I have things to do.
What's that?
Wow. Do it again.
Ana.
He's showing me a magic trick.
Why don't you go downstairs and play for Mommy?
But we were playing.
I know, but I'll be downstairs in just a minute, okay?
Bye.
I understand you have business here,
but I am warning you to stay away from Ana.
My husband's work and our family are two separate things.
Do we understand each other?
Yes, Mrs. Chang.
Good.
Don't think I don't know what you are doing.
Mr. Chang might think you're his man right now.
But I am still the one
who looks after things around here.
At every moment in the world, things change.
"Don't make me say it again," he fucking tells me.
Relax.
What the fuck?
Motherfucker!
Fucking Yakuza! Let's go!
[man in Chinese] …teach that fucking Jap a lesson!
[in Japanese] Triads are coming!
[in Japanese] Triad motherfuckers… get 'em!
[in English] Buddha-heads!
Fucking Yakuza!
You fucking bastard!
I knew I should never have trusted you.
Subtle, ain't it?
It's got Shiro's trademark.
So what now?
Get ready for a war.
Joey Ti, got your ass.
Park, I want you outside Chang's place in Marin.
Daniels, you get Yanagawa Motors.
Kinler, you get Warehouse 16.
Wick, take Goi. Keep an eye on the Sayu Tea House.
I get the new guy, huh?
I think I know how to look through a night scope.
Eyes open, everybody. This shit's going to go down somewhere.
Be ready to move when you get the call.
Binoculars. No night scope.
The authorities are expecting us to retaliate.
We strike now, we risk everything.
What if it was your family?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You forgot?
Once it was my family!
Joey was like a son to me.
Revenge is a must.
But you've got to learn to be patient.
I will allow nothing to put our family at risk.
I want you to do nothing.
Is that clear?
Shiro knows his days are coming to an end.
One thing's for sure:
more blood will be spilled before this is over.
Mr. Shaw,
I want your word that my wife and daughter will be safe.
No harm will come to them.
A man should never give up his honor.
Or the honor of his family.
Keep them.
I don't smoke.
Oh, man.
I didn't know your mom was working tonight.
Keep your eye on the mark, Goi.
Yo, heads up.
Looks like Takada's having a little tea party, huh?
[in English] Now, that's some spicy tuna, huh?
Shit. Get Crawford and call for backup.
It's going down now.
Crawford.
We got trouble.
Wu just showed up, like you said.
-I'm on my way. -Copy that.
Move! Move!
Yo, going in. Cover me.
[in Japanese] This is for my brother.
-[man in English] He's dead! -[man 2] Come on!
-On three. -What?
-Three. -Oh, shit.
-Freeze! -Shit!
FBI! Drop your weapons.
Drop your weapons. Hands on the counter where I can see them!
Closer.
The fuck--
Situation secure. All units stand down and cease fire.
Damn it, Goi, he said cease fucking fire!
Shit.
[whispering] Look. Goi's right there.
We got a shooter, guys.
I got him!
Don't fucking move.
Get the other one.
Fuck you!
In Japan…
you'd be dead.
This isn't Japan.
I said no, no, no, no.
Yes?
Wu and his boys shot up Takada's tea house last night.
What?
Wu Ti?
Uh, are you sure?
I tried to stop them.
God damn it. I told him not to do anything.
He leaves me with no choice.
You've done well.
My father is very pleased.
He now asks one more thing of you.
After I kill Chang, his operation will be destroyed.
What more could Shiro want?
The heads of the wife and child.
Why?
That's the order. There is no why.
You never had a problem killing women and children before.
Would you dare disobey your master?
I have no master.
These are my guards.
They will assist you in this task as you best decide.
If I refuse?
You dropped this.
What is happening, John?
There are men with guns in my front yard.
Just a precaution.
A precaution? For what?
A precaution? For what? What have you gotten us into?
Oh, my God.
It's him, isn't it?
He's coming after us.
It's not gonna happen.
Oh, I'm sorry, Jen--
not just for this, for everything.
I tried to do the right thing…
make a good life for you and Daniel,
to give you the things you needed.
It never had anything to do with what we did or didn't have.
It was the job.
The job always came first.
Even now, even knowing you might be putting us in the same danger
Tom and his family were in.
You know, I'm not even mad at you anymore.
Most days I just feel sorry for you,
for what you've become.
It's Benny.
Say hi to Benny for me.
What you got, Benny?
We found your plastic surgeon.
Welcome home, Dr. Sherman.
Hey, jefe, what's cooking?
Step in here.
Let's have a talk. Come on.
Agent Crawford? Is that--
I don't know anything, really. I don't know anything.
Doc, come on. You kidding me?
Can you explain to me
why one of the world's most brilliant nip-and-tuckers
is hiding out in the slums of Mexico?
What are you, a fucking Nazi war criminal?
Look, I were you, I'd be lapping up that pussy
on South Beach, stretching it out.
Come on now.
Look, I could give a shit about whatever laws you've broken.
That's not why we're here.
I need you to identify this man.
We know what happened to the other two doctors.
We know you could be next.
We can protect you. You don't know him.
Protect me? You can't protect me.
You can't stop him.
You found me here, he can find me here.
I can stop him.
All I need from you is a yes or a no.
Is this Rogue?
Is this Rogue?
We, uh… we-- we used to get…
commissioned…
by the U.S. government,
and we all did a lot of surgeries on him when he was with the CIA.
We changed his face a lot of times.
He, uh, he came to me three years ago.
His face was almost torn off. I just did what I could.
I repaired the muscle, the nerve tissue.
I reconstructed the facial bones.
I never saw him again.
This is what I made him look like.
Look, Doc, we're going to take you with us.
We're going to protect you, understand?
Why don't you go get some things together and we'll go?
-Doc. -Uh-huh?
What? Yeah.
Is it okay if I-- if I--
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead.
You believe in fate, Benny?
Fate? Yeah.
You know, no matter what you do,
You know, no matter what you do, your future's already decided.
I don't know about that.
I always thought your future depends on what choices you make.
I have made all the necessary arrangements.
I will join you as soon as I finish here, okay?
Don't worry.
Okay. I'll be back to walk you out.
I love you.
My crew's gone.
My brother is dead.
You brought it onto yourself.
And how did I do that?
I gave you my trust.
I gave you my loyalty.
I sacrificed everything for you, and this is how I'm treated?
You've got a lot of nerve to talk to me about loyalty.
You're a fucking traitor!
Die!
That piece of shit.
He tells me that he's loyal,
that he's my friend.
I trusted him.
He's right.
He was loyal. He was your friend.
What?
Holy shit.
AOC base from Clark.
We've got some major action at the Chang mansion.
[in Chinese] What's going on? Is the boss okay?
No!
Chang is dead.
And the woman and child?
Take me to the bodies so I can take their heads.
No. I killed them.
I should have that honor.
Mommy?
Keep your eyes closed, okay?
Where's my husband?
-Where's Clark? -He's on his way back.
He send the photos?
Yes, sir.
What the fuck happened out there?
[Goi] Looks like Rogue took out Chang and turned on Shiro's assassins.
He's using them,
playing both sides against each other.
[Goi] Why would he do that?
John, you're never going to believe who just flew in.
[in Japanese] Father, I'm so happy to see you.
[in Japanese] And, I am happy to see you.
[in English] This country looks very beautiful.
[in English] Your English is improving.
Ha ha! I have been practicing.
This is my new home, after all.
[in Japanese] Rogue insisted on delivering the Horses himself.
[in Japanese] You've made me very proud.
I must ask one more thing of you.
Anything.
Return to Japan.
But I want to stay with you.
If I am to oversee the expansion here,
I need someone who can ensure our interests in Japan.
The only person I can trust is you, Kira.
[in English] Shiro Yanagawa.
FBI Special Agent John Crawford.
[in Japanese] Step back.
[in English] Welcome to America.
Don't unpack. You won't be staying long.
[in English] Agent Crawford, I'm a busy man.
We got a lot of business, you and me.
I think you know that.
Three years ago, Rogue killed my partner and his family.
And you know what?
Rogue was working for you.
Ha ha ha. Rogue is a myth, just a rumor.
You think so, huh?
[John] Can't always trust rumors, can you?
Rogue turns around and fucking slices up
the heavy hitters you sent with him.
Now, you got to ask yourself--
Now, why would he do something like that?
I've never seen this man before in my life.
Look, I don't care if you fucking slaughter each other
till you're all dead and buried.
Truth is, it makes my job a lot easier.
If I find proof that ties any of this shit back to you,
you ain't never going to see Japan again.
And neither will that pretty little daughter of yours.
Thanks for the tip, Agent Crawford.
[in English] Finally,
my most loyal stranger,
we meet face-to-face.
Yanagawa-san, I've waited a long time for this moment.
It's all because of you
that we now have this opportunity.
Kira enjoyed working with you here.
One day she will make a fine leader of the Yanagawa clan.
Yeah. One day.
I am reminded of the Sengoku…
when the daimyo warriors fought each other to unite Japan,
the one who finally succeeded was a man by the name of Oda Nobunaga.
And do you know how he did it?
He killed everyone who opposed him.
Thanks to you,
all those who oppose me here are dead.
I exist but to serve you.
In Asia, these could never be sold.
But the fortune they will bring here in the West
will be more than enough to continue our American expansion.
And now it is time for your reward.
Open it.
One must remove all future threats.
You allowed a threat to remain
by not killing the woman and child.
You have disobeyed me
and broken my most sacred code.
Your code, not mine.
Betrayal cannot be forgiven.
[in Japanese] Take him downstairs.
Persuade him to tell us where the wife and child are.
[in Japanese] They are truly magnificent.
So many deaths for such small trinkets…
Fakes!
[in Japanese] Find me the woman and child. They'll lead us to the real horses.
[in English] After all these years,
why do you do this?
You ordered the hit.
I ordered many hits.
This one was different.
You should have left the wife and daughter alone.
No!
I left none to seek revenge.
You left one.
Your assassin, Rogue, never made it out alive.
So…
you're Tom Lone.
Changing your face, your voice…
all so you could get to me.
Pain can be a weapon, if you so choose.
How do you think we found out you were FBI in the first place?
It was Crawford.
You killed my family.
It was Crawford.
He's the one who gave you up.
Crawford worked for me.
Because of him, your family's dead!
Somebody talked.
Someone inside, close to us.
You never know who's working for who.
Somebody talked.
[Goi] Crawford?
Shiro's dead.
Get out of this business while you can, Goi.
[in Japanese] From America? Leave me.
MAKE A NEW LIFE
Crawford.
Remember the night we met?
I remember my partner blowing your face off.
You live today only because of what he did.
I live today only to kill you, you miserable prick.
Meet me there.
Goi.
Where are you?
Show yourself!
I got your surgeon.
He made a positive I.D.
Come on, Crawford, flush him out.
It's over, Rogue.
You hear me?
Why did you do it?
What did Shiro promise you that was worth my life
or the lives of Diane and Amy?
-No. -[gasping]
You're not him.
It can't be.
You don't even sound like him.
Look at my eyes, John.
The one thing the surgeons can never change.
Jesus, Tom.
Is it really you?
Yeah.
Why didn't you tell me?
It was the only way I could get the man responsible.
But all along,
I never thought it would bring me back to my best friend.
I didn't know they'd send Rogue.
For Christ's sakes, I thought he was dead.
They said they wanted to teach you a lesson
for shooting Rogue:
just rough you up a bit, that's all.
Is that what they told you?
Shiro ordered everything.
I tried to stop working for him…
to get out so many times.
I thought if I could make that son of a bitch pay for what he did to you,
somehow it would make things right again.
You think you can forgive me, Tom?
Tom Lone is dead.
My name is Rogue.
Time of day, 6:14 a.m.
Interview with informant resumes.
Please restate the names of these two men.
[informant] Hector Álvarez. Adrian Lovell.
-You introduced them? -[informant] Yes.
You brokered an arms deal between them?
[informant] Yes.
And you were in a relationship with both of them?
[Informant] Yes.
[FBI Agent 1] All right. Okay.
Help me get the food chain right.
Hector Álvarez was supplying Adrian Lovell with weapons.
What kind of weapons?
[informant] This place isn't secure.
Lady, stop telling us our jobs. We can take you in if you want.
-You don't know how bad this gets. -[FBI Agent 1] Then tell us.
Here.
Look, I get that this is dark,
so why don't we start with the weapons Álvarez is supplying?
Soviet PKM machine guns, LAWS rocket launchers,
M18 claymore mines.
It's not the point.
[FBI Agent 1] Actually, it is.
They want you dead for what you know, right?
We need to talk about my deal.
I'm sick of the bridge tournament this bitch is playing.
If you need our protection--
You wouldn't know the first thing about protecting me.
Hey. You're safe here.
No, I'm not.
[FBI Agent 2] Álvarez is in Cuba, Lovell's under surveillance.
We've had a tail on him since the second he landed at O'Hare.
-Then he knows where we are. -[chuckles softly] Let me tell you--
You think you're following him? He's following you.
If you think you're gonna dictate how we conduct an interrogation, -I don't know who you-- -[silenced gunshot]
-I don't know who you-- -[silenced gunshot]
Agents down, shooter outside.
Hawthorne? Carter? Do you copy?
Are we breached? Do you copy?
[mouthing] Come.
-Not the window, don't-- -[silenced gunshot]
-No, let me get-- -Shh!
[FBI Agent 1] Am I gonna die?
I don't know.
I know you're in there.
Did you think you could hide from me?
You must have known I'd find you.
Adrian.
No.
[nurse] It's a girl.
[Mother] Is she okay?
[nurse] She's perfect.
Gimme the room.
Special Agent Williams.
How are you?
-Where's my baby? -She's in the nursery.
She was very fortunate.
I wanna see her.
Well, what you want is no longer the deciding factor in what happens next.
You wasted 12 hours of FBI time trying to cut a deal for yourself
and seven agents were killed.
This conversation now takes place on our terms.
You can't keep her from me. I'm her mother.
What you are to that child right now is a death sentence.
Adrian Lovell and Hector Álvarez represent ruthless business interests.
If you leave here with that child, they will kill her.
Lovell already stabbed a pregnant belly.
What would he do to a live child?
Adrian Lovell is dead.
Lovell was extracted from the house fire before backup arrived.
His body was never accounted for. [sighs]
Your daughter will be placed in witness security…
My daughter is not going into the foster system.
…so no one knows who her mother is.
You underestimate my ability to protect my child.
Yeah, well, I'm aware.
Back-to-back tours in Iraq and Afghanistan,
46 confirmed kills, accurate to 1,300 meters with an M24.
Tell me how that helps her.
You and I both know the only way you protect that child is to disappear.
[voice breaking] And if I don't?
They'll find you. Both of you.
And just so you know,
the FBI has a terrible record of protecting the whereabouts of people
who caused the death of federal agents.
Termination of parental rights. Sign when you're ready.
-Let her in. -[man] You sure?
She's good.
Hey.
They just told me.
You all right?
Three things.
One, you put her with good people.
I want her to have the most boring, stable life there is.
It's a girl?
Two, you let me know she's safe,
every birthday.
Three,
if there's trouble…
you let me know.
I owe you that.
[man] Is she yours?
No.
Don't sneak up on somebody with PTS--
Well, now I'm really fucking triggered.
[man] You'll need a job.
Some of the ranchers would pay good money for shooters like you.
Get rid of the wolves.
I don't wanna shoot wolves.
You found God or something?
No.
It's good. Thanks.
-If you want-- -I don't want anything, Jons.
Hey. We're all lost when we get out.
I got more than lost.
Whatever you've done, you're still here. Still time to make it right.
Anybody sees us in town, you don't know me.
It's that bad?
Another birthday.
Let's see how big she got.
It's not her birthday.
[Mother] She's in trouble?
We gonna say hello first?
Hello.
Civilization is built on the little things.
Tell me what's going on, Cruise.
ATF busted some of Hector Álvarez's men at a stash house in Nuevo Laredo.
Typical stuff. MK12s, you know, bump stocks, silencers.
But they also had this.
The six men are in custody in Mexico.
-We wanted you to ID them. -[scoffs]
You didn't bring me here for a lineup.
I keep my promises.
-I will protect her. -Can't advise you on that.
What's her name?
You can tell me her name now.
Her name is Zoe.
It's Greek for "life."
-[woman] Okay, that was close. Almost. -Almost!
Hey, there.
I know you.
-[woman] Hey! -[man 2] Come on!
[Zoe] Please, stop! Mom!
Zoe!
-[tires screeching] -[woman] No!
-You okay? -Go! Drive!
You knew this was coming. You should've had people.
I couldn't know how or when. I couldn't know what Hector was--
And you couldn't set up a standard perimeter?
Obviously that was beyond what I expected. That was Hector's top lieutenants.
Yes, Yanil Gonzalez, the one who grabbed her.
Tarantula.
There's a change of clothes next to you.
-[exhales heavily] -I made you three promises.
I kept them all and did what I could to keep her a secret.
Well, the secret's out.
Whose clothes are these, some desk cop?
They're my sister's.
We have a team setting up at the house. We'll wait for a ransom call.
-There won't be any call. -What do they want?
Me.
They can have a nice, long look at me while I kill every last one of them.
And then what?
Then I get the kid back to her parents.
They did a good job.
Bathroom?
She's using the facilities.
[officer] Secure the backyard.
[Cruise] Any guesses where we're going?
Straight back to Cuba.
We're married?
Great place for a honeymoon.
-[in Spanish] Throw away the gun. -Calm down.
Where's the girl?
What's he done with her?
Count those tiles. He's a cheater.
-Shut up, old woman! -I won't shut up!
[Tarantula] Stop that bitch!
Get the hell out of my house!
-[engine revving] -[in English] Cruise!
-[grunts] -[man 1] Son of a bitch!
-[car horn blares] -[Cruise] Move!
[yells] You fucked up my car.
[in English] Put him in the trunk.
[in Spanish] What about the girl?
Where's the girl?
[in English] I'm asking the fucking questions!
-[in Spanish] Where's the girl? -[Cruise] I don't think he knows.
-[in Spanish] What'd he say? -[in English] Want me to tell? Let me translate.
So this is how you interrogate.
[in Spanish] What happened?
You get tired?
Hector's whore.
[in English] Okay. Okay. Okay.
-[laughing] -Hey.
[Mother] Hector wants me there, right?
But I'm not going in blind. [breathes heavily]
Hold him back.
[in Spanish] Where you going?
You gonna kiss me? Huh?
[in English] You learn things in the service.
The bubbles sting like hell, right? Now…
[in Spanish] Tell me, asshole.
Where's the girl?
Efila.
-What's waiting for me? -[chuckles]
How many guards?
All of them.
[in English] It's a trap.
I don't care.
As long as we get Zoe, they can have me.
[in Spanish] He doesn't want you.
And the things he's gonna do to her,
she's never gonna forget.
[Cruise, in English] We gotta go.
Here, let me help.
So, you're not just barbed wire around a fist.
I'm whatever I need to be to keep her safe.
Including turning yourself into a ghost.
Feel that?
You could've let me die, but you didn't.
You saved me.
Why?
You gave me water.
At the safe house.
It's like you knew I was thirsty all the time.
You were taking care of me and my baby.
Felt like a man worth saving.
How'd you get involved in all this shit?
You and Lovell and Álvarez.
I don't get it.
Afghanistan.
I want those targets on fire!
[Mother] Lovell was ex-SAS, training my sniper unit.
The trick is to perform when suffering.
[Mother] I guess I stood out.
500 meters, even your heartbeat will throw you off target.
Of course he picked me.
No family, no future.
Nothing to lose.
-So, you're a headhunter. -[Adrian] Not exactly.
This war's an addiction.
All it creates is chaos, suffering, and people who need things.
I'm just a man who can get those things.
For whose side?
A three-star general, an Uzbek warlord…
Powerful people want things… that aren't on the menu.
I should've run the other direction.
So why didn't you?
What else was I gonna do after the service?
I was the best,
and the best that I could hope for was being a cashier at a retail chain.
[Mother] Adrian was offering more than that.
But you didn't take it.
Did a tour in Guantanamo instead.
[Mother] I wasn't gonna be his employee.
I waited until I had something to bring to the table.
Álvarez.
Eighteen months in a guard tower tends to sharpen the focus.
Hector.
[Mother] Hector was siphoning guns off the base under everyone's noses.
Not mine.
-I saw him for what he was. -And what was that?
My retirement plan.
Hector's guns. Adrian's network.
The potential was obvious.
My problem is I've got an entire armory
of Hector's stolen munitions in that harbor,
and I gotta make sure those weapons find a good home.
I've got the perfect home, but your repartero boyfriend
is trying to raise the price you and I agreed on.
Somebody's been studying their Cuban slang.
I've been taking orders my whole life.
And it felt good to be in control.
I bet you he's a better dancer than you are.
It was almost too easy.
Until I was pregnant.
And things turned…
without me seeing it.
There's more money than we thought. I did good.
Why is there more money?
[Álvarez] This dude has very powerful friends, like you said,
so sometimes they want things that are not on the menu.
[Mother] They were hiding something.
I had to find out for myself.
And then you called us.
Whose is she?
If you don't mind me asking.
She's not Hector's.
And she's not Adrian's.
She's mine.
Let's go.
-In position. -[Cruise] Copy.
[Mother] Four on the west side.
I see them. Another two out front. Hector's moving up in the world.
No. Adrian handed him this place and he let it rot on the vine.
She's in there somewhere.
Access clear.
Kill the power. Now. Now.
I've got eyes on her. Get in position.
Come with me now.
Give me your hand. Come on.
-Who are you? -It doesn't matter.
[screams] Help!
I am helping.
You're hurting me.
I got her. We're on our way.
Jesus, my arm!
Shh, you stay right here. You stay right by my side.
Heading to you in ten seconds.
William!
[Cruise] It's okay now.
It's okay. It's all right. Hey.
Let me look at you. Okay?
Let's go.
I'm not finished.
[Álvarez, in Spanish] Lower the gun…
[in English] Throw it out of the window.
Throw it!
[in Spanish] Hands up.
Turn around.
Turn.
Yes. Slow like that.
So hot…
[in English] You sold your soul to the devil. How come you still look so good?
Why get that little girl involved?
She's not that little.
You're not getting away this time.
You're in my universe.
This is my castle.
Must be a nice life.
You need a dozen people to guard you while you sleep.
They're all gone, by the way.
Well, then they died for a good cause…
because I dream about this.
Actually, my dick gets hard thinking about this.
You should've thought about that more back in the day.
Coño. You're gonna go that low?
Let me ask you, then…
Is the little girl…
-Is she mine? -Does it matter?
No. No, what matters is that you sold me out.
That you shit on everything we built.
Are you going to pay me back now?
I have this dream…
where I make you beg…
and scream.
Do you remember the games we used to play?
There's no safe word now.
We can do it for real.
I'm gonna watch you die like an animal.
You don't have the balls.
No?
-[exclaims softly] -Try me.
I'm gonna get you real turned on. Then I'm going to split you in half.
Do you remember the safe word?
We never had a safe word.
So, I think she's bouncing back. Talked to her mother.
Pancakes will be on the table when we arrive.
This is for Zoe. Thanks.
Thanks.
Thank the FBI. Cruise got it for you.
You'll be okay from here.
You know, they have…
services and counseling and people to talk to.
Where are you going?
Cruise will be out soon. You should wait in the car.
Are you my mother?
No.
[Cruise] So that's it? You're just gonna vanish again, huh?
She's 12. Just let her go be a kid.
Let this all just be a bad memory.
Hey.
Stay in touch.
We got about six more hours, so if you wanna take a nap, be my guest.
Why won't she just admit it?
What's that?
That she's my mother.
Zoe, let's just get you back to your real family, okay?
[doctor, in Spanish] Look, here is the head.
And this
is the heart.
Do you see it?
[in English] Not too far now.
Tonight, you get to sleep in your own bed.
How about that?
[Zoe] That sounds really nice.
[Cruise] Yeah. You and your BFF still getting along?
-[Zoe] BFF? -[Cruise] Ain't that what you call it?
William… William… William…
Goodness me.
Now, where is your mother?
Lower the gun.
Get behind me.
Look at the mess you made.
Do you know this man?
Who is he?
Someone from child welfare? Social Services?
Oh, no.
Not with that standard FBI holster.
-No! -Run!
Zoe! Zoe!
Here you go.
When am I going home?
Look, you saw what was out there.
That's gonna keep coming.
The feds can protect your parents,
but they can't protect us. Nobody can.
So we just keep moving and cover our tracks.
Who were they?
You don't need to know.
Bad people, that's all.
Well, what do they want from me?
You're a chip, something to bargain with.
I can't explain it to you at your age.
You're a kid. It'll scare you.
[sarcastically] Better not do that.
I forgot, I… This is for you.
Where are we going?
Far.
Go use the restroom.
-Ma'am? -For the truck.
-Hello? -I called to tell you that she's safe.
-Let me talk to her, please. -She can't.
-What did you say? -She can't come back to her life yet.
Not yet.
What does that mean?
No, I… I don't understand.
I don't understand any of this, so explain to me what that means.
-You'll have to trust me. -Are you serious?
I promise that she's just--
No, he promised me you would never come back.
I'm talking about Agent Cruise. They told me what happened.
Did you see it happen?
Yes.
Did she see it too?
[quietly] Yes.
Hey, I need a minute. Need a minute. I can't--
Hey.
I will get her back to her home. Okay? Back to you.
As soon as it's safe.
Guess that's not a date I can put in my calendar.
Her birthday's in October.
-I know that. -Of course you do.
Look, Cruise kept his promises,
I keep mine.
You'll see her blow out another candle.
You have my word.
-Get in. -No, where's my phone?
Get in the truck.
I need my phone.
You need to get in the truck.
A nice-looking young lady you got.
Thanks, we're just passing through.
Oh, that's a pity.
If you were here a while, you could take a look at the salmon run.
It's just fish swimming upstream, laying their eggs to die.
Not very romantic, looking at it that way.
You must be doing some hunting.
Dall sheep?
Caribou?
Grizzlies.
You might wanna stock up too.
What is it, Halloween? Put those back.
Sir, she'll pay for that.
It's on the house.
Enjoy the great outdoors.
[Zoe] You knew that guy, right?
What?
Why are you pretending you don't know each other?
Because we don't.
Strangers don't talk like that.
It was like…
spies or something, talking in code.
Put these on.
We're going to eat.
-It's beautiful. -Shh.
No! No! [gasping] No.
Let's go.
-Eat. -I can't.
Yes, you can.
Not eating Bambi's mom.
That's not venison.
The deer has to hang for the meat to tenderize.
Besides, that was a stag,
so it would be Bambi's dad.
-What is this, then? -Rabbit.
Thumper.
Not eating a rabbit either.
[sighs] Listen to me,
that rabbit had a better life than any cheeseburger you ever ate.
He had a beautiful life until you shot him.
-I trapped him. -Much better.
Let me tell you something, kid.
There's nothing you ever ate that didn't come from violence.
Tofu.
Half of Paraguay was burned and deforested for soy plantations.
Cheese.
Those cows are impregnated just so they can be pulled on all day.
-Gross. -Hmm.
Cashew cheese.
I know a mercenary in the Ivory Coast, said they fought a civil war
over cashews.
I wanna go home.
I know you do.
Eat.
Meet me outside in five minutes.
You're driving.
I'm 12.
So I'll teach you.
Why?
You wanna go home?
I want that too.
But not till you know how to survive, everything it takes.
And this is where we start.
What, you hate me?
Good. Use it.
'Cause you're gonna work harder than you ever thought you could.
Then you'll run out your reserve tank and find you had more,
and you'll run that out too.
But when it's done, you're gonna drive outta here yourself.
What's the matter, scared?
Yes, very.
Then do this.
Put the key in the ignition.
Yeah. Turn it over. Turn it.
Here, pull this down.
Forward and down. Ready? Go.
Get your rifle up. You don't get to catch your breath.
We do this so you can think when you're exhausted.
Head up, eyes ahead.
Chamber.
-Focus. -[panting]
Breathe out.
-Shoot. -[gun fires]
Again.
-Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! -[pups yipping]
Do you wanna come play? Of course you do.
Hi! Hi! Oh, my gosh.
They're not pets. Nothing out here is.
How close is she?
Right behind you.
-Run! -[pups whimpering]
Shh, it's okay. It's okay.
You shot the mom!
No. No, look. The green ones are just salt shells.
Just good for scaring something off.
See?
Come on.
Don't ever put that in your mouth again. It's not for you. You don't do that.
-You do it. -[gun clatters]
You're not me. You hear me?
-You're not me. -I don't wanna be you.
I wanna go home.
I hate it here.
-[breathing heavily] -Put it down.
No. I'm leaving. You're not stopping me.
Look at you shake.
-You're not ready. -I am ready.
Prove it.
Don't make me--
Why are you such a bitch?
Don't you call me a bitch! Don't you ever call me a bitch!
Keeping you safe doesn't make me a bitch.
-Lying to me does. -How am I lying?
I know who you are.
That's not lying. That's just not talking about things that don't matter.
Besides, you already have a good mom.
I miss her so much.
I miss her and my dad, and I'm not allowed to talk to you about anything
if it's not how to gut a fish or how to field dress a duck!
I'm serious.
Field dress a duck?
I can't talk to you.
I can't ask any questions.
Zoe.
The answers are tough.
So?
There's things in this world you don't need to know yet.
What things?
Please.
I'm here.
Whatever the question, that's your answer.
And it's the only one I got.
Open it.
You have to practice, get the timing right.
If you grip too soon, you cut yourself.
Give me your arm.
A knife fight means your enemy's close.
You can't hit him just once.
You can never stop hitting him until he can't hit back.
That's how you protect yourself.
You just keep hitting him again and again and again, just…
You're scaring me.
Every time I look at you, I'm scared.
You? You don't feel anything.
Well, it's the only way to survive.
[Mother] Nine o'clock.
Ten o'clock.
Eleven o'clock.
Twelve o'clock.
Do you ever miss William?
Agent Cruise?
I do.
Did you love him, then?
-I never got a chance to find out. -But maybe?
Maybe.
Maybe's something.
For me, maybe's a lot.
You gotta be careful now.
You hear me? Remember where they are.
[Zoe] What happened to her?
She's hurt.
[Zoe] We have to help her.
It's nature. You can't change it.
But her cubs aren't old enough to hunt on their own.
Well, if she dies, they'll have to learn.
Or they won't.
You can't change it either way.
Zoe?
Zoe! Zoe!
[Zoe] Do it again. Good boy! That's a good boy.
-[pups whining, barking] -Hey.
Here. You guys want some food?
You guys want some food? I have some food.
Here. Come here. Come here.
-Watch out! -[screams]
-[sobbing] -Let me see. [pants]
Okay. Okay.
Oh, yeah. Let's get you stitched up.
We'll get started on her. You're her mother?
There's some paperwork on the counter. Come on. This way, sweetie.
It's not too bad. Only took eight stitches.
I'm gonna send the nurse in with some aftercare instructions.
Zoe here is a brave girl.
Get your coat on.
[Zoe] I didn't know I wasn't supposed to tell him my real name.
[Mother] No, I should have told you.
She gave her name. They put it in the computer.
I can't risk it. You have to take her.
Just give her this when it's all over.
I hate you!
-[Mother on phone] How many? -[Jons] It's a full platoon.
She won't be safe till they're all gone. Do you see him?
Not sure. I'll take Zoe and go.
Well, tell her that I said I'm sorry that I lied about you and me.
[Jons] About what?
-She'll know. -[line disconnects]
Where am I going now?
We're taking a trip back to the lower 48.
Don't talk in code to me too.
Fair enough.
I don't know. And that's the truth.
We run until we get the word.
How do you know her?
We served together, a long time ago.
I'm not much good in a fight anymore, though.
And even if I was, I suspect she'd still want me right here,
making sure that you're safe.
She won't even admit she's my mother.
A woman like that,
you gotta pay attention to what she does, not what she says.
And all she lives for is you.
[Mother] Dear Zoe.
When I left you in the hospital, it was not the end of me caring about you.
Every decision I've made has been for you.
The only thing that gave me any peace was knowing you were safe.
I'm a killer. You know that now.
But I'm also a mother, and I will die protecting you.
For all my mistakes,
you are the one good and beautiful thing that I have done with my life.
You are a marvel.
Someone tried to kill you before you were born,
and you didn't just live, you flourished.
When you look in the mirror, remember it's a sign that you survived.
That you would not let anyone or anything erase you.
I have shown you my love in the only way I know how.
When the time comes for you to use what I've taught you,
don't hesitate to take your place in this world.
Love always, your mother.
Zoe. We gotta go.
-[radio static crackles] -This is the kill zone.
Treat this as you would Basra, Brega,
or Damascus.
Treat her as you would a hundred snipers.
I'm the one who kills her.
And I kill her close.
She's got the woods mined.
Proceed with caution. I repeat, proceed with caution.
Time to send her a message.
-Check for the girl's remains. -[radio static crackles]
[man 2 on radio] I see a little girl driving a truck, south road.
Converge on the south road. Get me the girl.
[Mother] Zoe!
Jump!
-Here. Put this on. -[panting]
They're coming.
-No. -I can do it.
You can track. I pull the trigger.
[Zoe] I see one. He's on foot.
Range 658.
Hold left side of his head.
-Now. -[gun fires]
[Adrian] Our girl's got potential.
She's so like you.
Meet me two clicks to the left of your position
or I destroy that potential right now.
No! Wait! [panting]
It'll take me two minutes to get down there.
I distract him, you run.
No matter what. You hear me?
-I can cover, I really can. -No.
These have been the best months of my life with you.
No matter what, you run.
Drop your weapons over the side.
And the other one.
The camouflage, too. All of it.
You have the shot, take it!
All in good time.
You burned down our entire world…
…for her.
Yes.
Come on.
See where you're looking?
She's just up there, isn't she?
She's watching.
She's got a shot, eh?
Bullet in your head will take us both out.
Did you teach her to be ruthless? Hmm?
Can she stop her heart like you?
We die and she survives.
If that's what you want,
take a breath and tell her.
Tell her.
Take the shot!
Come on, please. Please come on.
Please, please, please…
-[screaming] -It's okay.
[sobbing] Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please!
Salt.
[panting] Fuck.
No! [sobbing]
Go to your mother.
I love you.
[Mother] I love you too.
Go.
Oh, look at you!
I love you so much.
Oh, my gosh, did you get taller?

I think it's pretty obvious. I'm stealing this jet.

So one of us doesn't know something else, right?

[boy] Reed! Get your ass back here.
[Adam] Ow!
-Got anything else you wanna say? -Actually, I--
-[groans] -Huh? No more jokes?
-Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this. -[Adam] Who talks like that?
Did you order, like, a "Bully Starter Kit" on Amazon or somethin'?
I mean, do you even hear yourself? Chuck, we talked about this.
-I didn't say anything. -Shut up, Chuck.
[man on PA] There will be an assembly in the gymnasium now.
Please proceed to the gymnasium.
Not a word.
-[sighs] -[man] Mrs. Reed--
[Mrs. Reed] See his face?
And, what, you're gonna suspend Adam? Because what?
You think he started a fight with that thug Ray?
Was it Ray Dollarhyde again?
It's barely been a year since we lost his father.
You could show some compassion.
[Adam] It wasn't my fault.
I know you, Adam. I know that mouth of yours.
I know exactly what got you punched.
He was giving me crap in front of the whole class.
-I couldn't just take it. -He's twice your size.
Everyone is twice my size. I've seen babies bigger than me.
-I don't understand you. -Dad would.
What's going on, honey? Can you just tell me?
If I keep having to leave work in the middle of the day,
I'm gonna lose my job.
It's the third time you've been suspended for fighting.
You'd think I'd be better at it by now.
This goes on your permanent record. Get that? Care about your future?
Do you?
Son, you'd better start caring, because the future is coming,
sooner than you think.
[Mrs. Reed] Hey, Adam.
Adam, I'm headed out.
Come and have your dinner.
Where you goin'?
Oh, just out to dinner with a friend.
Which friend?
-His name's Derek. We work together. -You're goin' on a date.
-Not a date. I don't think it's a date. -Your dress thinks it is.
Oh, it is a date. I am going on a date. Why am I going on a date?
Can we please stop saying "date" now? Thanks.
Adam, I'm sorry. We… we should have spoken about this.
I don't know how to handle it. Let's talk about it now.
-Dear God, no. -No! You can have any kind of feeling.
-It's normal. As long as we're a team-- -[phone alert]
Oh! Time to go.
[Mrs. Reed] He texted me?
Well, look at that.
It's a whole new world.
-But we will talk about it tonight, honey. -Mom, wait.
-What? -Turn around.
-Make good choices, okay? -Said the boy who got suspended.
[chuckles] I love you, honey.
I love you too, Mom. More than I know.
[Mrs. Reed] Listen, while I'm out, lock up the back.
No ovens, no answering the door, no video games.
-[rumbling] -[dog whining]
Hawking?
What is it? You see something?
-[whining] -Hawking, stop! Hawking!
[echoing] Hawking!
Whoa!
-[Hawking whimpers] -Oh my God. You scared the crap out of me.
-[rustling] -Who's there?
I don't think we should be out here.
We're okay.
-[barking] -Hawking!
Take it easy.
-Or, you know, fall down and scream. -[clattering]
-Jeez. Who the hell are you? -Put the bat down.
Put the bat down. I'm not gonna hurt you, I promise.
-What are you doing in here? -Mostly bleeding.
[sighs] Wait, how old are you?
-What? -How old are you?
Twelve.
[whispers] Twelve…
Shit!
-How did you get in my dad's garage? -I… It was open.
No, it wasn't. And that is a flight suit. Are you a pilot?
Yeah. Yeah, listen to me. Uh--
Don't-- Hey, don't call anyone. Put the phone down. I won't hurt you.
You said that already.
-Well, it bears-- God damn it! -[squelching]
Uh, it bears repeating.
-[sighs] -That's a lot of blood.
Well… well, I have so much more in my body. Where's your mother?
On a date.
With who?
-What? -With who? What's his name?
-I don't know. Derek? -Derek?
Derek. Derek, Derek, Derek.
That's, yes, the guy with the, um… with the mouth mullet.
-The goatee? -Yeah.
So say goatee.
-Yeah, he doesn't matter. -None of them matter.
Oh, uh…
Nice dog.
I'm gonna go inside the house.
I'm gonna get some stuff.
Hey, careful with that.
-Stay here. -[clattering]
[groans] Come on.
Ah…
[grunts] Told you to stay in the garage.
And let some creepy dude just wander around my house alone?
-Yeah… -I don't think so.
Yeah, believe me. I don't wanna be here any more than you want me here.
I just gotta stop bleeding long enough.
Gotta dress the wound, prevent a nasty infection,
and I will be on my merry way.
Don't touch that.
-I was just looking. -Don't touch my stuff.
-Is this a lightsaber? -No, it's not.
-Okay. -No. Enough with the bat!
-[clattering] -If I wanted to hurt you, I would have.
If I'm being honest with myself, you have a very punchable face.
-Oh my-- -God! That--
Gah! That bullet went straight through. Good.
-Cool. -Wait, wait, wait. Bullet? You were shot?
Yeah-- No, actually, no.
No, I was stabbed with a bullet. What do you think, you moron?
-I'm a moron? You're the one who was shot. -All right, okay, that's it. [coughs]
-[farting sound] -That… Wow… That, uh…
That's weird. It farts when I cough.
-[coughs] -[farting sound]
-Gross. -Super gross.
I'm gonna go upstairs, grab some stuff. Stay cool. You can trust me.
Easy for you to say. I'm the one who ends up in a therapist's office,
telling them about where the bad man touched me.
Oh God! That's where you go? Immediately? You are dark, man.
-[young Adam] Who even are you? -That is classified.
Why are you here?
-Also classi… classified. -Are you in the air force?
When I say "classified," what does your brain hear? Chocolate?
-What's with the lightsaber? -It's not a lightsaber.
Jesus Christ, Adam.
-I need you to play it cool. -Wait.
-I know playing it cool isn't your thing. -Wait.
-It never has been-- -Wait, wait! How do you know my name?
You're Adam Reed. Born February 10th, 2010.
Your parents are Ellie and Louis Reed. Louis would've died about a year ago.
You don't play any sports because of acute asthma.
-Plus you're freakishly small for 12. -[frantic barking]
You go to Franklin Middle School,
where you've been suspended two, three times for fighting,
which is ironic because you can't fight to save your life.
[in unison] Hawking! Zip it!
How do you know my dog's name?
Because I named him.
-Where are you goin'? -[gasps]
-[wheezing] -Oh God.
[shakes inhaler] All right.
Here, ready? Deep breath.
Hold it.
Three, two, one.
Everybody gets a trophy.
When I was seven,
I ran into a table on the patio.
I got 12 stitches.
[in unison] Right here.
You knew how to get into my dad's garage.
You knew how to close the fridge.
You knew how to time my breathing.
We have the same scar.
And you're wearing my dad's watch.
This watch.
This watch.
You're me.
Holy shi--
That's classified. But yes…
I once was.
-[coughs] -[wound farts]
I can't believe you're future me.
Okay, you came to terms with that pretty quickly.
It's a little disturbing, actually.
-So why are you here? -Rescue mission.
I wasn't supposed to land here. I was aiming for 2018.
-I need to get there as soon as possible. -Who were you trying to save in 2018?
Really?
Fine. Can you at least tell me how you got here?
I'll show ya.
What was that?
-Crap. -What?
Uh, we're gonna switch to plan A, which is where you come in.
You see, time jets, like all tech in the future,
is coded to its user's DNA.
Because I'm injured… aah, the jet won't even clear me to fly,
which means I can't get in there to fix her.
But guess who can?
There she is.
[Adam] Away we go.
Okay. Sit down.
-Oh my God. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sit down.
Let's see what we're dealing with here. All right, some minor shield damage.
-Coolant leaks. -[beeping]
I don't know what that is, but when is a flashing red light ever good?
Ah-da-da-da-da-da.
I know you wanna touch all the pretty buttons
with your sticky little child fingers, but the reactor has a quantum signature.
You fire it up, they can find us.
If they're here.
Who are "they"?
I'm glad that you didn't ask me that because "they" are classified.
-I already know you're from the future. -Believe me, I regret that.
I had no intention of coming back to revisit… this.
Jesus. Okay.
Okay, I've isolated the damaged relays,
so the ship should be able to start repairing itself.
How long will that take?
Ah, it's at 50% capacity,
so hopefully less time than it takes me to heal.
[young Adam] Wait.
-Do you remember this? -Remember what?
This. Right here, right now.
You being here in 2022?
-Know where you're going with this. -If this is happening to me--
-You're wasting your time. -That means it already happened to you.
Unless it works like a multiverse,
where each ripple creates an alternate timeline--
It's not a multiverse!
My God, we watched too many movies.
I just wanna know.
Okay.
Okay, the prevailing wisdom is that when I go back to my fixed time,
my memory… our memories, they reform, they reconcile.
-But not while I'm here. -Fixed time? What's that?
There's only one place in time where you belong on a quantum level,
where you're not screwing around with the cosmos like I am.
That is your fixed time.
Where you actually belong.
So by being here and telling me this,
you may have just changed my whole future?
Honestly? Your future is pretty tragic either way.
[laughs] I'm kidding! I'm kidding.
I'm not kidding.
I'm kidding. Let's go. Come on. Here we go.
[young Adam] So what happens now?
Nothin'. I'm just gonna lay down. Let this bullet wound heal.
Think about some key investment opportunities for your future.
-Wait, like Biff from Back to the-- -Are you out of your tiny mind?
Get back in the house before our mother gets home, and don't make it weird.
-[sniffles] -Hey.
[frustratedly] Yes?
-This is amazing. -Isn't it, though?
Mind hitting the light on your way out?
-[door closes] -[sighs]
Oh, hey. I'm surprised you're still up.
Well, this night's been full of surprises, mother.
That's chilling. What happened?
How was your not-a-date? Will you be seeing him again?
-No. I don't know. I don't think so. -[knocking at door]
-Hi. -Hi.
-Me again. -Yes, it is.
You left your scarf in my car.
-I did. Gosh, thanks. -[Derek] Oh, hey there, kiddo.
Oh. This is my son, Adam. Adam, this is Derek.
Oh, hey, Adam.
Hello. You have a wonderful mouth mullet. You must be very proud.
Oh my gosh, Adam. [laughs]
-Never heard it called that before. -Well, thanks again.
Sure. See you soon.
Unlikely, but I'll put in a good word for you.
Okay. Okay. I'll see you at work.
-[Derek] Yeah. -Bye.
He seems nice.
What?
You can be a real jerk sometimes.
You know that? [sighs]
Hey there. Good morning.
Shouldn't you be at work?
Yeah, I need to pay the insurance on the house today.
Had it in the calendar, but I can't find the statement.
[Adam] With that filing system?
Shocking. It should all be online.
The minute I find myself with a few extra hours,
I will set up those accounts.
Until then, this is how your dad did it.
Hey, grab a pile.
Sorry. I gotta get to my room to think about what I've done.
Okay.
I gotta go.
Call me if you need me.
[Adam] I won't.

You're gonna go dressed like that?
Why don't you wear some of Dad's clothes?
How long ago was Dad's accident?
About a year and a half ago.
She still hasn't cleaned out his closet.
She's not much of a housekeeper.
Hey. You have her to take care of you. She has no one. You understand?
Do you understand?
She wakes up every morning
with a broken heart and a closet full of his clothes
and gets nothing from you but a fistful of crap,
and not even, like, ten seconds of genuine empathy.
I'm you, you know.
Tell me about it.
You know, 30 years, you still get sick to your stomach
every time you remember how you treated her now.
I used to love this jacket.
Dad did too.
I keep waiting to wake up and miss him less,
but that hasn't happened yet.
Do you still miss him?
Missed him while he was here.
-It's not gonna fit you. -Sure it will.
-[bleeping] -[young Adam] How's the jet?
It's gettin' there.
So the person you came to save is in 2018.
And somehow, you ended up in 2022. How does that work? You just missed?
Well, I got shot when I was stealing the plane.
So, uh… I was losin' blood. Ship was comin' apart.
I jammed the coordinates. I didn't have time to double-check 'em.
-Wait, you stole the jet? -It's encoded to me.
So I didn't exactly steal it. I borrowed the shit out of it.
-There's a difference. Give me some cash. -You don't have money?
-We don't use money in the future. -Really?
Of course we use money in the future. Stay here.
[Chuck laughs] What's up, Reed?
Crap.
Well, look who we have here.
Ray, can we just take a break from the ass kicking today?
I have a lot going on.
Hey, guys. Enjoying our suspension?
I am now.
[young Adam groans] That's my spleen.
I remember these little turd-burpers.
-Hey, man, we're, uh… just playin' around. -Quiet, Ray. This isn't about you.
Chuck.
Hey, what's goin' on? Huh?
Get it together. Ray's ready. You're embarrassing yourself.
So you're not gonna break this up?
God, no. That'd be irresponsible of me.
You'll just figure out some other way to pound the crap out of him.
You always do.
He's got a big mouth. I get it.
Point is, this fight needs to happen right now.
So just give us a second, okay, Ray?
Stretch out. You don't wanna pull a hammy.
What are you doing?
Hey, Ray Dollarhyde has been bullying you for years
because you're small, and fragile, and you have a big mouth.
But here's the thing. He doesn't wanna fight.
-I don't wanna fight either. -He doesn't know that, does he?
So you're gonna walk over there, and you're gonna raise your hands,
and then you're gonna look Ray right in the eye.
You're gonna smile in a way that says,
"I've waited my entire life for this moment."
Like you can't wait to watch his soul exit his body.
Then you're gonna drop to your knees
and punch him hard in the private bathing suit parts.
-I'm sorry, the what now? -Ah! Are we gonna smoke this banana?
Or are we gonna talk about it all day? Let's go, go, go, go, go.
I'm gonna smoke your banana, motherf--
No, no, no, no! No. That… that's not what we talked about.
-[groans] -[Ray] Boom!
[laughing] Oh yeah!
-[Chuck] Nice, man. -[Ray] You crying, Reed?
Oh no, Chuck. Look, we made him cry.
[Chuck] It's like he was trying to lose.
Run away, Reed!
-What the hell? -I'm not supposed to do this.
Ever hear the expression, "Every bully has a bully"?
Yours isn't holding up his end of the bargain, so I'm gonna take over.
-What are you talking about? -[shushes]
You're a good fighter. You like to kick ass. You're a big kid.
But if you go near Adam again, I'll know, and I will find you, Ray.
And it won't be like a couple of kids in a playground scrap.
I will pull bones out of your body.
I will sharpen them.
-I will use them to stab little Chuckie. -What did I do?
Shut your mouth, or I'll fill it with Ray's feet.
You understand what I'm saying? Got all of it? The bones?
-Yeah. -Your feet in Chuckie's mouth?
-[liquid running] -Good. Are you peeing right now?
-Yeah. -You're a real streamer.
Get yourself home and clean yourself up.
Be the change you wanna see, okay?
God, I hated those assholes.
Oh, come on.
Hey, Adam.
Get out of my stuff and open the door.
Put the drone down. It will kill us both.
Hey, look, you lost one fight. I figured you'd be used to that by now.
You coulda helped. You just stood there.
Christ. You're so sensitive.
Hey, you had to lose that fight.
You had to. Trust me.
You don't go from bein' you to bein' me without gettin' your ass kicked,
a lot, all the time.
I'm sorry if I went too far today.
Shouldn't have done that.
-[young Adam] Who's this? -Who's who?
Put that back.
You put that back.
As soon as you tell me who she is.
That's my wife, Laura.
We have a wife?
No, we do not have a wife anymore.
-[Ellie] Hey. -Hi.
-[man] Aah. Hi, there. How are you? -Hey, Paul.
[Paul] Been a while.
[Ellie] Yep, how you doin'? That baby sleeping yet?
Uh, not really. No.
[chuckles] No. Well, you'll miss those days when they're gone.
Ah, I find that hard to believe.
[Ellie] Believe it. Babies are pure love.
They grow into teenagers, who grow into be assassins of happiness.
Thank you, thank you.
Mm, well, somethin' to look forward to. [chuckles]
Sorry. It's been a rough day.
Year. Couple of years.
Hmm. Your boy still havin' a hard time?
He hates me.
[Paul] Hmm.
It's not his fault. He's… he's just dealing.
It's fine. We'll be fine. It's good. Good, good, good.
I wish I knew what I was doin' wrong.
You're not doin' anything wrong.
Sorry. [laughs]
-I'm sorry. -[laughing] Sorry, you scared me.
-I was eavesdropping. I'm sorry. -Yeah.
[chuckles] You're right, though. Teenage boys are horrible.
It's like living with a urinal cake that yells at you.
Mothers are usually the ones who take the hit.
Yeah.
-But I'll tell you somethin'. -Mmm?
Boys always come back for their mamas.
That's nice.
It sounds like you're speaking from experience.
I am.
You have a good mom?
-[Adam] I do. -Oh.
[whispers] I have the best mom.
Good.
I hope you're right.
I'm still researching boarding schools in Fallujah, so…
-Good. -[both laugh]
No, I don't mean that. He's such a sweet kid.
I'm crazy about him.
We lost his dad in a car accident year before last.
Yeah. That's tough.
Yeah. You have no idea.
Well, I have some idea.
-Oh, sorry. -Sorry.
Jinx.
-Thank you. -[Adam] Thank you.
Aren't you grieving too?
-Yeah. -[Adam] Yeah.
I am. Of course I am.
So tell him.
You should tell him.
I don't think he needs it.
You think you're being strong for him,
and the problem with acting like you have it all together is…
he believes it.
Maybe he needs to know that you don't.
It's okay if you don't.
My husband had a jacket just like that.
Oh, this is a classic.
Yeah.
It was really nice chatting with you. I'll see you later.
Oh, hey, um…
he doesn't hate you.
He loves you.
More than he knows.
Hey! Hey!
Locked and docked.
Start the area scans for his jet.
Let's find him and get the hell outta here.
Find him.
-So you came back for your wife, Laura? -We're not getting into that.
Hey, she's my wife too.
-You know what? We should get into that. -Thank you.
Met in the academy.
She was 20 minutes late to the wrong classroom
in the wrong building.
I offered to walk her to the right one, and…
man, I was all in before we even made it outside.
A couple of years ago, she didn't come back from a jump.
They told me her jet broke up on reentry, but she was the best pilot in the program.
She wrote the book on reentry. Didn't make sense.
And you were trying to get to 2018 'cause that's where she went before?
Yeah.
-What was she doing there? -I don't know.
They changed the jump logs.
Somebody was hidin' somethin'.
Maybe she saw something Sorian didn't want her to see.
Wait, "Sorian"? Maya Sorian, Dad's partner?
-She was always so nice to me. -Hmm.
Yeah, trust me. She's no friend.
Nope.
After Dad died, she got rich off of his tech.
Bought all the right people.
Next thing you know,
she has exclusive control over the most valuable resource on Earth,
time.
Wait a minute. You're saying Dad invented time travel?
Yeah.
Not on purpose.
The magnetic particle accelerator. Remember that?
He called it The Adam Project.
[Adam] Yeah, or as I like to call it, his favorite child.
So what happened to Laura?
Mmm. Well, I think your nice friend Maya had her killed.
-What? -Yeah.
That's why I gotta get back to 2018 as soon as possible.
The jet's almost ready. I'll lay low in the shed.
I'll heal for a few more days until I can get a clean read
and then fly out of your life.
But going back to save her.
-Talking to me. -[whines]
Everything you're doing right now just to rescue one person.
You're changing the future. That's gotta be against the rules.
You'll feel differently when you meet her.
-And when you lose her. -What?
[shushes] Grab that bag. Get ready to run.
Why? What's happening?
We're going that way. Be ready.
-[crackling] -[groaning]
-Move! -[whooshing]
Stay behind me. [exhales]
Don't you do it! Don't you do it, Reed!
Wanna see something cool?
-That's a lightsaber, dude. -Quiet now.
Time to go. Let's go.
[Sorian] Hello, Adam.
[man] Reed, don't move!
[Adam] Christos. They'll let anyone into this time stream.
Who's that?
That's Christos. We were in the academy together.
He's a decent pilot but a terrible person.
He runs security for Sorian.
Ouchie, with the face. Did I do that?
God, I hope the boss lets me kill you.
[chuckles] In fairness, though, you did shoot me first.
On the bright side, your… your face now matches your soul.
-Anyone say you talk too much? -All the time.
-It's come up. -[Sorian] That's enough.
Adam, before this goes any further, let's just go home, please.
Uh, no!
Just… just no.
So you're risking your own young life
over some paranoid delusion that I somehow killed Laura.
I loved Laura. You were both like family to me.
I would never have hurt her. I hate that it's come to this.
Guns.
Christos, please escort Adam back to 2050.
-You're up. -Yeah. All right, drop the Mag-Cyl.
-This? -Yeah.
-Yeah. Okay. -All right.
Wanna start low or go high?
-[young Adam] Stop! Get off him! -[Adam groans]

Come on, come on, come on!
Go. Go!
I knew you'd come someday. I just didn't know when.
[Adam] Of course I came.
[young Adam] Eyes on the road, please.
[Adam] They said you lit up on reentry.
That's crap. I have the top reentry stats in the program.
-Oh yeah. -[young Adam coughing]
Laura, this is… me.
-Hi. -Parallel contact, babe?
Well, you've always said that you wished you'd met me earlier.
-Here I am. -Yeah.
All right, can we maybe slow down a bit now?
There's no one even following us.
Don't look back. Look up.
[Adam] Gotta get off this road. We're too exposed.
Okay, baby, it's about to get busier.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
-[Laura yelps] -[young Adam yelps]
Stop the car.
-What? -What?
-Stop! -[Laura yells]
Okay, back, back. Go, go, go! Reverse!
Back! Back!
Go, go, go, go!
They're leaving.
They're not leaving. They're regrouping.
-We have to get off this road fast. -[young Adam] What road?
[Adam] I… I don't understand. How did you find us?
[Laura] You don't think I'd be watching your back, even in the past?
[Adam] Why did you make the jump back in the first place?
I was analyzing data when I found something strange in the jump logs.
A time jet returning from 2018.
How's that strange?
Because no one ever flew to 2018.
[Adam] I don't get it. How did it come back if it never left?
Unless someone went back and altered the time stream,
so the future the jet had left from had already been changed.
God, it's like I traded my brains for those muscles.
It's a shit deal.
-Cute kid. -Precious, isn't he?
Don't you just wanna hold him underwater till the bubbles stop?
-[chuckles] -Oh, I freakin' hate myself.
How did this happen?
[Laura] That jet that went back? It was Sorian's.
She went back to November 2018 for a reason.
What happened in November 2018?
I'll tell ya. [sighs]
This happened.
Your father's magnetic particle accelerator,
The Adam Project, had just gone online.
That was the first step toward practical time travel.
Sorian must've come back to 2018
and given her younger self some kind of future intel.
What for?
My guess is enough future stock tips to amass her fortune
and get rid of whatever political obstacles
were keeping her from gaining control of the time program.
She already had that.
But did she?
No.
No, she didn't.
No.
So this world, our world,
everything has already been changed by Sorian.
And your fixed time, 2050, is it bad there?
-We've seen Terminator, right? -Obviously.
That's 2050 on a good day.
Sorian must've spotted me and planted an altitude bomb on my jet.
Here, eat something.
-I managed to eject, but it didn't matter. -[mouths]
Without my jet, I was a permanent castaway.
So I had to follow protocol, you know, live out my life here,
avoid contact, minimize my footprint,
and hope you were crazy enough to come look for me.
Alone. All this time.
Four years.
That's the job, right?
-Yeah, but, baby-- -It's…
It's fine. I got used to being alone.
Not anymore.
-[sighs] -[Adam] Hey.
I found you.
-[Laura chuckles] -I found you.
You found me.
-I'll take my eyes and ears for a walk. -[Adam] Bye now.
[young Adam] You kids have fun.
-[sighs] Hey. -Hi.
[moans] Ah, da-da-da-da--
-What's wrong? -I got shot.
-You got shot? -By a gun, yeah.
-Reed? -Yeah?
-Suck it up. -Yes, ma'am.
[whispers] Yes, boss.
-You know what you have to do. -Nooooo.
No, I came back for you.
I know.
But we can't have a life here. Not like this.
Now you have to go back to 2018, and you have to put things right.
-You have to put an end to all this. -What do you mean "put an end to it"?
I mean, stop time travel
from ever being invented and save the future.
Fine, come with me, and we'll--
Your jet is meshed for your DNA. It won't fly with anyone else.
-You're smart. You can figure it out. -Adam!
We meet in the program. We meet there. Do you understand that? We can't…
If I go back and stop time travel,
and that's an extremely big "if" with Sorian on my ass,
we never meet.
We never happen.
We never happen, Laura.
We did happen.
Every moment we ever had will always have happened.
Even if we correct the time stream,
somewhere in us will be the echo of this one.
And we will find each other.
I really believe that.
What if we don't? What if… what if you're wrong?
And you're probably wrong.
When am I ever wrong?
-Hey, hey. -[sobs]
I can't do this again, okay?
I can't do this again, please. I can't afford to lose you. Don't do this.
What is that?
They found us.
[gasping] Damn it!
There's a dirt road around the bend.
-I'll buy you time to get to your jet. -No, no, no. Hey. I'm not leaving.
-You have to. -What are you talking about?
-Those guys'll kill you. -No! I've had years--
I've had years to rig my defenses. They'll never see me coming.
-If they catch you, it's over. -That's the only reason--
Adam! Stop it! Please. [sobs]
I know you came for me.
[sobbing] Now you have to leave for me, please.
Please.
[whispers] We can fix this.
Hey, I love you.
That's why I know you're gonna find me again.
Go.
Go!
God damn it!
Come on.
Come on.
Boom.
[Adam] Jet's not reading me because of my vitals.
I'll need your DNA to start her up.
When we get to altitude, the bio stop will come down, and then I can take over.
We have to move fast, or they'll be on us before we can jump to 2018.
-Wait. What? I'm not coming with you. -Yes, you are. Let's go. We need to go.
[Laura] Christos!
-[panting] -It's good to see you, buddy.
Laura, is that you?
You're not still mad at me for blowing up your jet, are you?
If I'm being honest, yeah, I'm still kinda pissed.
Will you stop and listen to me?
This is my fixed time. You already had my childhood.
You had adventures, you flew planes,
and I'm still the nerd with an inhaler who gets his ass kicked.
I want the rest of it.
-Want the rest? -Yeah.
Here's the rest of it. Dad's death screws you up more than you ever realize.
You get depressed. You get angry.
You wander around school without making a social dent.
College is a high point, until after a year, you lose your scholarship
for something that is so unbelievably stupid
I cannot even say it out loud right now.
You end up in the air force. Turns out you could really fly.
And then along comes time travel, and the whole world starts to fall apart
until the only woman you have…
the only woman you ever loved gets taken away.
Do you understand me?
Till you lose…
She… she just gets taken away.
-There's gotta be more than that. -[Adam] There is, kid.
And thanks to Sorian, none of it's good.
We can fix it.
-By destroying time travel? -That's right.
How are we gonna do that? What's your plan?
I'm not gonna explain my plan to a nerd with an inhaler--
-You don't have a plan. -Because I do not have a plan.
-Exactly. -That is correct.
But I know somebody who might.
Dad.
Dad.
You're gonna find Dad.
[Adam] Nope.
We're gonna find Dad.
So are you in or are you--
Tell your husband to get his bitch ass out here.
He's busy right now,
but I'll tell him you stopped by.
Hello, Laura.
You should have stayed dead the first time.
Now, where is your husband?
[Adam panting] Okay.
Here we go. All right, give me your hand.
-[whirring] -Like that, yep.
Nice, healthy DNA right there.
Okay, we'll park it down there,
grab on to that railing,
hold on for dear life, and try not to pass out from the G's, okay?
What's a… Jesus!
-What's happening? -That.
[young Adam yelps] What are you doing?
Gotcha!
Hang on.
I told you to hang on.
Don't give me that stink eye.
Where you going?
Shit!
[Adam] Okay, hold tight. I've always wanted to try this.
[young Adam] Did you just turn the plane off?
[Adam] Yes, I did.
[young Adam] Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God!
Where the hell are they?
-[Christos] They gotta be here somewhere. -[Sorian] Adam, check your ion readings.
The reactor's damaged.
You have one jump left.
If you don't come back now, you never will.
What do you say, kid? Your call.
We don't pull this off, we're not gettin' back, either one of us.
-Punch that shit. -Oh yeah!
Gotcha.
♪ Hey ♪
-♪ Well, my temperature's rising… ♪ -Come on!
♪ And my feet on the floor ♪
-♪ Crazy people knockin'… ♪ -Adam!
I got this.
♪ Let me in, baby I don't know what you got ♪
♪ But you better take it easy… ♪
Come on, Reed. Come on.
-[young Adam] Adam! -[Adam] I got it!
-Adam! -I got it!
-[young Adam] Adam! -♪ So glad we made it… ♪
Come on!
-Let's not… -[alarm bleeping]
Die!
♪ Every day ♪
[man] It's not meant to be easy.
Listen, guys, instead of moaning about it,
give yourself permission to be inadequate, and then get to work.
You can't be good at something unless you're willing to be…
-[blows raspberry] …at it first. -[laughter]
-Professor Reed. -Sophie.
It'll take two semesters just to begin solving that.
[Louis] Oh, good God, at least that.
[Sophie] Even then, we'll fail the class, because this is bonkers.
[Louis] Sophie, you can do this.
Listen, guys, that is the beauty of physics.
[voice fading] That is the beauty of life…
It's really him.
[Louis] Now, guys.
-Yep. -[Louis] If you think you've got…
He's so…
[Adam] Yeah.
Alive. Come here for a second. Hey.
-Let me do the talking in there. -We have to tell him what happens.
-He doesn't have to die. -We say nothing, okay?
Only what he needs to know. Everything else…
we can't.
I wanna hear you say it, "I won't tell him." Say it.
-Say it. -I won't tell him.
Physics is a slog. It's a slog.
We are meant to work on problems that our children will solve.
You might find the odd solution here or there.
I just got your shirt, by the way. It's very clever.
But you will die before your life's work is done.
Your cold, lifeless husk will be moldering in the ground
while generations that come after you
will be finishing the work that you started.
To quote the Romans,
"Enjoy yourselves.
It's later than you think."
[Adam] Guy Lombardo.
-I am s… I'm sorry? -[Adam] Guy Lombardo. That was… Yeah.
The quote, um… "It's later than you think." It's not the Romans.
It's a singer. Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians.
It was Guy Lombardo,
and it was from his 1949 classic, "Enjoy Yourself."
But long before that,
it was the Romans who etched it on their sundials.
So, uh… so we're both right.
It's interesting that you, uh… you know that.
I'm sorry, do I know you?
Just auditing the class. [chuckles]
Any other questions?
All right, the, uh, reading's on my website, and I'll see you Tuesday.
Adam?
Dad.
Dad.
[Louis] Adam?
Is… is this time travel?
-[Louis] He came from 2050 and got you? -[young Adam] Yes.
-How old are you now? -[young Adam] Twelve.
-Why did you need your 12-year-old self? -[Adam] I didn't.
-You needed me to fly the jet. -Jet? There… there's a jet?
-My jet. -Oh.
What I meant was I didn't need you originally.
-2022 was a mistake. -Wh--
And you flew this jet?
-Yes. -Did you, though?
-Is that my jacket? Looks tight on you. -That's what I said.
-It's fine. -Like a condom with buttons.
-This is fun. I'm having fun, are you? -Condom!
And why was 2022 a mistake?
-I wasn't supposed to be there. -You're not supposed to be here.
-You don't say. -They shot him when he stole the jet.
-Please don't tell him that. -You stole a jet?
-Why would he need to know that? -Okay, stop. Both of you stop talking now.
Do you realize how absolutely wrong this is?
You can't be here. You can't be anywhere but your own timeline.
What do you think we're doin' here? Think we're short of hugs in the future?
-There's a reason I need to talk to you. -I don't-- I don't care.
-He doesn't care. -Don't get me wrong.
I'm very happy to see you, and I mean this in the best possible way,
but you need to piss off to where you came from.
Anything you say or do could cause a divergence.
Can you please shut up for a second?
-I'm not gonna listen-- -For a second and listen.
-Shut the physics fountain in your face. -What you are doing is reckless.
-Dad! -[groans]
[young Adam] You okay?
-God damn it! -[groaning]
-[Adam] In fairness, I-- -It's okay.
I asked him nicely to shut up and listen.
-He did no such thing, so… -It's okay. It's fine. I'm fine.
So-- Oh, you…
That's what you get. We don't hit people in this family.
What was that?
-That's what you get. -God!
How did you turn out to be an asshole? I thought you loved me.
-I do! -None of it matters anymore.
-Are you kidding me? Of course it matters. -Dad.
They don't have safeguards where you come from?
-Dad. -Protocols?
-Maya and I agreed. -Dad.
-There'd be an ethics panel-- -Dad!
With real oversight.
None of it matters anymore.
Wait. It already happened? Somebody already altered time?
-Who? -Sorian.
-Maya? -Maya.
She'd never do that. She knows the consequences.
-She's been funding my work for years. -The Adam Project.
Yes, I theorized that with a powerful enough pulse,
we could generate utilitarian wormholes in space.
And we did it four weeks ago.
But I was… I was just playing with the theory
that you can use wormholes for time travel.
That part's theoretical.
-Right. -Still theoretical.
This theory needs to take a leak. So let's go.
Holy shit! I'm the godfather of time travel?
Nice hit, Dad.
[whispers] I think I broke my hand.
[Louis] I'm… I'm sorry. This is my fault.
My… my ego. My hubris.
My need to be best, to be first, to be the smartest guy in the room.
And here we are.
-A disgusting character flaw. -He didn't know.
-[Louis] But I should have. -Yeah.
Mankind has no business tampering with the mechanics of the universe.
There are forces greater than science.
Right. That's why we're gonna put the genie back in the bottle.
Destroy time travel before it's even invented.
Uh--
What's done, no matter how terrible,
should not and cannot be undone under any circumstance.
Even us being here, talking like this, we're perverting fate and time.
I told you Sorian already did that. She's had the world by the balls since.
And you know that for a fact?
Do you have scientific proof that she changed things?
No, you don't because you can't know. But I will tell you this.
You being here opens up the potential for catastrophic reconfiguration.
-And that is quantifiable, that-- -Stop. Stop.
-Stop. -Stop what?
-Stop being a scientist. -But I am a scient--
Be a father.
You were always more interested in the universe than your son.
-That's not true. -[Adam] That is true.
And when you're older, you'll realize that. It--
You know what? It's…
That ship has sailed. It's too late for me. So, you know, whatever. I'm fine.
But he needs you.
[Louis] Hmm.
And you? What do you need?
I need to go for a walk.
I can't be here, Adam. I… I have to go.
-Please don't go. -I have to.
-Please. -This is… this is bigger than any of us.
It's too dangerous what he's asking me to do. I can't.
All right. We'll see each other again.
Wait.
-I need to tell you something. -No, you can't say anything else to me.
I can't know the future.
I'm sorry.
I have to go home. Your mom and you are waiting.
[woman] Yes, Senator.
Except the stability of these wormholes is no longer a hypothetical,
and the work we are doing here is simply ahead of the current statutes.
So you can either support my program and be a part of the future,
or you can get left behind in the past.
[Sorian] Hang up the phone.
What are you doing here? You said I wouldn't be seeing you again.
Did I? Hmm.
When was that? Remind me.
[Maya] The last time you just showed up, two months ago.
Oh, well, for me, it was 32 years ago.
So sorry if I'm a little fuzzy on the details.
Anyway, times have changed.
You can't be here.
You know the potential for catastrophic changes to the time stream.
-It's incalculable. -God, I was such a nerd.
Will you please just stop talking?
Everything you asked me to do.
The stock buys, the offshore accounts, all of it. It's unethical.
-And illegal. -This isn't a joke. It's dangerous.
The environmental impact alone from the companies you had me pick
could be devastating.
In fairness to us,
the environment was pretty much toast before we came along.
And by the way, Maya, you did it, all of it,
because somewhere inside that cheap suit and ridiculous ponytail is me.
I'm leaving.
Where you going?
You seeing someone?
No, you're not. You're too busy.
[clicks tongue] Thing is, you always will be.
This company is all you will ever have.
-[sighs] -It is your personal life.
It's your family.
But this is our legacy.
And if we had let the government take it from us,
then everything we sacrificed,
all that loneliness,
all that loneliness,
would've been for nothing.
And I did it.
I fixed that future where we had been forgotten.
Then why are you back here now?
I'm back
because we can't control time travel if it never existed.
And your buddy Adam Reed is about to betray you.
Adam? He's just a little kid.
Yeah, well, that little kid…
[laughs] …he grows up to be a very big pain in our ass.
[sighs] Trust me. You're gonna want this.
What?
I know you think you know more than me because you're older.
Go away, Adam. [sighs]
And I know why you hate him so much.
Really?
[laughs] Well, do tell. I'm on the edge of my seat here.
Holy shit. I wonder what it i-- Was it because he's narcissistic,
or, uh, never came home from work
or cared more about his job than his son--
It's because he died.
You hate him
because he died.
You made yourself hate him
because it was easier than missing him.
And I remember some stuff that you maybe don't wanna.
Oh yeah?
Like what?
He played catch with us
almost every night.
Catch.
He'd get home from work,
be so tired, and I'd be in the yard throwing the ball against the pitch back.
-You remember the pitch back, right? -Oh, I… I remember the pitch back.
Yeah, he bought it so he didn't have to play with me.
Nope.
He bought it because they had one in the window of Altman's.
And every time we passed that store,
I begged him to buy it for me,
so that's what Dad did.
He'd see me throwin' in the yard, and no matter how tired he was,
he'd always grab his mitt to come out for a catch.
Things happened to you, to us.
And we suck at dealing with it.
I'm starting to think it's something we do.
I give Mom a hard time now, and…
I think…
I think it's easier to be angry than it is to be sad.
And I guess, when I get older,
I forget that there's a difference.
How'd you get to be so smart?
How'd you get to be so dumb?
Nice try, asshole.
[Ellie] Adam, make sure you feed Hawking before you leave for school, honey.
-Oh. -[sizzling]
-You're still here. -[Louis] Oh.
And you're cooking. What are you making? Hi.
Uh, I know you like the Denver omelet.
That's not a Denver omelet. That is a cry for help.
The eggs are burnt, and the bacon's still somehow totally raw.
Oh, you… Oh, no, no. No, no, no. Wha--
Do you wanna talk about why you're still here
instead of being at work?
I… I… Well, I just wanted to stay home with you today.
You don't say. I like this guy.
This guy likes you.
What's going on with you, honey?
Does he seem, uh… does he seem sad to you?
No.
He's an odd duck, like his dad.
I happen to collect odd ducks.
I don't know if I should've built that game for him.
Shouldn't he be outside, playing with the rest of the kids?
How is he gonna find his place in the world?
"His place in the world"? He's a kid. We're his place in the world.
You're his place in the world.
[sighs] Okay, whatever is going on, listen, I can tell you the truth
or something that's gonna make you feel better.
I'd rather cut to it and tell you the truth, if you're up for it.
I… I'd rather something that'll make me feel better.
[laughs] Yeah, I know.
Kidding. Sort of.
Okay, tell me.
When you are with us… [clicks tongue]
…you're with us 100%.
It's amazing.
And when you're not…
[laughs] …it's like… pfft.
So is he a little lonely?
Yeah, probably.
But does that make you a shitty guy? No.
I've gotta do better.
Hey, buddy, I have good news for you.
He doesn't need perfect. He just needs you.
Your cooking makes you a borderline serial killer,
but the rest of you is pretty awesome.
Ellie.
You know I love you.
Yeah, I know.
I'm extremely lovable.
Yeah.
[Ellie] Hmm.
I have to go to work.
Okay, okay, okay.
-And, hey, you got time. -[sighs]
"It's later than you think."
[young Adam] Really think we can?
Maybe, maybe not. We'll see.
But we're gonna try anyway.
Destroy time travel. How will we do that?
This is the world's largest electromagnetic accelerator.
It's 2018, so EM technology isn't stable yet.
So here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna blow this bitch up.
-Blow it up? -Yep.
How did I live this long? That's a terrible idea.
Yeah, well, when a bad idea is the only idea, it becomes a great idea.
Who said that?
You. Nine years from now, right before you get arrested.
-What? -Try to focus.
We'll have to deal with security. You know this bag of toys you love?
Yeah.
Being a geek is about to pay off.
-Reading me? -[young Adam] Roger that, Red Leader.
This is Butternut Sippy Cup. Ten-four, over.
Let's just talk like normal people, okay?
[young Adam] Copy that…
Red Leader.
Somethin's wrong.
There's nobody here.
Which means they're here.
Sorian warned her younger self we were coming.
Are you sure?
Oh, pretty sure.
-Don't move. On your knees. -I'm sorry. What?
We're taking you back to 2050, Reed.
I can't hear you through the helmet. It muffles a bit. It's hard to hear you.
Don't get me wrong, your outfits are incredible though.
They're intimidating but also scream, "Please don't hurt me."
[soldier] On your knees. I won't tell you again.
Well, you… you're right about that.
Adam, what are you doing? I'm about to get my ass kicked.
Don't worry. He doesn't wanna fight.
They wanna fight. They really, really wanna fight.
Just look him in the eyes and smile.
Smile in a way that says, "I want this."
"I've been waiting my whole life for this."
Then hit him in the private bathing suit parts.
-Adam! -Roger that.
Pyeow!
Yeah!
Adam, you're on those cars, right?
Roger that, middle-aged Adam.
Bye. Pfft.
Adam!
-[gasps, grunts] -[Louis] Whoo!
That was invigorating!
-Dad? -Dad?
-I'm sorry. Are you okay? -This close!
-That was amazing. -This close!
-Where's little Adam? -He's fine!
-Hey, hey! -Hey?
That's your mother's car.
The car?
What are you doin' here?
I went to the motel, and when I didn't find you there,
I… I figured I'd find you here.
It's not like you're keeping a low profile, obviously.
What the hell is this?
Tell you what? You come up with a plan, and we'll do it your way. Sound good?
Oh God. Thank God. There's a plan.
I was beginning to think you were making this up as you went along.
Adam, I'm goin' inside. Cover the perimeter.
-No one gets in behind me. -Sorry. That was harsh.
Roger Dodger.
[Adam] Harsh? You shaved my ass with a Subaru.
I… I saved your ass with a Subaru, son.
What's Dad doing?
-Dad's being critical. Big surprise. -Okay, I--
You're trying to break into a highly sensitive, secure facility
with a sixth-grader.
I am not being critical. I'm… I'm narrating.
Will you just stop? Stop. Where the hell are you going?
To destroy your accelerator, and I'm gonna enjoy it.
Do you realize that you have broken every rule?
You've blown past every conceivable ethical boundary like it wasn't there.
Yeah? Then why are you here, Dad?
Because you can't do it without me.
Some people dream of the future.
Here at Sorian Technologies, we're building it.
[Louis] If you destroy the accelerator, Sorian will simply rebuild it.
-[Adam] So what will work? -[Louis] What you're after is ISPCA.
Infinitely Shifting Plasma Containing Algorithm,
which I designed to stabilize the wormholes.
That is the mathematical equation that will make time travel possible.
How do you destroy math?
I've never written the algorithm down or demonstrated it to another human being,
so it lives here in the old bean,
and in the subbasement in a diamond-hard neuromorphic processor.
Are you talking about your penis?
Can… can we be serious now?
Yes. No. Yes.
-It's a hard drive, okay? -[chuckles]
-God, you're such a child. -Sorry.
There is a crystal hard drive running the algorithm in a closed loop.
That is the nerve center of the accelerator.
So we go there, destroy the hard drive, prevent time travel from being invented.
Theoretically, time travel--
Oh my God! You're killing me with the theoretical.
-Yes, that should do it. -Good. Let's do that.
-Okay. Okay. -Okay. Okay.
-Okay. -[whirring]
-This is where you work. -Yes.
Only took you 44 years to bring me here.
Fair.
I am so keeping this thing.
-[Adam] So this is it? -[Louis] This is it.
I gotta hand it to you, Dad. You were not messin' around.
This is where we house the hard drive.
-[Adam] What happens if you pull it out? -[Louis] One of two things.
The accelerator will continue to run on a dormant loop.
But without the algorithm, no one will ever be able to program it again.
Or?
Or there's a cataclysmic meltdown
that will destroy all living things within 100 miles.
Well, let's hope it's the first thing.
[computer] Neuromorphic hard drive panel accessed.
Screw it.
Oh!
-Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho! -Whew! [laughing]
[Maya] Louis.
[Louis] Maya?
Long time no see.
Oh, this shit's about to get weird.
Were you really gonna steal that from us? Destroy everything we've worked for?
[Louis] Our work was supposed to have moral ground rules.
-We were gonna change the world. -Change the world?
The only thing that's changed is you. Have you lost your mind?
All these years, I funded your work.
I'm not the villain here. I spent millions--
Hundreds of millions of my money, my wealth.
-Mmm. -Just to fund your every indulgence.
But this…
this is mine to do with as I please.
Now,
Adam,
give me… the drive.
No.
Just… no.
I thought you were gonna say that.
Come here.
Gimme the gun.
Maya, Jesus Christ.
What are you doing? Are you crazy?
Oh, I think that's well established.
Adam, just listen to her.
It's okay. It's all right.
'Cause Adam's gonna give me the drive right now.
Shhh.
Aren't you, Adam?
-Adam? -Adam?
[Sorian] Hey, beautiful idiot. If I shoot him, you die too.
[Louis] Adam?
I'm thinking it over.
-What? What do you mean you're thinking? -Yeah.
-It's a complicated issue. -What is there to think over?
-It's a big decision! -No, it's not!
-It's not. -I need to think it through!
I'm about to lose my shit here!
-Give her the drive! -Give her the drive, man!
-Give her the drive! -[Maya] Please!
[computer] Electromagnetic seal compromised.
[groans] Run!
[computer] Commencing emergency protocols.
[soldier] Come here.
-Dad! -Adam!
[young Adam] Ow!
[grunts] Hey! Let me go!
[Louis] Adam, just hang on!
-[young Adam] Let me go! -Get me that drive! Now!
[computer] Access denied.
[young Adam] Get off me! Dad!
This way!
♪ Well, I'm takin' my time ♪
♪ Just movin' along ♪

-Get the drive! -The drive!
[whispers] Superhero landing.
Ever had your ass kicked by a 12-year-old nerd with an inhaler?
-Suppertime, Spanky. -No.
-[yelps] -No!
-[Christos growls] -[gasps]
Finish him!
Ahh!
-[Christos] Come on! -[choking]
-[Sorian] Christos! -No!
[computer] Core breached.
Reactor stability compromised.
Commence evacuation.
Lockdown in two minutes.
Buddy, it's time to go. Come on.
I can't shut it down!
[Maya] Stop!
I want my drive.
You can't have it.
Shoot him now.
Get behind me, both of you.
Look, Dad, Dad, those guns shoot armor-piercing bullets.
So even behind you, we're still Swiss cheese.
-Thanks for that information. -You're welcome.
-Maybe spread out a little. -Maybe a good idea.
[Louis] Maya, you're not a murderer.
Not yet, anyway.
[Sorian] Listen to me.
Everything we've worked for,
it goes away unless you pull this trigger.
Okay, come on.
[computer] One minute 30 seconds until lockdown.
[Sorian] You can do it.
Do it!
Maya, you're better than this.
Sorry, Louis, but you brought this on yourself.
Maybe so.
You think I'm playing?
Ask your son how I play.
I had to kill his wife twice to protect the integrity of my program.
Now, don't think I won't put a bullet right through you.
Give it to me!
No.
[computer] One minute until lockdown.
You just never understood the bigger picture. [chuckles sadly]
And you never understood the science.
How did you know that would work?
Those armor-piercing rounds contain a magnetic steel core.
Sometimes it pays to be a nerd, guys.
[computer] Containment protocol initiated.
-Ten seconds remaining. -Whoa.
-Yeah, we should run. -Yep.
[computer] Nine.
Eight.
Seven.
[computer] Six.
-Five. -[Louis] Go!
Four.
Three.
-[Louis yelling] Oh, shit! -[computer] Two.
One.
Well, I'd say Bring Your Kid to Work Day was a huge success.
-Uh-huh. -Yep.
-[Adam] What are you looking at? -[Louis] You're still here.
I figured after we eliminated time travel, you two would go back to your fixed times.
It probably takes a while for 30 years of changed time
to sort itself out.
[young Adam] I don't think we have long.
I can feel somethin' happening.
[Adam] Me too.
Sure it's okay for us to be here?
[Louis] It's fine. Your mom takes you to science club on Thursdays.
Look, um… Dad.
[sighs] There's somethin' we need to tell you.
I… I already know.
I knew the moment I saw you.
I'm sorry, boys. I'm, uh…
I'm sorry that I'm… I'm not gonna be there for you down the road,
and I've given it a lot of thought,
but you cannot tell me how or when it happens.
You came back here
because no one has a right to change the future, including us.
It's your future.
No.
You're my future.
Both of you.
And how lucky am I
that I got to see it?
I haven't been there for you.
And I'm sorry.
But I saw you being born.
I watched you take your first breath.
And after that happens, nothing is ever the same again.
You're my son, Adam,
and I love you.
-You're my boy, and I love you. -Okay. You don't have to do all--
I loved you from the first minute that I saw you.
-And that will never change. -I… I get that.
-Adam, you're my boy. -Dad? We really don't have to do all--
-You're amazing. -[Adam] Okay.
-I love you. -I get it, Dad.
I don't think you do.
-I am proud of you. -Okay.
[Louis] I love you, son.
Know that inside your heart. Know… Come here.
Come here.
[Louis] You're my boys, and you'll always be my boys.
Throughout all time.
-[Adam sniffles] I love you, Dad. -[Louis] I love you, buddy.
[whispers] Don't carry this around anymore.
I need you, Dad.
It's so hard without you.
I know.
You're gonna be okay.
-You're gonna be better than okay. -You don't know that.
Are you kidding me?
Have you seen this guy?
There's gotta be somethin' we can do.
I can think of somethin'.
[Adam] You really gonna do this?
Oy.
All right.
All right. Can you do me a favor?
I don't know if we're gonna remember any of this,
but maybe there'll be an echo or somethin', like Laura said.
But just in case,
give Mom a hug for me.
Would you do that?
Not one of your lame-ass side hugs either.
I'm talkin' the break-a-rib kinda hug. Yeah?
Yeah.
Holy shit.
What?
I spent 30 years trying to get away from the me that was you.
And I'll tell you what, kid.
I hate to say it, but you were the best part all along.
-Are we gonna smoke this banana or sit-- -Play ball!
Hey there.
Aren't you late for work?
Yeah. I need to pay the insurance on the house.
It's in the calendar, but I can't find the statement.
With that filing system? Shocking.
-Shocking. -[Adam] It should all be online.
[Ellie] This is how Dad did it.
-Grab a pile, would you? -I'll be late for school.
Oh my gosh. You're right. Okay. Have a great day, honey.
Adam.
[Adam] Yeah?
Just making sure I wasn't getting mugged.
Maybe you are.
Get over here! Get over here!
Aaargh!
I love you, honey.
Love you too.
[man] So, as I said earlier,
our goal is to calculate the variability of gravitational force,
which depends entirely on whether your path of motion
is toward the Earth or away from it.
So let's define the gravitational force of the Earth on an object
by Newton's gravitational formula.
F is equal to big G, Newton's gravitational constant,
multiplied by m sin 1 times m sin 2
divided by r squared.
And m sin 1 is the mass of the Earth, m sin e,
m sin 2 is the mass of the object the Earth is exerting force on.
-And r-- -Can you believe this guy?
He's been talking for 15 minutes. Managed to put the entire class to sleep.
[lecturer] …force is directly…
You look awake.
No. No, no, no, no, no.
I've trained myself to…
to fall fast asleep but keep my eyes open.
Check it out.
-[snoring] -[laughs]
…gotta believe in the miracle…
-Are you serious? -[snoring]
-Cool, right? -Yeah.
-Yeah. -Super cool. [chuckles]
I'm Adam. Adam… Adam Reed.
Laura Shane.
-Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you too.
-I'll, um… I'll be quiet. -Okay.
-Where do they find these guest lecturers? -[snickering]
Right?
It's like they're genetically engineered to bore us to death.
You're totally a guest lecturer, aren't you?
-Yes, I am. Yeah. -Shit.
What's your field?
Um… computational linguistics.
-No way! -Yeah.
-I don't know what that is. Um… -Oh.
-What does that have to do with flying? -Uh… not a damn thing.
-Oh. -Yeah.
Oh. You're in the wrong place, I think.
-That's subjective. This is Schaefer 309? -Literally in the wrong place. Farrel 309.
-No. -Yep.
-No. -Yeah.
[Laura] I don't think that…
-[Adam] Yeah. Oof. -Okay. Oh.
-I knew it. -Okay. All right.
-Bingo. Yeah. -Okay. Okay.
Then I'm in the wrong building.
Actually, you're in the wrong campus.
Then I'm lost.
Not anymore. I found you.
I can… I can walk you to Schaefer.
Are you sure? I mean, I would hate to disturb your sleep.
I've, uh…
I've got time.
Plus…
-[snoring] -[laughs]
Okay.
-Okay. -Yeah.

We need to patch you in.
Hang on.
Come on.
[Jakub] Peter.
[Peter over speakers] Patching you in now.
On behalf of the Euro Space Program and the Czech people,
189 days into your solo journey,
welcome back, Commander Procházka.
Commissioner Tuma. Hello from the outskirts of Jupiter.
I'm very excited to be talking to you from here.
It's so great to see you again. You look well.
It seems like the long wait is coming to an end.
[chuckles softly] Yes, that is correct.
The reason for this journey is right in front of me.
I'm sure the images I've sent back doesn't do it justice.
But the Chopra Cloud is more astonishing than what you could ever imagine.
I wish you could all see it the way I do.
[Tuma] This phenomenon has haunted our skies for the past four years,
and now your images have captivated the world.
Truly spectacular.
Well, in less than a week,
I will collect and analyze the particles that make up the cloud.
We still don't know what they are or where they come from.
But as I enter the Chopra Cloud,
I might just unravel some mysteries of the universe.
Commander, would you mind taking a few questions from the people of the world?
I'll do my best.
[girl] Hello, my name is Anna.
I'm in sixth grade.
And I read that you're the loneliest man in the world.
I think what Anna here is saying is that the commander
is the farthest away from anyone in history.
Is that what you mean?
Does it make you sad to be so far away?
Well, I am some 500 million kilometers away.
And yes, this is a solo mission, but I know I'll be coming back soon.
I'm nearing the halfway mark for my scheduled return to Earth,
and I have so much work to do.
And I get to talk to people from all over the world
like you and Mission Control.
And your wife, Lenka, of course.
She and I can talk over the CzechConnect Quantum
faster than the Speed of Light Phone,
which keeps us connected.
We talk every day.
What I'm doing is for everyone back home, and that makes me very proud.
No, I'm not the loneliest man in the world.
Thank you, Anna.
And thank you, Commander.
We're going to take a short break here,
and we'll be back after a word from our generous sponsors.
[narrator] Non-drowsy Antiquease,
the official nausea medication of the Jakub Procházka Mission to Chopra.
[Lenka] You'll be all right, Jakub.
You're not afraid to be on your own.
I was afraid,
but I'm not anymore.
[sobbing] I love you.
But people change.
And if you don't let them change, they die.
[cries] I have to leave you.
I'm so sorry it has to be now, but--
[man] Yes?
Lenka problem.
Peter, would you be so kind to approve another repair to the toilet?
[sighs] Let me see if I can get engineering to clear that.
Did you replace the O-rings like we suggested?
Yes, I did.
And it's still screaming.
Maybe you and I can troubleshoot it later.
But the orders are that the broken cameras take priority over the toilet, so…
When did you take your sleep drops last night?
8:30. Why?
You don't look so good. Did you sleep?
I tried.
But just maybe I look like shit
because the toilet keeps fucking up my nights.
[Peter] Okay, I hear you.
But try to find time for a nap. You need rest.
[Jakub] Have you guys heard from Lenka?
No. Why?
[Lenka over laptop] I know you can feel the silence.
[sighs] Oh my, oh my.
[Lenka] We're both on the CzechConnect and…
there's just silence.
So what's the point?
He is under tremendous pressure. He isn't sleeping.
He's not getting this message.
-We're holding it back? -[Tuma] Hm.
[sighs] He's already concerned he hasn't heard from her.
He's not getting this message.
I'll go talk to her.
I'll think of something to tell him.
[automated voice] Lenka is not answering. If you'd like to leave a message--
CzechConnect keeps you connected.
Oh…
What?
[Peter] You are clear for the Chopra Sample Collection Simulation.
Confirming scenario beta 3-3.
[Jakub] Sample collection simulation confirmed.
Peter, are you reading?
[Peter] Still no Camera D?
Yes. Electrical fine. Camera dead. Same story.
[Peter] That's half the ship's cameras malfunctioning.
I don't understand what's happening.
I'll file another report. [sighs]
I'm sure that'll be very effective.
[Jakub] Can someone go to my home?
[Peter] Why?
[Jakub] Still haven't heard from her.
[Peter] Okay, we'll find her. Don't worry.
[automated voice] Lenka is not answering. If you'd like to leave a message--
Lenka?
Hello?
[man over CzechConnect] Hello.
Who is this?
Who do I have here?
[man] Can I help you?
Who the hell is this?
Hello?
[man] My apologies.
Peter, are you on?
[Peter] Yes.
I'm getting interference.
[Peter] That's very strange.
Could someone have hacked the CzechConnect?
[Peter] Mmm, not likely. Our system is secure.
If there's interference, it's over the radio, but…
Was it Korean?
[Jakub] Why would it be Korean?
[Peter sighs] There are indications the South Koreans are closing in.
It's not Korean.
Someone probably just left the channel open here.
And what do you suggest?
[Peter sighs] I'll look into it.
You doing okay? Is everything all right?
Yes, Peter, everything is very good.
[Peter] So listen, we've just learned that Lenka's on her way to visit her mother.
She'll be back in a couple of days.
[Jakub] Yeah? Get her to call me.
What the fuck?
Control, do you have a secret camera in the head?
-[Peter] Why? -You do?
[Peter] Yeah. Well, it's a safety issue.
Pull it up right now.
[Peter] But it's out. It was one of the first ones to go out.
You gotta be kidding me.
[Peter] Jakub, what's going on? Hello?
Jakub, why aren't you responding?
[spider] I was lulled by the meditative sounds of your tube.
I did not intend to frighten you, skinny human.
-[Peter] Jakub, what's going on? -[spider] Do not be afraid.
[Peter] Hello?
[Jakub] I'm losing my mind.
[Peter] Why are you in the airlock?
[Jakub] We have to decontaminate the ship!
[Peter] What? Why?
As a precaution. In case we have any onboard contaminants.
[Peter] Well, we're not seeing anything on our sensors down here.
[Jakub] I have been getting some very strange readings,
and I need to be certain before the critical stage of the mission.
I'm suiting up.
All right, you're the commander.
Give me a minute to clear this.
[Jakub] Peter, I need word.
I… [sighs] …just got a reluctant confirmation.
I'm hearing from corporate sponsorships
that they want you to say the slogan first.
[Jakub] What?
[Peter] Before you deploy the decontaminant.
The Bomba slogan.
Two, three…
Bomba is 99.999% effective
in killing any and all airborne microbial elements.
Even in space, don't let germs ruin your day.
Bomba, away!
[clicks tongue] All right. Very good. Clear to go.
[Lenka] You go where I go,
and I go where you go.
Right, Spaceman?
[Peter] Jakub?
What?
[Peter] Are you okay?
What's going on?
[Jakub] Something's not right.
[Peter] What's not right?
Jakub?
[Jakub] I'm fine.
I need to talk to Lenka.
[Peter] You need to talk to me.
I know, I know.
[Peter] Your well-being is my responsibility.
You need to be transparent with me.
I know, and I am.
[Peter sighs] Okay. The atmosphere should be back to normal in a couple of minutes.
What are your sensors saying?
[Peter] See anything unusual?
[Jakub] Not right now.
[Peter] We can have Dr. Kuřák come in if you need someone to talk to.
I don't need a psychiatrist. I'm… I'm fine.
I don't want your mental well-being to call this mission into question.
Agreed.
You don't need to worry about me.
[Peter] That is what my job is.
Six months apart in isolation, you start thinking too much.
[Jakub] Yeah, I need to get back out there, Peter.
[Peter] Okay.
[spider] I sense your fear.
But I do not mean you any harm.
You needn't worry.
I experienced no pain in my encounter with Earth's cleaning agents.
Only…
[spider] My apologies.
You do not need your protective shell.
I will neither consume nor contaminate you.
Ah. You wish to know if I am real.
Are you?
[spider] I am as real as you are.
[Jakub] You can't be.
[Peter] What was that, Jakub?
No, no, no, no, no.
Peter, it's nothing.
[spider] I would prefer you do not do that.
It is not customary for my tribe.
The body must not be violated.
Why are you here?
[spider] I am like you, an explorer.
But why are you on this vessel?
[spider] I was traveling to the edges of your solar system
when I felt the pull of humans.
I surveyed your Earth from orbit, studied your history,
learned your languages.
Yet having accessed your knowledge,
I still did not understand.
That is when I encountered your ship.
Your loneliness intrigued me.
I intended to study you a day or two, but then I wished to know more.
You compelled me.
I've come to understand that I might be of help.
I have to… [breathes shakily]
[spider] Human?
Skinny human?
I will leave you alone.
[Jakub] What's happening to me?
[Lenka] This is going to be our home, Jakub.
When you love someone, you're meant to amputate
When you love someone, you're meant to amputate a piece of what is you and replace it with a piece of the other.
a piece of what is you and replace it with a piece of the other.
[spider] Do not be afraid.
[Jakub] What is this?
Do you get that I fucking amputated so much of myself
I don't even know who I am anymore?
-What have you given up, huh? -Whatever.
Are you doing this to me?
You go where I go, and I go where you go. Right, Spaceman?
[spider] I wish to assist you in your emotional distress.
It seems your mate is pulling away.
Perhaps my presence can lessen your solitude.
I don't need your help.
But you do.
There's a place in the country for pregnant women who are alone.
They live together, eat together,
support each other through the birth and the first few weeks.
I… I don't understand.
You'd rather be surrounded by strangers in a forest?
I already canceled my lecture in Hamburg--
Be on my side, please.
I am.
I always am.
But, baby, this is a crazy time to make big decisions.
It's a crazy time to leave him.
I know.
I should have done it a long time ago.
[spider] Skinny human?
-No! No! -[spider] I need to ask about your mate.
This room's off limits.
[spider] There is a picture of you.
You are an honored member of your tribe?
This room is also off limits.
Give me those.
You have many boundaries, skinny human.
Perhaps they are the cause of your loneliness.
Get out.
[spider] Do you have any ova?
Of the avian variety.
Skinny human?
Are you referring to eggs?
[spider] Yes, I wish to sample them.
You set them in such regard.
I don't have any. They don't travel well.
Do you want to sample this?
Rich and creamy like the shtoma larvae back home.
Where is home for you exactly?
[spider] It is lost.
The Gorompeds came for us.
Just like you, I fled my planet.
Through galaxies, through black holes.
I fled through the universe, through time, looking for solace.
But then I found you.
Is this how your kind treats your feelings of loneliness?
It's one way I suppose.
[Tuma] She knew who she married.
All the qualities that make him capable of spending a year alone in space
makes him, uh… peculiar.
[woman] Will she even talk to you?
She's very pregnant and very alone.
And when you're alone, you think.
She's had too much time to think.
[spider] We have work to do.
[Lenka] You have time for this?
Thought you'd be staring up at your cloud.
[Peter] Jakub.
Jakub.
What?
[Peter] We've identified some issues with Lenka's CzechConnect.
-[Jakub] Okay. -[spider] Come.
[Jakub] When is it fixed?
[Peter] Our engineers are on it.
Yeah? Thank you.
Look, Peter, I got to get back to it.
[Peter] You do that.
[Jakub] This cloud…
it's beautiful to you too?
[spider] It holds much wisdom, skinny human.
When I was young, I caught its grains on my tongue.
They are from the Beginning.
These particles…
They are from the origin of the universe?
Is that what Chopra is?
[spider] Perhaps.
And you were there?
How old are you?
Do your kind not die?
[spider] Everything that begins must end, skinny human.
Even the universe itself.
It's pulling us in.
Is there something inside?
[spider] Yes.
[Jakub] What is it?
[spider] The Beginning.
The Beginning.
What is this?
I have a proposition for you.
You go where I go.
And I go where you go.
Deal?
-Yeah. -[chuckles]
-[Jakub] Where are you taking me? -[Lenka chuckles] Trust me!
[Jakub] Okay, I'll go where you go.
[spider] I don't understand.
Why commit to a promise if it can readily be broken?
What purpose does such a commitment serve?
Are you creating these thoughts?
[spider] No.
These are your thoughts.
I am simply finding them with you.
No, no.
I'm not allowing that.
Stop what you're doing.
[spider] Why do you resist this exploration?
Let me help you.
I don't love water.
I'm a lifeguard. I could be a lifeguard.
I will save you.
[spider] You long for your mate only once she leaves.
Suit yourself.
[spider] Why?
Where was this yearning when you were together?
I don't have any answers for you.
[spider] This strife with your Lenka,
it stirs something in me I do not recognize.
Your memories are making me…
depressed?
But the spread made of hazelnut
did make my realization seem less unpleasant.
Maybe we need to save some for later then.
Ever felt like you might evaporate?
That's how I felt.
And I have hope.
It'll get better soon.
I'll get it together. I'm not going to evaporate.
It's just that…
he can't see me.
Not really. The world down here…
We're just dots. [sniffles]
You're not a dot. [Lenka] I know.
That's what I worked out.
I do exist.
Raising a kid alone is hard.
Have you thought about what you're going to tell the baby?
I'll tell our daughter the truth.
When I married her father…
I loved him.
I loved that he was ambitious.
I was wrong.
Young people are wrong all the time.
People are wrong all the time.
Do you have a name?
What am I supposed to call you?
[spider] I have never had a name.
Would it help you to give me one?
It would.
[spider] Then name me.
Can you think of one that becomes me?
How about Hanuš?
[spider] Hanuš…
[Jakub] My father told me about him.
He built the astronomical clock in Prague.
It measured the movements of the stars and the planets.
It was like nothing else in the world.
[spider] What happened to your Hanuš?
Some king poked his eyes out.
Jealousy, I believe. It threatened his legacy.
[spider] Curious.
And the timekeeping machine?
It works now.
But I'm not sure if Hanuš built it…
or if someone else did…
or if Hanuš even exists.
I will be called Hanuš.
Good.
Hanuš.
[Hanuš] This is a tragic opera?
What is it about?
[Jakub] This is Rusalka.
A water nymph who falls in love with a mortal man.
But they can't be together.
[Hanuš] You see yourself in the star-crossed lovers.
[Lenka] Don't be scared.
[Jakub] I'm a cosmonaut in training. I'm never scared.
[Lenka] Did you always want to be a cosmonaut?
[Jakub] Well, I was supposed to raise pigs.
[Lenka] Really?
But after my father died, my dreams got bigger.
My father's dead too.
[Jakub] Where are you taking me?
[Lenka] I thought you might want to see something.
What is this?
It's a secret place.
[Hanuš] There was so much love.
Where did it go?
Please stop doing this to me.
[Hanuš] We must persist, skinny human.
[Gustav Husak, in Czech] Fellow citizens, dear comrades.
The people no longer trust in the rule of the Communist Party.
Today, I speak to you to ensure we can avoid a lawless state.
I will abdicate my role as the president of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.
I hope for a successful democratic development of our state and its people.
[in English] Were you just here listening to that all night?
I find the vibrations soothing.
At first, I entered your thoughts with you.
But I felt uncomfortable.
Your kind carries a great deal of guilt.
Yours doesn't?
No. Why should we?
The universe is as it should be.
I am removing your ban on this room, Hanuš.
For soothing purposes.
[Hanuš] What purpose does this serve?
I have to do this two hours a day to keep my bones from decaying.
[Hanuš] You chose to flee your planet,
yet that act is destructive to you.
Your father. May I ask about him?
What about him?
[Hanuš] What happened to him?
He was killed for what he believed was the truth.
[Hanuš] Your father was a martyr?
He was on the wrong side of history.
Papa!
[Jakub] My dad was a good man who did bad things.
He was an informant for the Party.
You believe this great mission will atone for the sins of your father.
You should focus more on the living, skinny human.
It's your turn to be a father now.
[softly] Baby, someone's here to see you.
[Tuma] You want to leave your husband?
I have left him.
[Tuma] No, you left him a message.
But the thing is I haven't given it to him.
Of course.
My job is to protect him.
I'm trying to protect the mother of his child.
Your mission is safe.
I assure you Jakub will be fine.
He's good on his own.
I'm sure that he's hard to live with.
But he's not doing well.
What does that mean, "he's not doing well"?
[Tuma] He misses his wife.
Then he shouldn't have left.
I'm not giving him your message.
[Tuma] There are people now at your home disabling the CzechConnect.
If you won't protect Jakub, I will.
Right now, he needs to believe
that the two of you are still a love story.
[Lenka] I'm not sure he does.
You don't leave your husband when he's in a dangerous place.
I didn't put him there.
Why can't you wait until he comes back?
[inhales deeply] I'm sorry. I can't help you.
You know, Lenka, the silence is the point.
What?
"We're both on CzechConnect and there is silence,
so what is the point?"
The silence is the point.
The two of you together,
silent, lost, afraid, in the dark,
holding on.
That is the point.
[Jakub] Speed at zero.
[Peter] Confirm SSR.
[Jakub] SSR on target. Rotation, 12 degrees. FSC engaged.
Contact. Done.
[Peter] FERDA Collection Simulation, Scenario Beta 3-3 concluded.
Great, Commander. That's perfect.
Six months in here. I know this, Peter.
[Peter] I know, but 45 hours to go.
And you'll be there first.
We're very proud of you down here.
[Jakub] Yeah.
[Lenka] Hello?
Earth to Jakub?
[Jakub] Will you stop? I really don't have time.
[Hanuš] I am not the cause of this.
[Lenka] Are you there?
[Jakub over speakers] I'm sorry.
I'm just tired and lonely.
[Lenka] I can relate.
[Jakub] I know.
Maybe you could just talk to me.
[Jakub] What do you want to talk about?
[Lenka] Anything.
[Hanuš] What is this?
You should tell me a secret.
[Jakub] Lenka, please.
This is an old conversation from months ago.
[Lenka] Remember when you…
finally told me what happened to you when you were a boy?
[Jakub] What about it?
[Lenka] How they threw you in the river because of your dad?
[Jakub] And I still don't want to talk about it.
I'm just trying to make sense of who you are, Jakub.
[Jakub] How is this even playing?
[Jakub over speakers] Who have you decided I am?
All I know is that you're someone who says that you want to come home
and then says they want to see what's beyond Jupiter.
[Jakub] Am I not allowed to dream?
Fuck!
When you dream, you leave.
[Jakub] Whatever.
[Jakub] Hanuš, is that--
[Hanuš] A grain from the Beginning!
It's Chopra!
Unbelievable!
Yes!
[Hanuš] It cannot be held, skinny human.
No! No!
[Hanuš] You have silenced my tube.
Your shameful waste will not hold what you are looking for.
Peter, I think we have an issue here.
Peter?
Peter, what the fuck?
Control, Control. Do you read?
[Jakub] Control?
Peter, do you read?
Hanuš, do you see that?
[Hanuš] The Beginning approaches.
Should I be concerned?
You have nothing to fear, skinny human.
The Beginning will not cause any harm.
It is merely a repository.
Of what?
[Hanuš] The words of your tribe cannot describe this.
Perhaps we will experience it…
together.
Control, do you read?
[Hanuš] Skinny human.
I must ask something that may upset you.
What?
The upcoming arrival of your offspring,
why should it cause your Lenka such distress?
It doesn't.
[Hanuš] Yet the flavor of her feelings is one of dread.
You mated again to create this offspring.
You speak of this offspring with excitement.
We've experienced things to fear.
[Hanuš] Show me, skinny human.
I wasn't there.
Hanuš, how can I even see this?
-[Lenka groaning] -[Jakub] I wasn't there.
[Hanuš] Your thoughts have been there, haven't they?
[Hanuš] You had the event described to you?
I just want you to come home.
But you know I can't do that.
[Lenka] I bet you could.
[Jakub] Lenka, what is Dr. Cerný saying?
[Hanuš] You were absent when your mate lost your first offspring.
You were absent thereafter.
That broke my soul.
I just feel so alone, Jakub.
[Jakub] Oh shit! Shit!
I'm having an emergency.
Let me call you back.
[Lenka] You do that.
CzechConnect keeps us connect--
[Hanuš] Again, she is with your child, and you are not there.
What for?
The pain that it causes, it is of value to you?
[woman] It's an honor to have you with us.
[Lenka] I'm sure my being here is no different to anybody else, but thank you.
Hm. Of course, but we say this to all our patrons, and we mean it.
We are humble to our task.
Whether it's by choice or by necessity,
this is not an easy thing to carry on your own.
Útočiště is your sanctuary or hinterland,
whatever you need it to be.
[Lenka] Thank you.
[Hanuš] With all our findings, you are still focused on your great discovery.
[Jakub] I'm focused on a way to reach Mission Control.
[Hanuš] We're not done.
[Jakub] Are you at least happy for me?
Of course I am. [sniffles]
I'm happy and proud of you. [sniffles]
They chose you.
[Jakub] We'll make it work.
-We're together in this. You and me. -[Lenka sniffles]
[Lenka] Promise me one thing.
Promise me we're still going to do all the things we talked about.
[Jakub] Of course. I promise.
[Hanuš] She feels your lies inside her.
[Jakub] You don't know what you're talking about.
[Hanuš] You welcomed her sadness.
All these broken pledges
except for the one you made to your great discovery.
How could you fail to see
that she, one day, would lose the will to believe in you?
Come on, come on, come on.
[Peter] This is Peter.
Peter, it's Jakub. I'm calling from the CzechConnect.
I found a way to reconfigure it.
The radio's down, but this seems to work.
I don't know if you can hear me. Peter?
[Peter chuckles nervously] We thought we lost communication.
Everyone here has been on comms duty since you went dark.
And you hacked the CzechConnect? That's unbelievable.
Yeah.
Are you okay? Is the ship okay?
Yes, everything is--
[Hanuš] There is more I want to see.
[Lenka] Please don't keep saying everything will be fine.
[Jakub] But it will.
You think too much.
I know it's a year, but we know how to do this.
[Lenka] Things happen when you're alone.
[Jakub] We'll get through it.
This is the last time.
[Lenka] You keep saying that too.
Are you frightened?
[Jakub] I told you there's nothing to be afraid of.
[Lenka] Don't you ever think about the cost?
The price we have to pay for it all?
You and me.
I'm worried. I don't know what lies ahead.
Why aren't you?
[Hanuš] With great conviction, you do not even try to understand your mate.
To what end?
It is impossible to connect with someone
who does not want to see anything but himself,
who only wants to connect when it serves him.
At first, I thought it was your kind's nature,
selfishness, shortsightedness.
But through your Lenka, I now see it.
It is you.
Your loneliness is self-inflicted.
I will leave you to your mission.
What? Hanuš!
[Hanuš] My interest in you has expired.
[Jakub] You can't leave me.
I need you.
You're helping! I'm listening to you!
[Hanuš] You can't be helped.
No!
[Hanuš] I prefer you do not place your hands on me.
You can't leave.
I need to--
[Hanuš] You need to come back with a very different discovery,
but all you can see is yourself.
Good luck, skinny human.
Hanuš.
No! Wait!
Hanuš?
Hanuš, please.
I'll do anything.
Hanuš, please. I promise.
[Jakub] What is this?
It's a secret place.
What do you think?
I think I want to live here.
[Lenka] Maybe you'd like to go on a mission together.
Maybe you'd like to trade secrets.
Maybe you'd like to kiss me.
I would.
Nice.
[Jakub] Peter!
What the hell? Where did you go?
There is a severe panic down here for all reasons I'm sure you can imagine.
Peter, everything is okay.
Nothing is deviating from plan.
The ship is doing what it was designed to do.
There's a course of action for when or if communications break down,
and I am following each of those rehearsed steps,
including fixing that problem.
Calm the fuck down.
Give me a heads-up.
Before anything, I want you to go and see Lenka.
What? Why?
Right now we have a lot going on.
-Peter. -The South Koreans are right behind you.
You are gonna go.
[Peter] To do what?
Lenka Procházka?
Oh, he's alive.
For fuck's sake, Peter!
I need to talk to you, Lenka. Five minutes, please.
I'm not here to interfere.
Whatever is going on, that's between the two of you.
But in the interest of the safety of the mission and the stakes,
I need to do what I can to alleviate Jakub's mental state right now.
I hope you can understand that.
Peter…
I can't.
He wants you to listen. That's all.
[Peter whispers] I'll be outside.
[Jakub] Lenka, I hope you're there.
I get it now. I do.
Do you remember when I said I wanted to see beyond Jupiter?
I can't imagine anything worse now.
I just want to come home.
When we met, I felt safe for the first time in my life.
And now I can't, for the life of me, understand why I kept leaving you behind
when you're the only thing that matters.
You tried hard to know me.
I am so sorry I never made a real effort to know you.
You were right there in front of me, and I didn't see you.
I have lived a life for all the wrong reasons.
What a fucking waste.
I don't deserve you.
-And I never have. -[sighs]
[Jakub] If I could do it again, I'd do it better.
[Jakub] And that's a promise I would never ever break.
If I… If I could do it again.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
[Jakub] Hanuš? I can feel you poking around.
Are you still here?
[Hanuš] You should rest now.
I-- I'd really like that.
[Hanuš] Rest.
You have purged, skinny human.
I saw it.
Rest.
I did not mean to wake you.
Don't do that to me again.
Don't leave me.
[Hanuš] I cannot let you face the Beginning alone.
I've come to understand that I don't want to be alone for that either.
Are you okay?
Wha-- What's happening to you?
[Hanuš inhales shakily] I was not entirely honest with you before.
About what?
I told you the Gorompeds came for us.
They consumed our offspring, our elders.
So I fled my world.
But I fled too late.
You're scaring me.
[Hanuš] Why fear a truth?
This is not the way of my kind,
but it is the way of humans.
I'm starting to understand why daydreams and nightmares,
they are both of essence.
[Jakub] Why didn't you say anything?
You never asked about me.
[Jakub] Hanuš, please.
You should rest, skinny human.
Tomorrow, we enter the Beginning.
This all feels like an unreal, dreamy story we tell the kids.
"The year you were born the sky was purple."
"No one knew why."
They think it's particles from deep space.
[woman] Can you imagine being up there?
No gravity. You can float away.
[Lenka] That's how I feel here sometimes.
I'd rather be here than chasing space dust.
It's a very glittery dust. [chuckles softly]
Skinny human, it is time.
Your great discovery awaits.
Thank you.
[Hanuš] The hot bean water, it is a sacred ritual.
[Jakub] Tastes like home.
Test, test, test!
[Peter] Yeah, still reading you.
Commander, I need to tell you
we initiated the broadcast of your latest pre-recording.
We all know it was an important moment for you to do that live, in person.
We had no choice with the cameras down.
You're really good in it.
It's okay, Peter.
[Tuma] Commander Procházka,
thank you for taking the time in these precious moments.
How are you feeling?
[Jakub] Commissioner Tuma, I am humbled, awed, and focused all in one breath.
To think a kid growing up in the countryside
would one day partake in this.
In just a few moments, we will deploy FERDA into Chopra,
but before that,
I just have to say how grateful I am for the support of the Czech people.
This mission is dedicated to the people of the world
and the funders and sponsors,
and to Lenka, of course.
For her endless support.
[Tuma] Two lovers connected across the stars.
I'm sure she's looking forward to having you home, safe and sound.
Everyone here on Earth is watching.
Because in just a few minutes,
the Jan Hus 1 and Commander Procházka
will be entering the Chopra Cloud.
The Czech Republic has proudly beaten the South Korean mission
to be the first to investigate the purple specter
that has haunted our sky for these past four years.
[Jakub] Arming hydraulics.
Green board.
[Hanuš whispers] We are on the doorstep to the universe.
You are ready, skinny human?
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
[Peter] Green board here, Jakub.
Count yourself to sample collection in T minus ten.
[Jakub] Speed zero.
[Peter, distorted] SSR under 20.
[Jakub] SSR at 20.
Releasing gates.
[Jakub] Arm engaged.
Rotation, eight degrees.
FERDA is deploying for collection.
But it might be a pointless endeavor.
[Peter, distorted] We can't hear you, Jakub. Our… [static] …irregularities.
Control, we're getting some interference.
[Peter] We read… We read you now.
[distorted] Clear for the sample collection.
[Jakub] FSC engaged.
Contact.
Attempting collection.
[Hanuš] Skinny human.
I've never heard such silence before.
Hanuš!
[Peter] Commander, what is happening?
-[Peter] We have negative reading… -Hanuš! …from sample collection.
-Something is wrong. -Hanuš!
[Peter] System failure from FERDA.
Abort sample collection immediately.
Hanuš!
[Peter] We are recording numerous malfunctions, Commander.
You have to pull out immediately.
Abort the mission!
[Peter] You have catastrophic system failure.
Jakub, we cannot hear you.
The indicators are showing irregularities.
[Hanuš] Fear not, skinny human.
[Jakub] Hanuš! Hold on! I'm coming!
[Peter] Abort the sample collection
-and engage thrusters. -No! No, I can't.
[Peter] What are you doing with the Bomba?
Commander, pull out now! Please repeat!
[Peter] Commander, what is happening?
[Peter] Why are you in the airlock?
Suit sensors are engaged.
Peter, I'm going out!
Are you fucking crazy?
Forget Chopra, Commander.
Pull out! Save yourself!
[Jakub] There's something I've gotta do! I'll be right back!
[Peter] Commander, we can't read you!
Come in, Commander!
[Jakub] Come on, come on, come on!
[Jakub] Hanuš!
[Jakub] Hanuš!
Are you okay? Did the Bomba work?
[Hanuš] Skinny human, your efforts with the decontaminant were heroic.
But soon, the Gorompeds will weaken me enough to consume my flesh.
But we have a little time.
Death will not yet find me.
[Jakub] Hanuš.
I almost drowned when I was a boy.
This reminds me of that.
I could see the sun through the water, green and flickering.
I knew then I was drowning,
but the sun would go on shining.
Oh, Dad. I absolve you of your sins,
and I absolve me of them too.
[Hanuš] Beautiful.
This isn't such a bad place to end things.
[Hanuš] This isn't the end.
Come. Let me show you.
[Jakub] We only just met but I'd be okay with it.
[Jakub] This is why I don't tell the truth.
What is this?
[Hanuš] Skinny human, this is it.
This is everything.
This is the Beginning and the ending.
[Hanuš] Every vibration of all time.
It is all contained here.
[Peter] Great, Commander. That's perfect.
[Hanuš] Your past and your future.
[boy] Hey! Wait for me!
[Hanuš] Me, you, your Lenka…
[Lenka] You go where I go, and I go where you go. Right, Spaceman?
[Hanuš] Your father.
[man] Jakub!
[Hanuš] Every promise. Every heartbreak.
[Lenka] Earth to Jakub?
[Hanuš] Every atonement.
[boy] I'm coming!
[Hanuš] Everything is permanent, yet nothing ever is.
[Jakub] Really? It's tiny?
That is the truth of the universe.
[Lenka] You ever think about what you've learned a little bit late in life?
[Jakub] Maybe I'm not at that point yet.
[Hanuš] No one has to hurt, not here where you can see everything.
not here where you can see everything.
Hanuš! Incredible!
[Hanuš] Skinny human, the universe is as it should be.
[Jakub] Yes, it is.
How little I knew.
But there's one thing I've always known.
Come, let me show you.
[Hanuš] This is the Beginning.
With your Lenka.
You all right there, Spaceman?
[Jakub] The first moment I saw her, I knew I wanted good things for her.
If I don't know anything else, I know that.
If only I saw her always like I saw her then.
[Hanuš] That you saw her at all is a miracle.
[Jakub] It's all so unlikely that she and I would meet,
that you and I would meet.
[Hanuš] Yet here we are.
You thought this was everything you wanted,
so what's not here, Jakub?
[Jakub] She's not here.
It's time, isn't it?
I feel you slipping away.
[Hanuš] Yes, it is inevitable.
It's not without some fear,
but I can leave you now.
[Jakub] I brought something for you.
For soothing.
[Hanuš] Thank you.
I begin and I end here.
[Hanuš gasps] But perhaps this is not your ending, skinny human.
Now I feel fear.
[Hanuš] As you do.
But you also feel hope for you, your Lenka.
That is the wisdom of your tribe.
Can you hear her?
[Jakub] I can't hear anything.
[Hanuš] Listen to the silence.
Thank you, Hanuš. For everything.
[Hanuš] Tastes like home.
No. No!
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, Hanuš.
[Jakub] Rusalka…
I just want a kiss.
You know that will kill you.
[softly] I'm good with that.
Lenka.
Jakub.
[Jakub] Thank you.
If I had known then what I know now,
I never would have left.
If I had known then what I know now,
would I have kissed you?
Would you?
a species much like our own,
capable of great compassion
and great violence.
For in our quest to protect the humans,
a deeper revelation dawns.
Our worlds have met before.
FEMALE ANNOUNCER 1: Newsflash from the BBC.
MALE ANNOUNCER: Breaking news out of Shanghai.
There's been a major toxic spill
in the Shanghai factory district.
FEMALE ANNOUNCER 2: We're staying
on top of this developing story for you.
We will bring you any new information as we get it.
WOMAN: NEST Seahawks approaching target.
SOLDIER: Three minutes until evacuation is complete, sir.
Chinese airspace has been locked and sealed, one-mile radius.
Chinese airspace has been locked and sealed, one-mile radius. All right, give NEST team the go.
All right, give NEST team the go. Black Hawks, you're clear to land.
Ding-a-ling! Come out and get your ice cream.
Any bad robot out there better get ready for an ass-whupping.
OPTIMUS: For the last two years,
an advance team of new Autobots
has taken refuge here under my command.
MAN ON PA: Arcees, get ready to launch.
We're locked and loaded.
OPTIMUS: Together, we form an alliance with the humans,
a secret but brave squad of soldiers.
All right, listen up. China's cover story on this one is "toxic spill."
They had to evac the area for search and rescue.
This makes six enemy contacts in eight months.
We gotta make sure this one does not
get out in the public eye, so keep it tight.
OPTIMUS: A classified strike team called NEST.
We hunt for what remains of our Decepticon foes
hiding in different countries around the globe.
SOLDIER: Roll in Alpha through Echo now.
Move out! Let's go!
All right, Ironhide. We got echoes. Vamos.
Steel stacks at 2 o'clock.
He's here. I smell him.
It's close. It's getting closer.
-Oh, no. -What have you got?
Thermal ripple.
Right, everybody, be steady. We're right on top of it.
Eagle niner!
SOLDIER: I need an energy proton.
Panther 1, requesting fire mission now!
Gunships on station. Roll in hot!
PILOT: Dog 1, now we are engaging.
We got a second Decepticon.
Arcee twins! Target coming your way!
I got him, I got him!
I screwed that up. I'm okay. I'm all right.
This is combat, man.
Total brain freeze, man.
What's wrong with you?
Bring in Sideswipe!
Clear a path.
Damn, I'm good!
Air support, we need Big Buddha to deliver the drop now!
PILOT: Cyclone 98, final attack hitting in 120.
Clear to drop in five, four, three, two, one.
Autobots, I'm in pursuit!
Pull over!
Punk-ass Decepticon!
Any last words?
This is not your planet to rule!
The Fallen shall rise again.
That doesn't sound good.
Not today.
RON: Come on, let's go! All hands on deck!
Frankie, Mojo, out! Come on, kiddo, we're on a schedule.
SAM: Slow down, Dad. Why are you in such a hurry to get rid of me?
Did you rent the room out? No, I got other ideas for your room
and it rhymes with "home theater."
Look what I found. It's your little baby booties.
Oh, Ma.
My little baby-bootie boy.
-You can't go. -You see this, Dad? This is how
you're supposed to react when the fruit of your loins
goes out into the cruel world to fend for himself, okay?
Yeah, my heart bleeds for you, pal. College, bummer!
You have to come home every holiday, not just big ones.
You have to come home every holiday, not just big ones. You have to come home for Halloween.
You have to come home for Halloween.
Well, I can't come home for Halloween, Mom. -Well, then we'll come to you. -You're not coming.
-Well, then we'll come to you. -You're not coming. -No, we're not going anywhere. -We'll dress up.
We'll be in costumes. You'll never know it's us.
You can't do that, Mom. Would you let the kid breathe,
for crying out loud? Come on. Go pack.
There's no way you're packed for a month-long trip.
Come on, chop, chop! Let's go. March, young lady.
Oh, Dad.
I love it when you call me "young lady,"
-You dirty old man. -You ain't seen nothing yet.
-Dad, Dad, Dad, whoa! -What?
I'm watching what you're doing, Dad. It's not a rap video.
It's just like a coach thing.
That was a really creepy move just now, Dad.
Look. You know, your mother and me are really proud of you.
You're the first Witwicky ever to go to college.
Now I'm crying again! This sucks!i
You're gonna be okay, Ma.
You know, it's just going to be,
you know, hard for her to accept
that her boy's all grown up, you know,
going out to handle the world on his own.
-You okay, Pop? -Yeah.
(DOG WHIMPERING) Mojo, no dominating Frankie.
Get the hell off the couch, you filthy beasts. Wow!
You'll see a lot of that in college, too.
What are you talking about, Dad?
There's gonna be a lot of women there.
Yeah, well, I'm a one-woman kind of guy.
Look, Mikaela's the greatest,
but you gotta give each other room to grow, okay?
You're no different than any other couple your age.
Except we discovered an alien race together.
(SCOFFS) How long you gonna be riding that scooter?
Dad, listen, I know what the odds are. We're the exception, okay?
Wait a second. Who could that be?
In two weeks, it could be Muffy.
Hey, beautiful.
-I'm breaking up with you, Sam. -Really?
You sure? I'm not hearing a lot of conviction.
Well, I am, okay? So, there's no reason
for me to come say good-bye to you.
Wow, you almost sounded serious that time.
Guess what? I made you a long-distance relationship kit.
Yeah, I got you a webcam, so we can chat 24/7.
All Witwicky, all the time.
And I got you  a couple souvenirs from the event
that cannot be mentioned on cell phones.
Some mixes and candles and stuff.
Sounds cute. I can't wait.
Hey! You want the infamous D-Day shirt?
You kept your nasty, shredded clothes?
Yeah. Of course, I kept it, Mikaela.
It's like my Super Bowl jersey. I bled in this thing.
Wow. You're pretty confident, huh? No, it's not that.
It's just that my low self-esteem's at an all-time high.
You think your little box of souvenirs
is gonna keep me from leaving you?
You really should come with me.
They got cheap apartments near campus.
Well, that's not gonna happen until I get my man-child father,
fresh out of prison, back on his feet.
I heard that. Where'd you put the clutch covers?
MIKAELA: Next to the camshafts.
(EXCLAIMS) I love it when you say "camshafts."
Whisper it to me.
Camshafts.
Why can't I hate you?
SAM: It's my Witwicky charm.
Wait, hold on. Wait, hold on a second.
I guess we're not breaking up. I'll be over in 20.
Mikaela, I think a sliver of the Cube got stuck on my shirt.
Sam?
There's a fire! Dad, we got a fire!
SAM: Fire!
(CRYING) Ron, did you know it was gonna be this hard?
Can you just stop?
Yeah, okay, I'll stop. You carry this shit!
(EXCLAIMS) -Wow. -Do you know what?
-What? -I don't want to go anywhere with you.
I don't wanna go to France with you.
I don't wanna go around the corner with you.
-I'm going back inside. -All right, fine.
I'll call you from Paris. (KITCHENBOTS GROWLING)
What is all the racket?
-Whoa! -Sam?
Dad!
-What was that? -That's the whole kitchen.
RON: Bumblebee... Oh, my...
Bumblebee!
911.
SAM: Bumblebee!
Get in the garage. Go!
JUDY: What the freak just happened?
SAM: I'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
Just go in the garage quietly, please.
Holy Mother!
JUDY: Oh, my God!
Whatever.
Get in the garage now!
JUDY: Firemen! Fire fighters, over here!
RON:Dogs out! Get the dogs out!
This is it!
Come on, you guys. What are you waiting for?
JUDY: My house is on fire!
...very important.
What happened?
Come here. Listen, I need you to take the Cube sliver and put it in your purse.
-What's going on? -Just take it.
-Sam Witwicky. A word with you? -Yes, Mom. Yeah.
-Hi, Mikaela. I have a bald spot. -Hi.
An old furnace, I think.
JUDY: From a waffle iron.
When you go, he goes.
I cannot live with a psychotic alien in my garage.
(SHUSHING) Judy... National Security.
Look, if we stay quiet, they're gonna take care of everything.
Just consider this the official start of our remodel, okay?
Fine. If the government's paying, I want a pool and a hot tub.
And I'm gonna skinny-dip and you can't say shit about it!
(EXCLAIMING) Yeah, you know you're in trouble.
He still having voice problems?
He's playing it up.
Bee, I want to talk to you about the college thing, okay?
WOMAN SINGING ON RADIO: ♪ I'm so excited and I just can't hide it ♪
SAM: Hey, I'm not taking you with me.
I'm gonna wait outside, okay?
SAM: I meant to tell you about this earlier.
It's just that, you know... Here's the thing.
Freshmen aren't allowed to have cars.
I know, and if it was up to me,
I'd take you with me, but it's not, Bee.
Look. You're an Autobot. You shouldn't be living in my dad's garage.
Look. You're an Autobot. You shouldn't be living in my dad's garage. I mean, you're suffocating in here.
You deserve better than this.
This is hard enough, man. Don't make it harder.
Can you just look at me, please?
Come on, big guy. Look, the guardian thing is done.
Okay? You did your job. Look, I'm safe now.
You need to go be with Optimus Prime and the others.
I just want to be normal, Bee.
That's why I'm going to college,
and I can't do that with you.
It's not the last time I'm gonna see you, you know, Bee.
Come on, don't do that. Bee.
You're killing me, Bee.
But you'll always be my first car.
Love you, Bee.
(EXCLAIMS) Wow!
Between State Farm and the taxpayers, we're all taken care of.
-You got dirt all over you. -Stop. Stop.
-What? -Stop, I'm okay.
-What? -Stop, I'm okay. Look.
So, you think you can make it through
those East Coast winters without me?
You're the best thing to ever happen to me.
And?
And I'll do anything for you.
And?
I think Sam's about to say the L-word.
I think Sam's about to say the L-word. Let's go, kiddo.
Nice timing, Dad.
I adore you.
That's not the word that I want
-to hear right now. -What are you talking about? It's the same word as the other word.
It's not the same word. If I say the other word now
and you forced me to say it, it won't mean anything, plus
you haven't said it either. So, don't get mad at me for not saying it.
Yeah, but I haven't said it because guys
always run when you say it first.
So do girls. Especially girls like you, with options.
So, this is all part of your elaborate plan to keep me interested?
It can be.
I hate that it's working.
Can I have a kiss?
We're going to make it work, I promise.
FEMALE HAS SLIVER FROM CUBE
Soundwave acknowledges. Pursue her.
Retrieve it.
MAN ON PA: Autobot twins, report to Hangar Three.
(HORN HONKING) Bad-ass ice-cream truck coming through.
Excuse me! Excuse me! Hello! No, I don't...
Hold up. Those are nice.
Yeah, baby, it's upgrade time.
Yes, sir. Yeah! Look here, it's my booty call right here!
Time to get my sexy on with the green.
Green? No, green is mine.
I call green.
-I got the green. -That hurt, man.
It's supposed to hurt. It's an ass-kicking.
SOLDIER: Present arms!
LENNOX: Director Galloway, what an honor.
I'd love to show you around,
but you gotta be on the classified access list.
I am now. Presidential order, Major.
I got a message for your classified space buddies.
You guys made a mess of Shanghai.
All right, so this is where we communicate with the JCS
and this area serves as the Autobots' hangar.
SOLDIER: Secure link to JCS is up, Major.
U.S. MILITARY SATELLITE
SOLDIER ON RADIO: Secure line to the Pentagon is now open.
LENNOX: General?
Will, I saw the Shanghai Op.
GENERAL: We had a rough day out there. LENNOX: Yes, sir.
We have intel that I believe warrants an immediate debrief.
Now with your permission, I can't let you see him,
but I would like you to hear from the leader of the Autobots.
Proceed.
You gotta wonder,
if God made us in his image, who made him?
General, our alliance has countermanded
six Decepticon incursions this year,
each on a different continent.
They're clearly searching around the world for something,
but last night's encounter came with a warning.
DECEPTICON ON RECORDING: "The Fallen shall rise again."
"The Fallen." Meaning what?
OPTIMUS: Origin unknown. The only recorded history of our race
was contained within the AllSpark
and lost with its destruction.
Excuse me!
With this so-called AllSpark now destroyed,
With this so-called AllSpark now destroyed, why hasn't the enemy left the planet like you thought they would?
Director Galloway, our National Security Advisor.
The President just appointed him liaison.
Well, I guess I didn't get that memo.
GALLOWAY: Forgive the interruption, General.
Excuse me. Coming through.
Excuse me. Excuse me, soldier.
After all the damage in Shanghai,
the President is hard-pressed to say the job's getting done.
Now, under the classified Alien/Autobot Cooperation Act,
you agreed to share your intel with us,
but not your advancements in weaponry.
We've witnessed your human capacity for war.
It would absolutely bring more harm than good.
But who are you to judge what's best for us?
With all due respect, we've been fighting side by side
in the field for two years.
We've shed blood, sweat and precious metal together.
Soldier, you're paid to shoot, not talk.
Don't tempt me.
GALLOWAY: And the newest members of your team.
GALLOWAY: And the newest members of your team. OPTIMUS: Easy.
GALLOWAY: I understand they arrived here
after you sent a message into space,
an open invitation to come to Earth,
vetted by no one at the White House.
Let me stop you right there, Mr. Galloway.
It was vetted right here.
And in my experience, the judgment
of both Major Lennox and his team
has always been above reproach.
Well, be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President
that when our national security is at stake,
no one is above reproach.
Now, what do we know so far?
We know that the enemy leader, classified NBE One, aka Megatron,
classified NBE One, aka Megatron,
is rusting in peace at the bottom of the Laurentian Abyssal,
surrounded by SOSUS detection nets
and a full-time submarine surveillance.
We also know that the only remaining piece of your alien AllSpark
is locked in an electromagnetic vault
here on one of the most secure naval bases in the world.
SOUNDWAVE: Decepticons, we have located the shard.
And since no one can seem to tell me what the enemy is now after,
well, there's only one clear conclusion.
You! The Autobots!
They're here to hunt you.
What's there to hunt for on Earth besides that?
"The Fallen shall rise again"?
It sounds to me like something's coming.
So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude
So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude that our national security is best served
by denying you further asylum on our planet,
will you leave peacefully?
Freedom is your right.
If you make that request, we will honor it.
But before your President decides, please ask him this.
What if we leave and you're wrong?
That's a good question.
(BELL RINGING) Oh, my gosh! Look at this place.
I feel smarter already.
Ron, can you smell it?
Yeah, smells like $40,000 a year.
Hey, cheapo.
Hey, go ahead. We'll get your stuff.
Just go ahead and check out your room. Yeah, go.
-Hey. -Hey.
-You must be Sam, right? -I'm Leo.
Hey.
So, I already set up the crib a bit.
You want this side or that side?
-That side. -I already chose that side.
You know what this is? This is the awkward moment.
Yeah, see, you're trying to see if I'm a normal guy.
I'm trying to see if you're a normal guy.
Balanced, unmedicated, nothing under the crawl space.
Good hygiene, won't stab me.
No criminal record, won't steal anything.
-Including girlfriends. -Especially girlfriends.
-You got a girlfriend? -I do. You?
(LAUGHING) No, not a chance.
You a techie?
Sweet! Sharsky, Fassbinder, where we at?
FASSBINDER: Server's almost online, Leo.
SHARSKY: Network's up and running.
Beautiful, that's what I like to hear.
That's Sharsky, that's Fassbinder, my IT gurus.
Welcome to my empire, bro, TheRealEffingDeal.com.
That's me, I'm sure you've heard of it.
-No, I haven't. -Well, that sucks.
-What is all this for? -LEO: See where I'm going, bro.
Look, call me gross, I want to be a baby billionaire.
Kitten calendars. That's where I started. Look at me now.
Got to have dreams, bro.
Leo! We got some brand-new Shanghai vid.
Post it, baby. Go, go, go! FTJ! FTJ!
What's "FTJ"?
"Fuel the Jet."
Fuel the Jet, bro.
FASSBINDER: FTJ. FTJ, legit!
Did you see that? Did you see that?
Look at this. Half of Shanghai gets
wrecked and China says "gas leak."
Don't believe the hype, bro.
SHARSKY: Just like the alien robots in LA two years ago
SHARSKY: Just like the alien robots in LA two years ago that everyone covered up.
Yeah, I saw these robots, and they did this, like, firing thing
Yeah, I saw these robots, and they did this, like, firing thing and they came down and toasted
this woman, and she was like...
-It looks fake to me. -FASSBINDER: Dude, it's not fake.
The Internet is pure truth. Video doesn't lie.
-It looks fake. -No, man, I've seen them.
They're, like, these robots...
Look, look, it's fake.
Anybody could do it on any computer, okay?
And I wasn't there,
so I can't comment or speculate.
-No. -"Comment or speculate"?
-No. -"Comment or speculate"? And we're supposed to cohabitate?
No, listen, okay? Don't be sucking the sack, bro.
-Which sack? -The ball sack.
Dude, what kind of tool are you?
Mainstream media sack.
They're lying to us, all right?
-It's aliens, man. -Okay, okay.
Follow me.
Uh-oh! Leo, bad news.
We just got scooped. The video's already up on GFR.
Fassbinder!
(GRUNTS) Robo-Warrior, the guy's our main
competition on conspiracy stuff.
"Effing" was my F-ing idea and he stole it.
He's been linking to my site and thieving hits forever.
By the way, I read your file. I'm poor, you're poor. We're gonna fix that, all right? You work for me now.
We're gonna fix that, all right? You work for me now.
I work for you now? That's incredible.
I work for you now? That's incredible. It's first day of college, I got a career in a dinky Internet firm
with a boss who is made up of just pure champion stuff.
Are you mocking my life's work, Samuel?
That's your one warning patrolling, dude. Don't make me
have Fassbinder hack your financial aid, 'cause I'll do it.
Hey, RA. Listen, it's getting a little intense in my room.
Can I switch out?
Sad face, 312. No switching, no trading.
Let's turn that frown upside down, okay?
Oh, here we go. We made it. Hi.
It's just like Hogwarts.
-Hi. -Is this co-ed?
-This is a co-ed dorm. -You guys want
-to meet my roommates? -JUDY: Yeah. Some real swell guys.
-Here's Leo. -We're the Witwickys.
-I'm Leo. -I'm Judy.
Hey, you have a great son, you really do.
Well, aren't you the sweetest thing?
Yeah, he's real sweet, Ma.
What is that in your hand, by the way?
I got this at the bake sale for the environment
that those boys are having.
You know, you don't often see white boys
with the dreadlocks.
-Mom? -Yeah, it's 100% pure,
Hawaiian green for the environment.
Hawaiian green for the environment. -How many have you eaten? -Drop it.
-SAM: What is this? -Yeah, they baked it with reefer.
-No, it's... -Please, give me...
Hey! It's my cheat day. I can eat what I want.
I'm going to freak out. Please do something right now, Dad.
Please do something right now.
I can eat all the fricking brownies I want.
Come on, let's go.
I'm sorry and you're welcome.
We call it the "Hot Freshman 55."
Sharsky hacked Campus Housing
and stacked the dorm with pretty Betties.
Is... Is so nice...
Oh, my God. That's her. She's coming. She sees me, she sees me.
She's tied for number one on my to-do list.
Do not bird-dog my quail, you hear me?
Pretty girls! Hey, you. My son lives in this dorm.
You should go make friends with him. He's Sam.
MALE STUDENT: Glad she ain't my mama.
And he recently had his cherry popped.
(ALL GIGGLING) He didn't know I was in the house. I heard it all.
-Hey, hey, hey! -Here he is.
He would get in my closet and dress up as Boy Spice.
Hey, and his car is a talking robot!
No, like the GPS. OnStar!
-OnStar. -JUDY: Frisbee.
(JUDY WHOOPING) No, Dad. Dad, you just gonna
let her run around the school?
Give it. Mine, mine, mine.
Give it. Mine, mine, mine. MAN: Hey! Crazy!
You want it?
I want it.
Judy, Judy, just... Just put it down.
-You gotta control your mother. -I don't know who this woman is.
Hey, Professor, I'd do anything for an A.
All right, Grace Slick. We got some snacks in the car.
Let's go.
Did you get the booties? All right.
Did you get the booties? All right. Yes, Dad, I got the booties!
I'm upside down.
Black Lion X-Ray, this is Black Lion Tango.
We have activation of motion sensors
We have activation of motion sensors on the western perimeter fence.
MAN ON PA: Breach at B-14.
Go, go, go, go!
SOLDIER: The shard's gone.
(CREATURE HISSES) Contact!
SOLDIER 1: Take it down!
SOLDIER 2: Which way? SOLDIER 3: Shoot left.
Knock it down.
First frat party's the game changer.
Boys, we're hunting in the wild now.
So, get your game faces on.
I can't stay long. I have a webcam date with my girlfriend.
-That's so cool! -No, it's not.
While he's making out with his MacBook,
I'm gonna be getting my Spitzy freaky freak on.
Let's roll.
She's hot.
Bro, we're hunting.
-See you, darling. -Bye, Dad.
Okay.
This is our first live chat date. I've never done it before.
I'm kind of nervous.
-GIRL: Are you okay? -No.
I was getting a napkin for my drink.
Thanks. Cheers.
-It's Sam, right? -Yeah.
I wanna dance.
What, like... Like dancing?
Like a pairing? Like a duo? Like a coupling?
'Cause I'm in a permanently semi...
I'm in a relationship, kind of...
Relax. I just want to have some fun.
Wanna have some fun?
Yeah, okay. Let's play some checkers. You can sit over there and...
Oh, my...
So, how about tonight
you pretend I'm your girlfriend
and I pretend that you're my boyfriend?
Hey! Who drove the freaking yellow Camaro?
There is a car on the lawn
What are you doing?
MAN ON RADIO: Houston, we have a problem.
-What is it? -FRAT GUY: Freshman!
-Yeah? -Is that your car in our bushes?
No, there's a friend of mine.
He just went to get you a tighter shirt.
There isn't a tighter shirt. We checked.
Now how about I park my foot in your ass?
-What size shoe do you wear? -Yeah?
-Hold on. -FRAT GUY: You wanna try?
SAM: I'll back it up right now.
Get him out of here. You have a ride? Bro, why are you holding out on us?
You have a ride? Bro, why are you holding out on us?
I've only known you 17 hours.
LEO: This is gonna really change our lives. You have no idea.
I love Camaros.
I can't do this right now, okay?
-Don't be a wimp. -Oh, God!
My first car was my dad's '92 Z28.
Yeah?
Fuel-injected.
The roar of the engine, it just tickles me.
We shouldn't stare...
I mean, share stories with each other at all.
Come on, Sam. Just one ride.

I got Wetnaps for your face. Hold on.
I... I'm so sorry.
What are you doing?
You won't give me a day, huh?
You won't give me one day in college?
I'm sorry, Sam,
but the last fragment of the AllSpark was stolen.
Like what? Like Decepticons stole it?
We placed it under human protection at your government's request,
but I'm here for your help, Sam,
because your leaders believe
we brought vengeance upon your planet.
Perhaps they are right.
That is why they must be reminded
by another human of the trust we share.
This isn't my war.
Not yet... but I fear it soon will be.
Your world must not share the same fate as Cybertron.
Whole generations lost.
I know, and I want to help you, I do,
but I am not some alien ambassador, you know?

You're Optimus Prime. You don't need me.
We do, more than you know.
U.S.S. TOPEKA, SSN - 754 ON RADIO: Conn, Sonar.
Gained new contact, bearing 214, and possible hostile,
confirmed for Project Deep Six Drop Point.
What do you got?
SU pulled five contacts at 5,000 feet,
diving fast.
Never seen anything dive that deep that fast.
Man battle stations.
Chief of the watch, man battle stations.
Helm, left full rudder, all ahead two-thirds.
Left full rudder, two-thirds.
CHIEF: Dive, go deep.
The nets protecting NBE One are screaming, sir.
That is 9,300 fathoms down.
And no confirmed DSRVs on site?
-None, sir. -Then we've got a problem.
Need parts. Kill the little one.
The shard make Energon.
Conn, Sonar. Now hold six contacts, and they're coming up fast.
Sound collision alarm.
SOLDIER: Left hard rudder.
Five hundred feet.
Angel Six, we got six hostiles coming up.
Collision imminent port side.
One hundred feet.
Brace for impact.
Starscream, I'm home.
Lord Megatron, I was so relieved to hear of your resurrection.
You left me to die on that pathetic insect planet.
Only to help spawn our new army. The Fallen decrees it!
After all, in your absence,
someone had to take command.
So disappointing.
Hatchlings. Hatchlings. Careful, fragile!
Even in death, there is no command but mine.
My master, I failed you on Earth.
The AllSpark is destroyed and without it, our race will perish.
You have much to learn, my disciple.
The Cube was merely a vessel.
Its power, its knowledge, can never be destroyed.
It can only transform.
It can only transform. How is that possible?
It has been absorbed by the human child.
The key to saving our race now lies within his mind.
Well, then, let me strip the very flesh from his body.
And you will, my apprentice, in time.
For millennia, I have dreamed of my return to that wretched planet
where I, too, was once betrayed
by the Primes I called my brothers.
Only a Prime can defeat me, and now, only one remains.
Optimus! He protects the boy.
Then the boy will lead us to him
and revenge will be ours.
Yes.
The boy will not escape us.
We have him in our sights.
Without more Energon,
the hatchlings will keep dying.
Space. Time. Gravity.
Thank you.
Finish that for me.
We're going on a journey together, you and I, today.
All you eager, nubile, young minds
on the very cusp of adulthood.
And I shall be your consort, your guide,
your chaperone, into the heart of darkness.
(HIGH-PITCHED RINGING) Welcome to Astronomy 101.
For what do we know about the stars?
Virgo, the virgin.
Orion, the great hunter.
These are no mere twinkling diamonds
for lovely maidens to wish upon.
No, they are dynamos
filled with a throbbing, savage and pent-up energy.
Behold the work of Albert Einstein, a professor once, like moi.
-Energy equals mass... -What you doing?
LEO: Put your hand down. Put your hand down.
Young man, there are no questions
until I've reached the climax of my lecture.
I just finished your book and there's a problem. Einstein's wrong.
Energy does equal mass times the velocity of light squared in this dimension, but what about the other 17?
of light squared in this dimension, but what about the other 17?
We haven't even talked about the other 17.
Clear example.
Break down the elemental components of Energon,
assume a constant decay rate and extrapolate for each of the...
Fourteen galactic convergences it took
the Sentinel Prime expedition to receive an... Echo on its signal,
you wind up with a formula for inter-dimensional energy increase
that mass and light alone can't possibly explain.
Come on, guys, I can't be the only one in the class who...
Young man, I will not be punk'd in front of the Dean.
No, this is my universe here.
Do you understand? I am the alpha and the omega.
-Get out of my class. -Yes, sir. (STUDENTS LAUGHING)
Anyone else care to have some sort of mental breakdown?
Hi, Bones! Hi. Hi. Oh, you're such a good boy.
(DISTORTED) What a good boy, you are.
Hey, Bones. Are you hungry?
Come on, check that out.
There you go.
-Yes, Samuel? -Hello? Mikaela?
I can't believe you're gonna stand me up
on our first web chat date.
Something just happened to me, okay?
What, you finally hit puberty?
No, no, no. Stop laughing. This is serious. Okay.
Remember I was telling you about my great-great-grandfather,
Archibald Witwicky? Remember?
Watch it, watch it, watch... No!
Okay, remember how I was telling you...
Okay. Can you stop? Watch the foot. Watch your foot.
Mikaela, okay, my great-great-grandfather
went on this Arctic mission, right?
And he saw Megatron. Megatron zapped him,
and he started seeing these crazy symbols. Okay.
Well, now I'm seeing them, too. Excuse me.
I just read a 903-page astronomy book in 32.6 seconds.
I had a meltdown in the middle of my class.
I am seeing symbols ever since I...
Since what?
Ever since I touched the Cube splinter.
Do you have it?
MIKAELA: Yeah, I have it.
It's in the shop safe. It's fine.
Mikaela, do not touch it, okay?
-Don't touch it. -I'm not gonna touch it.
Sam, it's fine. It's locked away.
No one knows where it is.
WHEELIE: I do.
You're hot, but you ain't too bright.
There we go. Yeah, that'll work.
Ow! Damn it! Son of a bitch!
What are you looking at, slobber puss?
What the... This place is a freaking house of horrors.
Pain... It hurts...
Hold on.
Right to five, then...
Is that the best you got, huh?
Is that the best you got, huh? Is that the best you can do?
What are you doing here, you little freak?
Ow! That's my eye, you crazy bitch!
You gonna talk now?
I seek knowledge from the Cube.
I seek knowledge from the Cube. -The Fallen demands me! -What knowledge?
You got the shard, I need the shard.
Give me the shard. I need the shard.
I'm gonna be dead without that shard.
Easy, warrior goddess, I'm just a little salvage-scrap drone.
And I'm your worst nightmare.
Hey, hey, hey.
-What the hell was that? -I'll tell you later,
just not on an open phone line, okay?
I'm gonna get on a plane right now and I'll be there later this afternoon. Just be careful, Sam.
and I'll be there later this afternoon. Just be careful, Sam.
And have any strangers given you
anything suspicious to carry on today?
WHEELIE: Yeah, a live bomb!
-No. -Good.
Major, incoming SOS from Autobots!
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion.
Vicinity, eastern United States, sir.
As in how many?
Unclear, sir.
Well, get clear.
The Autobots are on the move,
splitting into two teams, sir.
They're not answering our calls
and they're heading to New York and Philadelphia.
Full weapons deployment. Wheels up in 20 minutes!
Move it!
Let's go!
PILOT ON PA: Flight 57, welcome to Philadelphia.
LEO: Alicia, mi amor,
can I interest you in an 18-inch Zookeeper's special?
Extra-large, triple cheese, with every known animal as a topping.
Basically, I've got, like, 18 inches of meat.
Unless you're vegetarian. All right. It's cool. I am, too.
-Sam home? -Sam? I think he died,
but why don't we check?
-Here we are. -SAM: Hey.
You ever have a song stuck in your head? It's like
the worst song ever, but you can't help to whistle it or sing it
'cause it, like, repeats itself, repeats itself,
repeats itself, repeats itself?
Kitten calendar, kitten calendar, kitten calendar,
-kitten calendar... -Dude, what the eff?
I know you're freaking out. Don't freak out. Don't freak out.
Easy fix. Puzzle code in my head.
Now it's on the walls. Everything is good.
This is the part that...
Okay, what were you saying?
Alice, I'm horrified you had to see this. Let's go.
ALICE: Get out.
Wait, wait, wait! Can I just sit and watch?
I'll... I'll eat my pizza quietly.
Sam, I knew there was something special about you.
Really?
And I know you know what happens
when two people in the know get together.
They're genuinely amazing in bed.
Thank you.
All right, listen, hold on! Boundaries.
Flag on the play. Okay. I'm very ticklish. We have needs, Sam. Relax.
We have needs, Sam. Relax.
Jeez!
What about this economy? It's crazy, isn't it?
You are very aggressive.
Just relax.
You want some turkey meatloaf?
Sam?
Mikaela!
Is that your girlfriend?
-Mmm-hmm. -Ex.
Mikaela! Wait!
I can explain... (CHOKING)
Sam, your bed buddy, Alice...
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
All right, come on. She's coming.
She's an alien robot. You gotta move.
-LEO: Is this real? -Just run.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I can't believe
I almost had sex with her in my dream!
I can tell that you really missed me a lot, Sam.
-Look, it's not my fault, okay? -It's not your fault?
Listen! Listen, I'm a victim.
-You were a victim? Of what? -Yeah.
-Of what, little 80-pound girl? -Of... Of molestation.
It was like getting humped in the neck by a mountain ox.
You didn't have to put your tongue in her mouth.
-I didn't! Look! -You did!
You ever had your stomach tongued by
a mountain ox with a five-foot tongue?
It's not fun for me, okay, Mikaela?
And it smelled like... Like diesel!
Like a diesel-y tinge to it.
You're such a little girl.
We're gonna have 10 seconds of silence right now.
I'm not talking to you for 10 seconds.
You can't give me the silent treatment! You know what?
I'm not talking to you for 10 seconds. You have three seconds left.
You know what? You can give me the silent treatment
all you want, but you can't keep me from talking.
-What were you gonna say? -I hope you had a lot of fun,
because this, this is over.
She violated your orifice with her nasty alien probe?
She did it? She went in there?
All her little embryo alien babies are gestating and hatching inside of you.
They're growing right now, probably.
You need to vomit it right now.
Yak it. Yak it right now.
-Who are you? -Leonardo Ponce De Leon Spitz.
Okay? I'm the key to this.
The aliens, they want me 'cause of my site.
Whoa, guys, right there.
SAM: Run.
Mikaela!
Come on. We gotta move.
MALE STUDENT: It's a bomb!
You've got to get that box.
This way.
WHEELIE: What? Hey. Let me out, let me out.
Oh, my God, you know how to hot-wire a car? That's so hot.
Drive, drive, drive. She's right there. She's right there!
Come on, come on, come on.
Go! Go! Go! Back up the car.
Now.
Tongue.
Oh, my God!
Kiss this, bitch!
SAM: Drive, drive, drive.
Okay, so what else don't I know, all right?
Since you guys forgot to mention some minor details.
That thing you saw back there, that was the little baby...
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Sam!
Sam!
-Sam! -LEO: Hold on!
-SAM: Pull me up. -Hold on!
MIKAELA: Sam, get back in!
LEO: I don't want to die. We're gonna die. Oh, my God!
Jesus! Jesus!
Come here, boy.
Closer.
-Oh, my God. -SAM: Okay.
MEGATRON: You remember me, don't you?
I did what you said, okay? Just don't hurt us.
Shut up!
(SCREAMING) Sam!
MEGATRON: Yeah. Yes, yes.
It feels good to grab your flesh.
I am going to kill you slowly, painfully,
but first, we have some delicate work to do.
MEGATRON: How I could snap your limbs off.
Doctor, examine this alien specimen.
I'll scan you. Let's take a look at your face.
I'm the doctor. The odd job. Information.
Yeah!
Beseeching my shard.
Easy or tough way?
MEGATRON: There they are.
SAM: That's what I'm seeing in my head.
MEGATRON: These symbols can lead us to the Energon source.
DOCTOR: We must have the brain on the table.
-Chop, chop! -Brain?
What does he mean by my brain?
Well, you have something on your mind, something I need.
Hold on. I know you're pissed. I know you're pissed
because I tried to kill you and it's completely understandable.
If somebody tried to kill me, I'd be upset, too.
I think that we have an opportunity here
to start anew and develop our relationship
and see where it leads us, okay?
So, you just call Doctor Inspector off
and let's just talk for five seconds.
Wait, wait, wait!
LEO: Come on! Go, go!
MIKAELA: Sam!
Go, go, go!
OPTIMUS: Sam!
LEO: Run!
Go, go, go, go!
SAM: Here he comes.
OPTIMUS: Hide, Sam.
Weak.
Puny. Waste of metal.
Junkyard crap.
MEGATRON: Decepticons.
Come here, boy.
MEGATRON: There is another source of Energon hidden on this planet.
The boy could lead us to it.
Optimus!
MEGATRON: Is the future of our race
not worth a single human life?
Up. Get up! You'll never stop at one.
You'll never stop at one.
I'll take you all on.
Piece of tin.
Sam! Where are you?
No!
MEGATRON: You're so weak
The last Prime is dead.
Sam, run. Run.
IRONHIDE: Autobots, attack!
Bumblebee, get them out of here.
This is Lennox.
MEGATRON: That went well.
STARSCREAM: We've lost the boy, Master.
The Autobots must be shielding their signals.
I can't even rely on you to swat a simple insect?
One insect among seven billion.
MEGATRON: Shut up.
He could be anywhere.
Then we will force them to find him for us.
It's time for the world to know of our presence.
No more disguises. No mercy.
The time has come for my master's arrival.
Decepticons, mobilize. It is time.
JUDY: Speaking French is so exciting.
Oh, God, who is this?
Hello? I mean, bonsoir!
What? Who is this?
SOUNDWAVE: Where is the boy?
For Pete's sakes. I'm not impressed
with your perverted mouth-breathing.
Jeez!
You are invading my space. I'm gonna have to drop you.
Would you get out of here?
RON: I didn't come all the way across the ocean to eat a plate of snails.
RON: I didn't come all the way across the ocean to eat a plate of snails. I want to try new things.
Looks like Canadian goose poop.
It's nasty.
Revenge is mine.
Yeah!
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: ...definitely not a plane...
MORSHOWER: Look, carriers don't just sink.
...a horrible accident or a terrorist attack or worse...
Negative. NORAD confirmed,
projectile came from beyond our atmosphere,
inbound at 30,000 knots.
(STATIC HISSING) Citizens of the human hive,
your leaders have withheld the truth.
You are not alone in this universe.
We have lived among you, hidden,
but no more.
As you've seen, we can destroy your cities at will,
unless you turn over this boy.
If you resist us, we will destroy the world as you know it.
MALE ANNOUNCER 1: What we're hearing from the German government
is that the world broadcast was a satellite hacking.
MALE ANNOUNCER 2: The military
has just told us they have assumed Condition Delta,
which is the highest level we have been at since 9/11.
President Obama is being flown to a bunker
somewhere in the middle of the United States
in the face of the worst simultaneous
attacks ever around the globe.
The aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt
goes down off the East Coast, all hands lost.
Worldwide casualties are in the neighborhood of 7,000,
but that number could climb.
It's still too early to tell.
What we need to ask now is, "Who and why?"
MALE ANNOUNCER 3: The FBI is still trying to locate the boy, Sam Witwicky.
We believe they have information about the attacks.
The FBI, CIA and Interpol
are all seeking the cooperation of worldwide law enforcement.
LEO: You need to listen to this, man. You gotta check this out.
MALE ANNOUNCER 4: They have a traffic-camera spotting...
They have a picture of me, man. We're dead, bro.
FBI, CIA, we are wanted fugitives now.
I just need you to focus for one minute, man.
-Just stop. -This thing has blown up
to a whole other level, all right?
Give me this thing. They can track us.
-Do you see this? -What?
They can track us? Like, satellite track us?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Okay, I'm not even with you guys!
Technically, I'm like a hostage. This is kidnapping...
-Enough is... -MUDFLAP: Yo, Leo!
This thing's gonna give me a heart attack, I swear.
That's 'cause you is a wuss.
You guys forced me into that car, right?
I think he's scared.
Hey, Mudflap, what are we gonna do with this shrimp taco?
Let's pop a cap in his ass, throw him in the trunk
and then nobody gonna know nothing, know what I mean?
-Not in my trunk. -Bumper cars? I'm hearing you.
Okay? I'm right here and I can hear you.
No one's popping any caps in any asses, okay?
I've had a hell of a day. Why don't you get a haircut with your bitch ass?
Why don't you get a haircut with your bitch ass?
Go whine to your boyfriend.
Listen, Sam, I know what I'm gonna do, man.
Go to the authorities and tell them the truth.
I had nothing to do with this.
Hey, you wanted this, right?
You wanted the real deal? That's what this is.
Wake up. You're in the middle of it!
You want to run? Go ahead! No one's stopping you.
Stop complaining.
RATCHET: What is the meaning of this?
You dare point a gun at me?
You want a piece of me? I will tear you apart!
Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons!
-Tell them to lower their weapons. -Tell them first.
Tell them to lower their weapons.
Major, there's nothing I can do. Talk to him.
Your NEST team is deactivated, Major.
You are to cease anti-Decepticon operations
and return to Diego Garcia pending further orders.
No, we take our orders directly from Chairman Morshower, sir.
Well, I'll see your Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
and I will raise you a President of the United States.
I have operational command now.
An alien blood feud has been brought to our shores
for which our soldiers are paying the price.
The secret is out.
This is our war now and we will win it as we always have,
with a coordinated military strategy.
This fool is terribly misinformed.
You're gonna need every asset that you've got.
What we need is to draw up battle plans
while we explore every possible diplomatic solution.
Like what, handing over the kid?
All options are being considered.
Whatever the Decepticons are after, this is just the start.
There is no negotiating with them.
I'm ordering you to stand down.
You won't be needing this anymore.
Get your assets back to base.
And take that pile of scrap metal back to Diego Garcia.
Let's go.
I really don't like that dude. He's an asshole.
MAN ON PA: Autobots, report to hangar for transport.
Ironhide, we should leave this planet.
That's not what Optimus would want.
There's nothing that you could have done.
-You okay? -Yeah.
Bee, if you hate me, I understand. (WHINES)
I messed up. I'm sorry.
Young fella, you are the person I care about most in my life.
If there's anything you need, I won't be far away.
He's dead because of me.
He came here to protect me and he's dead.
There's some things you just can't change.
So, his sacrifice for us would not have been in vain. Hallelujah!
I'm gonna make it right. I'm going to turn myself in.
We... We've got to stick together.
You're not going to do that.
Yes, I am.
BUMBLEBEE: Everything we worked for will be wiped out in one day
-You two... -BOTH: Huh?
Hey, you know the glyphs?
These? The symbols that have been rattling around in my head?
That's old school, yo. That's, like... That's Cybertronian.
That's some serious stuff, right there.
They gotta mean something, like a message or like a map.
Like a map to an Energon source.
Can you read this?
Read? No. We don't really do much reading. Not so much.
If you can't read it, we gotta find somebody who can.
Look who came sashaying back.
Hair growing like a Chia Pet. Look at him.
I had a bit of a mild panic attack earlier, right?
That's 'cause you're a pussy.
I think I'm allowed that, considering what I've been through.
I heard you have a problem.
I think I know someone who can help.
-Who? -Robo-Warrior.
LEO: This guy, Robo-Warrior,
everything about anything alien, he's supposed to know.
One time we revenge-hacked his site
and maybe I saw some of your alien drawings or whatever.
This is it. Yep. -Deli. -Good front
-Deli. -Good front
All right, wait here. I'll give you the go/no go. All right?
Number 42, we got your kishka, knish, kasha-varnishka and kreplach combo right here.
kasha-varnishka and kreplach combo right here.
Cash only. Who's next?
I told you to cure the lox in the brine and then smoke it.
Ma, you want me to cut my hand off, or what? You... You ruined a beautiful piece of fish, you retard!
You... You ruined a beautiful piece of fish, you retard!
I'm like a ninja with a blade. It's an art form.
Give me your money. Get out of here.
Hey, Sal. Watch your reach, huh?
Take a number, young man.
Robo-Warrior.
Know him?
I never heard of him.
You never heard of TheRealEffingDeal.com?
You must be talking about that amateur-hour blog operation
You must be talking about that amateur-hour blog operation with Game Boy-level security.
Robo-Warrior.
It's him. It's him. That's the guy right there. That's him.
No.
You got to be kidding me.
All right, meat store's closed. Everybody out. Out, right now.
WOMAN: When he says to go, you go.
That means you, lady, right now.
Wait a minute. You know this guy?
-We're old friends. -Old friends?
You're the case that shut down Sector Seven,
got the kibosh, disbanded.
No more security clearance, no retirement, no nothing. All 'cause of you and your little criminal girlfriend.
All 'cause of you and your little criminal girlfriend.
Look at her now, so mature.
Moron. Where's the whitefish?
Hey! Don't touch me with the pig.
-SIMMONS: Yakov. -What?
You don't get Christmas bonuses standing around.
You want those new teeth you saw on SkyMall?
It's my dream. Help her out.
-You live with your mama? -No, my mama lives with me. It's a big difference. They got your face all over the news,alien boy.
It's a big difference. They got your face all over the news,alien boy.
-Yeah, I know. -And NBE One's still kicking?
How did that happen? Don't answer.
I don't know what you're hiding,
but I don't want anything to do with it.
So, good-bye. You never saw me. I got bagels to schmear. Vanish.
Can you give me five seconds? Look, hold on, I need your help.
Really? You need my help?
I need... Look, I am slowly losing my mind.
I need... Look, I am slowly losing my mind. Okay, I had a little crab-bot,
plunged a device deep into the soft tissues of my brain
and started projecting little alien
symbols like a freaking home movie.
And on top of that, I'm a wanted fugitive.
So, you think you got it rough?
You said it projected images off your brain?
Right.
Meat locker, now.
LEO: Dead pigs. MIKAELA: Yuck.
What you're about to see is top secret.
Do not tell my mother.
LEO: Swine flu. Not good. SIMMONS: Now you know.
Next time you eat a goat or a pig, there's a story behind it.
Next time you eat a goat or a pig, there's a story behind it. Sad little story.
TV: An entire city flat. How do you explain that?
Are you saying you believe in aliens?
SIMMONS: Okay, files, files.
We're talking about symbols.
Hey, still radioactive. Hands off.
Okay, Cube-brain.
Any of these look like the symbols you saw?
Any of these look like the symbols you saw? Where'd you get these?
Before I got fired, I poached S-7's crown jewel,
Before I got fired, I poached S-7's crown jewel, over 75 years of alien research,
which points to one inescapable fact.
The Transformers, they've been here a long, long time.
How do I know?
Archeologists found these unexplained markings
in ancient ruins all over the world.
China. Egypt. Greece.
Shot in 1932.
These the symbols you're seeing in your head?
Yeah.
Same ones over here, right?
So, tell me, how did they end up all drawing the same things?
Aliens. And I think some of them stayed.
Check this out. Project Black Knife.
Robots in disguise, hiding here all along.
Robots in disguise, hiding here all along. We detected radioactive signatures all across the country.
I pleaded on my knees with S-7 to investigate it,
but they said the readings were infinitesimal,
that I was obsessed.
Me. Can you imagine that?
Yeah. Megatron said that
there was another Energon source here.
-On Earth. Another source? -On Earth.
Okay? And that these symbols, maps in my head, would lead him there.
You talk to your Autobot friends about this?
No, no, no, the source is before them.
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them. It's before them.
-So, it comes before them. -Correct.
Well, then we're porked, unless we can talk to a Decepticon.
I mean, I'm not on speaking terms with them.
Actually, I am.
WHEELIE: Let me out.
This is going to be a little bit sad. Open it.
I will have so many Decepticons on your butt.
Hey, behave.
-What is it, a Decepticon? -Yeah.
-And you're training him? -I'm trying to.
I spent my whole adult life combing the planet for aliens,
and you're carrying around one
in your purse like a little Chihuahua.
Do you want a throwdown, you pubic 'fro-head?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry about your eye, you know,
but, if you're a good boy, then I'm not gonna torch your other eye.
Okay? I'm not gonna torch it.
Just tell me what these symbols are, please.
All right. I know that. That's the language of the Primes.
I don't read it, but these guys...
Where the frick did you find photos of these guys?
-Is this they? -Yeah. Seekers, pal.
Oldest of the old.
They've been here thousands of years,
looking for something. I don't know what.
Nobody tells me nothing, but they'll translate those symbols for you.
And I know where to find them.
-Show us. -Yeah.
SIMMONS: The closest one's in Washington.
Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. Land of dreams in there.
All I ever wanted to be was an astronaut.
-SIMMONS: Hold those. -What is that?
What? I wear them when I'm in a funk.
So does Giambi, Jeter. It's a baseball thing. Okay.
Watches synchronized, sharp mind and empty bladder.
You get caught, demand an attorney and don't ever say my name.
Take one of these pills. Slip it under your tongue.
It's the high-concentrate polymer they put in Oreo cookies.
Tricks the polygraph every time.
Okay. Now, let's get this show on the road.
(BUZZING) Whoa. Whoa!
No, listen, I can't do this.
I'm not some alien bounty hunter, guys.
I'm not gonna do this. Guards have guns. I don't want to die.
Kid, kid, kid.
You compromise this mission, you are dead to me.
Now look into my eyes and tighten up that sphincter.
GUARD ON PA: The museum is now closing.
Yo, baba! Bad news, bro. Ran out of toilet paper.
You got any out here? Please tell me you do.
Sir. I suggest you get in there. The museum is closed.
Listen, man, I understand that,
but as you can see, this is important.
All right? Thumper dumper. I got to go. All right.
GUARD: Sir, you are a grown, naked man around children.
Pull your pants up and exit the building.
LEO: I'm not going anywhere.
You got that paper, right, sir?
GUARD: You should be embarrassed.
This is a family museum, sir.
What is going on here?
How many times can you get tased
in the nuts before you can't have kids?
You are an amateur, man, a rank amateur.
We just downed five guards. Five guards.
-Get your stuff and get out of here. -Give me a second here.
I got to get the tracker, all right.
Be good.
WHEELIE: I'm claustrophobic.
Look, look. Follow him. Follow him. He knows where he's going.
-He knows something. -What?
He knows something.
(DEVICE BEEPING RAPIDLY) -You got what I got? -Yeah.
SIMMONS: Blackbird.
There he is.
This guy's a legend, like the Chairman of the Board!
Yo, freshman, point the shard and watch the magic happen.
Shit. It's a Decepticon!
-Decepticon? -Decepticon?
Behind the MiG now!
JETFIRE: What sort of hideous mausoleum is this?
Answer me, pawns and knaves.
Show yourselves or suffer my infinite wrath.
You little spinal-cord-based organisms!
Bugger it.
Behold the eternal glory of Jetfire.
Prepare for remote systems override
Prepare for remote systems override I tell you, this guy did not age well.
I don't think he's gonna hurt us.
I command these doors to open.
Fire! I said, fire!
Bollocks.
Damn these worthless parts.
Wait a second.
Itchy, wretched rust in my arse.
The museum is going to be very angry. Very angry.
We gotta catch that plane.
Right. I'm on a mission.
HUMANS: Wait, wait, wait, wait.
-What do you want? -Look, we just want to talk.
I have no time to talk. I'm on a mission.
I'm a mercenary doom-bringer. What planet am I on?
-Earth. -Earth?
Terrible name for a planet. Might as well call it "Dirt."
Planet "Dirt."
Tell me, is that robot civil war still going on?
-Who's winning? -The Decepticons.
(GROANS) Well, I changed sides to the Autobots.
Well, I changed sides to the Autobots. What do you mean, changed sides?
JETFIRE: It's a choice.
It's an intensely personal decision.
So much negativity. Who wants to live a life filled with hate?
You mean you don't have to work
for those miserable, freaking Decepticons?
If Decepticons had their way,
they'd destroy the whole universe.
I'm changing sides. I'm changing sides, too, warrior goddess.
-Who's your little Autobot? -You're cute.
Name's Wheelie. Yeah. Say my name, say my name.
What are you allowing to happen to your foot just now?
At least he's faithful, Sam.
Yeah, well, he's faithful and he's nude
and he's perverted.
Can you just... Can you stop? -Hey, what are you doing? -It's just something
to think about. I won't argue with... What were you saying?
I told you my name was Jetfire, so stop judging me.
Somebody shit the bed this morning.
JETFIRE: I have issues of my own.
And it started with my mother.
My ancestors have been here for centuries.
My father, he was a wheel, the first wheel.
Do you know what he transformed into?
-No. -Nothing.
But he did so with honor, dignity, damn it.
Bollocks. (MUTTERING) My boosters are fried.
I think we can help each other.
You know things I don't know.
I know things you don't know, I do.
I don't think he knows anything. Honestly, I don't.
I could do this all day. It comes in waves, these vivid symbols.
They're symbols, but they're in my mind.
You see, all this is in my mind
and Megatron wants what's in my mind.
Him and someone called the Fallen.
The Fallen? I know him.
He left me here to rust. The original Decepticon.
He's terrible to work for. It's always apocalypse, chaos, crisis.
These transcriptions, they were part of my mission,
the Fallen's search.
I remember now, for the Dagger's Tip, and the key.
Slow down. The Dagger's Tip? The key? What are you talking about?
No time to explain. Hold on, everybody. Stay still or you'll die.
Well, that wasn't so bad.
I just hope we're still on the right planet.
WHEELIE: Hey, that freaking hurt.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God, what a beautiful face.
This would be a perfect moment,
except you landed on my testicles.
Please, get off.
(GRUNTS) God, my balls.
MIKAELA: Sam!
Where are we? Simmons!
Hey! Yeah!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What is this? It's Vegas.
-SAM: You guys okay? -MIKAELA: Yeah.
LEO: Hey, I think we're in Vegas.
That really, really hurt. You're just lucky that I didn't get hurt!
People could have gotten killed, okay?
And if I would have gotten hurt,
-you would have heard... -Shut up.
I told you I was opening a space bridge.
It's the fastest way to travel to Egypt.
When did you... When did you tell us? You didn't tell us anything.
You didn't tell us anything. Why are we in Egypt?
Don't you get snippy with me, fleshling. You were duly informed.
Can you just stop for a second? Can you focus?
Can you tell us why we're in Egypt
so we can all have a little bit of semblance of peace of mind?
JETFIRE: This planet was visited by our race once before,
by our earliest ancestors, millennia ago.
They were on an exploratory mission to harvest Energon,
the lifeblood of our race.
Without it, we'll all perish, oxidize
and rust, like my wretched self.
and rust, like my wretched self. Do you have any idea what it's like to slowly fall apart and die?
Do you have any idea what it's like to slowly fall apart and die? Let's not get episodic, okay, old-timer?
Beginning, middle, end. Facts. Details. Condense. Plot. Tell it.
Somewhere buried in this desert,
our ancestors built a great machine.
It harvests Energon by destroying suns.
It harvests Energon by destroying suns. -Destroy suns? -You mean blow them up?
Yes. You see, in the beginning,
there were seven Primes, our original leaders.
And they set out into the universe,
seeking distant suns to harvest.
The Primes set out with one rule,
never destroy a planet with life,
until one of them tried to defy this rule.
And his name forevermore was the Fallen.
He despised the human race
and he wanted to kill you all by turning on that machine.
The only way to activate it is with a legendary key
called the Matrix of Leadership.
A great battle took place over possession of the Matrix.
The Fallen was stronger than his brothers,
so they had no choice but to steal and hide it from him.
In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away
in a tomb made of their very own bodies,
a tomb we cannot find.
Somewhere, buried in this desert, that deadly machine remains.
The Fallen knows where it is
and if he finds the tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.
Okay, so how do we stop him?
Only a Prime can defeat the Fallen.
Optimus Prime?
So, you've met a Prime?
Why, you must have met a great descendant.
Is he alive, here on this planet?
He sacrificed himself to save me.
So, he's dead.
Without a Prime, it's impossible.
No one else could stop the Fallen.
So, the same energy that's gonna be used to reactivate the machine
could that energy somehow be used to reactivate Optimus
and bring him back to life?
It was never designed for that purpose, but it's an energy like no other.
but it's an energy like no other.
So, then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?
Follow your mind, your map, your symbols.
What you carved in the sand, it's your clue.
When dawn alights the Dagger's Tip,
Three Kings will reveal the doorway.
Find the doorway.
Go now! Go!
That was my mission. It's your mission now.
Go before the Decepticons find me and find you.
Okay, here's what my CIA contact says.
Ancient Sumerians used to call the Gulf of Aqaba the "Dagger's Tip."
-That's the Dagger's Tip. -It's part of the Red Sea.
It divides Egypt and Jordan like the tip of a blade.
29.5 degrees north, 35 east. Here it is.
First thing we've got to do is get Optimus to the Dagger's Tip.
How are you gonna get him halfway around the world?
I'm gonna make a call.
We got cops.
I can't go to prison, guys.
SIMMONS: Sam, we got to get off this road and lay low.
Man, stupid cops.
This is what's called blending in like a ninja.
Shut up or I'll blend my fist in your face.
They're gone.
Okay, we're running out of time.
I gotta make the call to Lennox...
You're on the Worldwide Wanted List.
Try calling one base, they'll track you here in seconds.
CIA is all over this place!
You're gonna call.
Okay. That's a good idea.
All right.
I mean, I just had my mind on other things,
like winding up in an Egyptian prison.
MAN ON PA: NEST departure, 2100 hours.
So, we're shipping him back to base. This is such a mistake.
SOLDIER: Major Lennox, phone call.
Lennox, I'm with the kid. The kid. You
Lennox, I'm with the kid. The kid. You know, the one with the attitude, right?
We need the truck. The truck.
We got a possible resurrection going on over here.
You're not gonna believe where we are.
Code Tut, as in King Tutankhamen.
Back of a $1 bill.
Coordinates for airdrop, 29.5 north,
34.88 east. Write it down. Write it.
Oh, my God. I got to go. Okay. Heat comes.
Wait, who are you?
Wait. It's me. Leo. Me. Leo. Leo. Leo.
Cops are coming right now. We need to go.
Move, move, move, move.
Coordinates, 29.5 north, 34.88 east.
Tip of the Red Sea. Gulf of Aqaba.
-Egypt? -Are you serious?
Sir.
Even if we could figure out a way to get big man over there,
how is this little kid supposed to bring him back to life?
Look, I don't know, but we got to trust him.
SAM: Okay, let's go over it again.
BOTH: When the dawn alights the Dagger's Tip,
-the Three Kings...- Will reveal the doorway.
That's what he said. You know what it means?
-No, what does it mean? -SIMMONS: I have no idea.
LEO: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Checkpoint. Checkpoint.
I don't have my passport.
GUARD: Passport!
They got cameras at the top.
(SPEAKING ARABIC) All right, chill. This is espionage now. I can handle it.
These are my people. I'm one-thirty-sixth Arab.
WHEELIE: Great, a fricking Munchkin.
Little people are mean. Tell him he's tall.
The Dagger's Tip? Right?
Egypt, Jordan. We want to go there.
Me and my family. This is my family. This is my son,
my other son, my daughter. We're tourists, from New York.
-New York? -Yes. Yes.
Fifty kilometers.
You look like the guy that runs my falafel stand.
Thank you very much.
I- know. I know you from somewhere. -Go, Yankees!
Put it on the wire to the CIA.
SOUNDWAVE: Decepticons, boy's location detected.
STARSCREAM IN PURSUIT
(SHUSHING) SKIDS: Undercover, yo. You got to blend in with your surroundings.
You know, you got to be part of the landscape. (GROANS)
Awesome! I think aliens built that.
Yeah, yeah.
Come on. Move it! Move it!
Guard us. Low profile. Don't make a scene, okay?
WHEELIE: Yeah, some of us got work to do. Dumb Autobots.
NEST TEAM E.T.A. - 6 HRS
SAM: Being my girlfriend is hazardous to your health.
Yeah, well, girls like dangerous boys.
-Do they? -Yeah.
You might as well just say it.
Ladies first.
Okay, so tonight you're going to be a gentleman.
You're really chivalrous.
Why are you mad at me?
You know what? Baby, I'm not... I'm not mad.
Do you realize that I just flew 3,000 miles
to keep you from getting killed?
I know.
Who else could be your girlfriend, Sam?
Look at the things I go through with you.
And now we're underneath the moon and the stars
and the three most beautiful pyramids on the planet
and you still can't even tell me that you love me.
Pyramids.
-What? -Why do boys always change the subject?
Pyramids and stars.
-Sam? -Come with me really quick.
Simmons. Leo. Wake up.
Listen, astronomy class, page 47. Remember the class?
No. I was only in college for two days. Remember that?
-Here. Get up. Up, up. -What is he talking about?
Okay, you see those three stars?
You see how the last one touches the horizon?
That's Orion's belt, but it's also called the Three Kings.
And the reason for that is the three Egyptian kings
who built the pyramids of Giza built them to mirror those stars,
built them to mirror those stars, so it's like an arrow staring us straight in the face.
so it's like an arrow staring us straight in the face.
They all point due east, towards Jordan.
The mountains of Petra.
PILOT ON PA: We've had an engine malfunction.
We're gonna have to divert to SOCCENT.
Flight master, let's lighten the load and prepare for bailout.
Bailout? Bailout? Bailout? Bailout?
All right, team, grab your chutes!
Bailout like bailout?
You familiar with the standard MC-4?
Of course not.
I've never jumped out of a perfectly good airplane before
-Wait, this really happening? -Yeah.
All right, here we go.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You're behind this, aren't you?
What are you talking about? You heard the pilot.
These guys don't mess around. This is just standard procedure.
I'm just following orders to the letter. Isn't that what you said?
(WHIMPERING) You just signed a death warrant on your career, Major.
What was that? What was that?
That's not good. Come on.
-Right this way. -I can't jump out of an airplane.
I have an ulcer. No, no.
Come on. It's okay.
I really can't do this. What are you doing...
Come here! Come here.
Why aren't you wearing your chute?
Because I have to secure the VIPs first.
Okay, I want you to listen very carefully
and memorize everything that I say.
Each chute has a GPS tracker so you can be found by Search and Rescue.
Right next to that's a fabric webbing called a bridle,
which holds the pin that keeps the main container closed.
Okay, are you listening?
-I can't hear what... -Stop that.
All right. All right. When the pilot chute inflates into the air,
When the pilot chute inflates into the air,
it pulls the pin and opens the main.
Red's your backup, blue's your primary.
I want you to pull the blue. I need you to pull it really hard. Not now, we're on the plane, you dumb-ass.
Not now, we're on the plane, you dumb-ass.
He say good-bye?
No, he didn't even say good-bye.
General, we're loaded and ready.
You give us the go, and we'll be ready to press in five minutes. -Excellent. -Sir, you need to see this now.
-Excellent. -Sir, you need to see this now.
-Have we checked these coordinates? -Egypt, sir.
-They're airdropping in. -You've got to be kidding me.
He knows something.
We need to be ready to back him up if this thing goes hot.
Copy that.
CIA just got a hit on the boy,
100 miles from the location on that little note there.
It's getting hotter.
It's gotta be around here somewhere.
SIMMONS: You see the size of this? You see this?
SKIDS: Spectacular.
Amazing. Look at that.
SAM: It's here somewhere, guys.
Yeah, why? 'Cause we're trusting Grandpa Blackbird
'Cause we're trusting Grandpa Blackbird who doesn't even know what planet he's on?
who doesn't even know what planet he's on?
In his defense, this is the biggest
doorway I've ever seen in my entire life.
Okay. Well, that's great. Let me do a quick search, all right?
Nope. Ever cross your mind, guys,
that archeologists have been here before?
There's nothing here.
SIMMONS: Real life is heartbreak, despair, kid.
Sometimes you get to the end of the rainbow and the leprechauns went and booby-trapped it!
and the leprechauns went and booby-trapped it!
LEO: I'm listening to you? You live with your mother!
It's not over.
LEO: It is over. It's done.
Why are we still listening to you, little punk-ass?
I mean, what you ever done for us except ding my rim?
Killed Megatron. How about that?
Well, he didn't get the job done,
you know what I mean, 'cause he's back now...
Are you scared?
Scared? Scared of your ugly face. I'm ugly? Well, we're twins, you stupid genius.
I'm ugly? Well, we're twins, you stupid genius.
Bring it, then. Get off me.
I'll change your face around.
I'll get all up in that ass! Bring it!
SAM: Guys! Whoa! Hey!
-You like the way that feels? -That didn't hurt.
You like that, don't you?
Come on, Bumblebee!
Bumblebee, listen.
Now, that's rude.
SAM: Oh, my God. The symbols.
Bee! Shoot it.
SIMMONS: Check this out. SAM: Look at it.
SIMMONS: Wow! SAM: These are the bodies Jetfire was talking about.
SIMMONS: The tomb of the Primes.
Yo!
Yo!
The Matrix.
SAM: No.
No.
SIMMONS: Thousands of years, turned to dust.
This isn't how it's supposed to end.
Hear that?
US Air Force! C-17s!
SAM: What's a C-17?
You can't bring him back, Sam.
There's nothing left.
Look! Look around you.
We didn't just go through everything
we went through for no reason at all,
to just have it end like this.
There is a reason that we are here.
The voices and the symbols in my head led us here for a purpose.
Everyone's after me because of what I know,
and what I know is that this is going to work.
How do you know it's gonna work?
Because I believe it.
You best let me out of this plane.
Dropping the big boy. Sam!
You think you can bring him back to life with that pixie dust?
Absolutely. Let's go.
Go!
Let's move it. Remember, they're friendlies.
Cover Optimus!
Secure the village. Get those cases down here.
I need snipers and Stingers up high.
So, we just dropped off 10 tons of
dead robot in the middle of nowhere.
I hope this little kid know what he's doing.
Yeah, me too.
Got a visual! Yellow team! Four clicks!
Pop flare!
That's them, right there. See the flare?
Right over there! See it?
Sam!
Oh, God. Please, God! Please.
Leo, stop freaking out. Stop freaking out.
Shut this guy up, huh?
Please, just let me live, just let me live!
MIKAELA: Shut up and let him drive!
Just stop screaming... All right, that's it!
(SCREAMING) I can't take that guy anymore.
SIMMONS: Hide in the dust. Use the dust.
We've got to split up. Bumblebee, you're the decoy.
You lead the Decepticons away, all right?
-I'm gonna get Optimus. -I'll help draw their fire
-with Huey and Dewey there. -You get to those soldiers.
I hope that dust works, kid.
Thank you.
LEO: He's turning around. He's coming back. He's coming back.
It's up to me.
One man, alone, betrayed by the country he loves,
now its last hope in their final hour of need.
Prepare to be driven like never before, by the maestro.
Hey, hey. Don't go nowhere. Drive.
You'll never make it, kid.
I'm coming with you.
Bravery will only get you so far. You tased me, okay? You owe me. I'm going.
Okay, okay. That was a test. You passed. All right?
That thing's got alien tattoos all over it. That ain't Air Force.
(ELECTRONIC WHIZZING) What the hell was that?
-Anyone copy? -Anyone there? Who's up?
-Copy? -SOLDIER: Radio's down.
It's dead. Comms are down.
EMP burst.
I see how this day is going in this godforsaken desert.
Yes, sir?
GALLOWAY: Major Lennox told me to pull the cord.
I know, sir.
Well, what country am I in right now?
United States.
No, not the United States. I'm from the United States.
I'm in the middle of nowhere surrounded by donkeys.
Well, that was our good friend, Galloway.
He's less than pleased.
How is it that we can't reach our men,
but he can reach me, from some random Egyptian desert?
Nothing.
Right, go burn an SOS.
Let the eye in the sky know we need some help.
Yes, sir.
LENNOX: Pop some more flares so the kid can find us.
Look. There it is. We got a couple of miles.
Lennox's team has the latest in quantum crypto gear.
Can somebody tell me why we can't establish simple radio contact?
We're hailing them on every frequency and mode in the book, sir.
Our satellites in the area have gone blind. We're working it, sir.
Damn it. Something's not right. It doesn't add up.
Contact the Jordanians, see what air assets they've got in the area,
and get Egypt's General Salam.
Ask him to clear some USV overflights in Egyptian airspace.
We need an assist in confirming visuals now.
SOLDIER 1: Scramble Predators now.
SOLDIER 2: V-1, rotate.
SAM: We still have a mile that way.
Come on.
This way. This way.
One man, alone...
Stop saying that. ...betrayed by the country he loves!
Oh, my goodness. I'm in the car, okay? You're not alone.
SIMMONS: Just relax. You're with the maestro.
I don't think he's still following us.
That's what you think.
Uh-oh.
Master, sorry to be the bearer of bad news,
but the soldiers brought the body of Prime.
The boy must have the Matrix.
We cannot let him reach Optimus.
Decepticons, begin our assault!
SOLDIER: We've got incoming!
LENNOX: We got a whole lot of fight coming our way.
-How many? -About 13 of them.
This ain't good. This ain't good.
We're about to get our asses whupped.
SOLDIER: Bravo-Charlie, kneel.
All right, those Decepticons are searching for Sam.
Whatever he has, he thinks it'll bring Optimus back to life,
so our mission is to find him and get him to Optimus.
All right, we're gonna draw fire from the left flank.
All right, we're gonna draw fire from the left flank. -I need a scout team. -IRONHIDE: I'm leading.
Go up through the middle with Arcee and Ironhide.
All right, when you see the precious cargo,
I want you to pop green smoke
and come back through those pillars.
We'll have the ambush set.
All right. Let's go. Move out! SOLDIERS: Hoo-ah!
You ever see that film Gunfight at the O.K. Corral?
With Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas?
No, why?
Looks like we're right in the middle of it.
Is that good?
A lot of people died.
Oh!
(WHIMPERING) Hide.
-Vamonos, amigos. -Oh, my God!
-Hit the deck! -Oh, my God!
(WHISPERING) Sam, Sam.
I don't think they saw us.
Get down. Get down. Get down.
Okay. Listen.
Once it's clear, we run for Optimus as fast as we can, okay?
What if it doesn't work?
It's gonna work.
What if it doesn't?
It's gonna work. It'll work.
Up, up, up!
Get ready to jump.
SAM: We got a half-mile. I don't think the soldiers know we're here.
Fall back.
Ironhide, up the middle.
Ironhide, move it.
Let's go! Go, go.
MEGATRON: Devastator!
We're trapped! There's nowhere to go. We're gonna die.
If we're going out, we're going out like men, understand?
Look at this mother...
Mean robots suck!
-Hang on! -Hang on, okay?
Simmons! Don't let go!
Hang in there, I got you! Just hang in.
I don't want to die!
Kung fu grip, boy. Kung fu grip!
You ain't getting me.
He dead. He got so ate.
Who's your daddy now, huh?
He got all ate up.
The only safe place is right under it.
Run at it. Run for its feet! Move it!
Run at it. Run for its feet! Move it! Yeah.
You should've never eaten me. I'm gonna bust your face up.
Oh, my God!
Nobody mess with me. In your face.
Keep fighting, Mudflap.
Oh, my God!
Nobody messes with the twins.
-I got you... -My bad!
Aw, man! You shot me in the face
-Stay under it. -Yeah, stay under it.
Come on.
Judy!
-Sam! Sam! -What?
Sam! Sam!
JUDY: Sam! -Sam! -Dad!
Wait, wait!
Please listen to me! I want you to run! Run!
Please listen to me! I want you to run! Run! Dad, just stop! They don't want you, they want me!
-RON: Oh, God! -Wait!
DEVASTATOR: Sam Witwicky.
Don't hurt them. This is what you want. You don't want them.
-Go! Go! -Please, stop!
-Stop. -JUDY: Listen to your father!
(WHISTLING) RON: Just get out of here!
Just don't hurt them. I know what you want.
RON: Just go! Just go!
And I know that you need me because I know about the Matrix.
-RON: Don't do it, Sam... -Please, Dad.
They're going to kill us all anyway.
SAM: Here's what you want, right here.
Bumblebee!
Kill him, Bee. Kill him.
Stay tight, Ma. Come on. Get in here.
-Bee? -Yeah.
-Hey! -I don't know
what's going on, but we've got to move!
RON: There's got to be a way out of here!
Judy, get back, get back, get back.
Against the wall! Against the wall!
Against the wall. Against the wall.
Bee! Bumblebee!
You get them somewhere safe, all right?
You've got to get in the car and get to safety.
You've got to get in the car and get to safety. No, this isn't up for discussion!
No, this isn't up for discussion! -You're my son! -You're my son! -I know.
-Dad... -We all go together!
-Listen... -We're all going together!
Dad, stop, okay? Get in the car.
He's gonna get you to safety.
You know, you run. You don't stop,
you don't hide, you run. You hear what I'm saying, okay?
I'll find you when you're safe.
-No. -You've got to let me go, Dad.
You have to let me go. You have to. Ron.
Ron. Ron, let him go.
You come back! Come on.
JUDY: Ron! Mikaela! Mikaela!
-Go with my parents. -I'm not gonna go without you.
SOLDIER: Move to cover!
We got Jordanians!
We got help!
Down!
You okay, soldier?
We're gonna help you, soldier.
Let's get these wounded clear of the bird.
LEO: Stay still. Stay still. Don't move.
You all right, young man? You have a radio?
Hey, kid, it's been nice knowing you.
Remember what I did for my country.
This is my moment.
You're crazy!
ETA to station, two minutes.
-Put it on the main screen. -Sir. Yes, sir.
Predator 01.
Shit, it's a trick.
Commence Operation Firestorm. Send everyone.
Get those Marines on the ground.
Roll in strike packages...
Task Force Ripper, execute Lightning.
ARCEE: Spotted Sam!
IRONHIDE: Sam!
Ironhide!
Follow us to the pillars. We'll take you to Optimus.
IRONHIDE: Get out, Sam! Get to the pillars.
Let's go.
Oh, God. This is it. The pyramid's built right over the machine.
If they turn that machine on, no more sun.
Not on my watch.
Not on my watch.
CAPTAIN: USS Stennis. Identify.
SIMMONS: Where the hell are you? Watching the Weather Channel?
SportsCenter? I Dream of Jeannie or something?
We got 300 satellites up there.
Where the hell are all our men?
Identify yourself.
What is your name, sailor?
Wilder, Captain of the USS John C. Stennis
aircraft carrier.
Okay, Captain Wilder.
This is Agent Seymour Simmons of Sector Seven.
There is the mother of all non-biologicals
getting ready to blow up our sun.
Do you want to have a throwdown about my lack of clearance
or do you want to help save a gazillion lives?
All right, Agent Simmons. I'm listening.
Five clicks west of the Gulf,
we got ourselves an alien remodeling a pyramid.
Our one hope is a prototype weapon called a rail gun,
shoots a steel projectile at Mach 7.
That's classified.
Don't talk to me about classified, all right?
Now, if you've got a battleship in the Gulf, which I know you do,
you tell them to ready that weapon!
Contact destroyer USS KIDD.
GRAHAM: Alpha Team, flank left!
This way! Move it!
-Where do you need us, sir? -Protect those in line of fire.
Let's go! Go!
Give me your Comms. Come on. Epps!
Right now, we need air support, ASAP!
Have troops in contact 20 miles northwest. Radar contact.
Proceed to 88 Alpha Sierra...
B-1, snap 090.
You are approved to drop your 2,000-pound JDAMs.
-What you got? -I couldn't get to them, sir.
They're 600 meters away and heading right for the pillars.
All right. Precious cargo's coming!
SAM: Move!
Curse you!
IRONHIDE: Sam! Spotted Sam!
-Come on! -2-2 covering fire.
Two civilians, 12 o'clock!
Cover for us!
Hold the air strike! We're rescuing civilians!
Keep firing!
Come on! Mikaela!
Come on! Get in here!
Look who showed up.
You better have a good reason for us to be here.
-Where's Optimus? -He's right over there,
across the courtyard.
I got to get to him right now.
Not with an air strike coming.
I have to get to him right now.
Whoa.
Go. Back, back, back, back.
-Go. -DECEPTICON: Listen up...
Okay.
Incoming!
Stick the landing.
Behold the glory of Jetfire!
Now let me show you how we brought the pain in my day!
I'm too old for this crap.
Keep going, man, 15 rounds of fighting.
I am directly below the enemy's scrotum.
25.7 meters above sea level, 29.32 north.
Kill track, 5205...
Target acquired. Killing track.
MAN ON PA: Two, one... Fire!
Yeah! Yeah!
PILOT: B-1's time on target, 30 seconds. 2,000-pound JDAMs inbound.
We're gonna make a break through the B's on my command, okay?
You guys stick with me, you understand? You stay on my ass.
PILOT: 1-1 tally orange smoke.
I hope these F-16s got good aim.
Yeah? Why is that?
I told them to hit the orange smoke.
You mean that orange smoke?
It wasn't my best toss, okay?
PILOT: Viper, thunder.
Run!
Incoming!
Come on!
Sam!
Run!
Die!
Sam!
LENNOX: Hold your fire!
Sam!
Stay back! Mikaela, stay back!
Fucking do something!
Sam! Sam!
Sam! Sam! Sam! Sammy! Sam!
-Let me go! -LENNOX: Come, you gotta move.
You got to move, come on.
MEDIC: We got no pulse.
Starting CPR.
I have to see my kid! I got a son...
I have to see my kid! I got a son... Sammy!
Sam!
MEDIC 1: Clear. MEDIC 2: Ready to shock.
Clear!
MEDIC 2: Ready to shock. One, two, three.
(DEFIBRILLATOR BUZZES) Do it again!
No!
Okay, listen to my voice. I love you and I need you.
Please. Please, come back to me. Sam, please!
I love you.
SAM: Where am I? Where am I? Am I dead? Am I dead?
PRIME: We have been watching you a long, long time.
You have fought for Optimus, our last descendant,
with courage and with sacrifice, the virtues of a leader,
a leader worthy of our secret.
The Matrix of Leadership is not found, it is earned.
Return now to Optimus.
Merge the Matrix with his spark.
It is, and always has been, your destiny.
Sam!
I love you. I love you.
Boy, you returned for me.
A living Prime.
I don't believe it!
My Matrix!
Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!
JETFIRE: Get up, Prime!
Oh, no.
SAM: He's turning on the machine!
You got to stop him! Get up!
Optimus!
MEGATRON: Fallen, my master.
My brothers could not stop me from this.
Yes, now I claim your sun.
Move!
Enemy target, top of pyramid. Engage!
Engage! Engage!
In moments, we'll be at firing strength.
All my Decepticon life, I never did a thing worth doing until now.
Optimus, take my parts
and you will have a power you've never known.
Fulfill your destiny.
Jolt! Electrify!
Transplant those afterburners.
Let's roll.
SOLDIER: Fire mission on the pyramids.
This planet will be dark forever.
Die, like your brothers!
They were your brothers, too.
Starscream!
You picked the wrong planet.
Give me your face.
I rise.
You fall.
No, no.
Not to call you a coward, Master,
but sometimes cowards do survive.
This isn't over.
It took all this for you to tell me that you love me.
You said it first.
Thank you, Sam, for saving my life.
Welcome.
Thank you for believing in me.
OPTIMUS: Our races united by a history long forgotten
and a future we shall face together.
I am Optimus Prime,
and I send this message so that our
pasts will always be remembered,
for in those memories, we live on.
So glad you could join us, Professor Einstein.
(STUDENTS LAUGHING) Yeah, I was kind of busy.
over and over again, and each time the same question.
-[footsteps approaching] -Is this it?
Will this time be the one?
And each time the same answer.
And I'm just so tired of it.
[Booker] You good? -[Andy] Yeah. -Yeah?
-[Andy] Yeah. -Yeah?
You travel?
I did.
And I got you something.
What's that?
-Ooh, first edition Don Quixote. -Mmm-hmm.
-That couldn't have been cheap. -It wasn't.
So why am I here, Booker?
[Booker] You remember Surabaya eight years ago, right?
[Andy] CIA.
[Booker] Yeah. The guy who hired us, James Copley, reached out.
He's freelance now.
He has a hostage situation in South Sudan.
No, Booker. We don't do repeats. You know that.
It's too risky.
Andy.
Joe and Nicky?
At the hotel.
[clerk] Come back again.
Thank you. Welcome to El Fenn, sir.
-[Booker speaking French] -Checking in?
-[in French] What brings you to Marrakesh? -Family.
Would you like me to take one for you?
[tourist] Oh, thank you so much. I just really suck at taking selfies.
-[camera clicks] -There you go. [tourists] Thank you!
-You look great. -You look okay.
[laughing] Thank you! Thank you!
And I have something for you.
Nicky!
-[Booker chuckling] -[Andy] Baklava.
Five hundred, Booker.
-[Booker scoffs] -[Andy] No.
[Booker] All right.
-All in. Here it is. -[Andy] Really?
-[Nicky] All in! -[Joe] All in!
Hazelnut, not walnut.
The Black Sea.
Rosewater.
Pomegranate.
Eastern Turkey.
-[Joe] No, no, no. Don't worry. -[laughing]
Admit it, boss. You missed us.
I did.
It's a job, guys.
We can do some good.
Have you been watching the news lately?
Some good means nothing.
I don't know about this, guys.
We're not helping.
I know you needed a break, but it's been over a year, boss.
This is what we do, Andy.
I'll hear him out.
[Booker] Mr. Copley. Mr. Booker, bonjour.
-It's a pleasure to finally meet you. -Last time I checked,
-you had to be American to be in the CIA. -[laughs]
[Copley] I was born in Boston.
Moved to London when I was three.
So why did you leave the agency, Mr. Copley?
My wife got sick.
ALS.
She died two years ago.
Just haven't found my way back yet.
-Sorry for your loss. -Thank you.
You haven't aged a day, Booker.
-Trust me, I have. -[Copley laughs] Yeah.
Yesterday afternoon local,
a school southwest of Juba was attacked by a militia.
They murdered the teachers and abducted 17 of the students at gunpoint.
The youngest was eight...
oldest, 13.
South Sudanese asked the US for help,
but current administration's policy is to deny aid to any nonstrategic allies.
Some of my ex-colleagues at the CIA feel differently.
They reached out to me, and I'm reaching out to you.
The last overfly confirmed the personnel on site.
No food or water being brought in.
[Andy] That means they're moving them soon.
And when they do,
most likely they'll be separated, and odds are we'll never find them again.
Has to be done quickly...
by the best, and your team's the best I've ever seen.
You can name your price.
We'll invoice you when it's done.
[in Nuer] Peace be with you.
[Andy] What the...
[Nicky] Are we too late?
Motherfuck--
[soldier] Room clear!
-[soldier 1] Oh, my God! -[soldier 2] Shit!
-[soldiers exclaiming] -[soldier] Look out! Reload!
-[soldier 2] What the hell? -[exclaiming continues]
-[all shouting] -[guns firing]
-Everyone still with me? -[Booker] Yeah.
-[Nicky speaking Italian] -[groans]
[Andy] Joe?
Very pissed off.
So where are the girls?
There never were any girls.
We've been set up.
[Copley] Yeah, I got it.
Yeah.
One has to admire Mr. Copley's attention to detail.
Those shoes were a particularly grotesque touch.
I knew this was gonna happen.
I said it.
We did it right, Andy. -For the right reasons. -And what did it get us, Nicky? What?
-For the right reasons. -And what did it get us, Nicky? What?
Nothing.
We've done nothing.
The world isn't getting any better.
It's getting worse.
I checked him completely, and...
everything seemed legit.
I'm sorry, guys.
They know who we are. They know what we are.
We have to find Copley.
We have to tie this thing off.
-And then what? -And then nothing.
The world can burn for all I care.
I'm done.
Freeman, where you at?
Here, Sergeant.
The women are holed up in the house with the arches.
Take a right at the building with the red carpet.
-Get me some information. -Roger that.
[Nile] Keep it respectful.
[Jay] Don't we always?
Never hurts to repeat it.
[in Pashto] My name is Nile.
I am an American Marine.
[in English] We are looking for this man.
He has killed many of our people and many of yours.
Have any of you seen him?
You do not disrespect your family
by telling us where he is.
There are no men here.
To use women as shields is to be no man at all.
Thank you for allowing us into your home.
[in Pashto] We will leave you in peace.
Breach!
-Stop! -[gun cocks]
-[Nile] Clear! Covering! -[Jay] Clear!
Lima 3, this is India 5. Contact, over.
Jay, go check on the women. On it.
[Dizzy] Look at all this shit. It's jackpot.
Not if he bleeds out. They wanted him alive, remember?
[man] Do not... Do not touch me.
I'm trying to save you, man.
Dizzy, a little help, please?
No! Medic!
Man down!
No! Jesus! Medic!
Stay with me!
Oh, my...
God! Jesus, no.
Come here. Stay with me. Look at me.
Come here. Stay with me. Look at me. Look at me. You're gonna be okay.
Look at me. You're gonna be okay.
Nile! Nile!
You're okay. It's okay. Stay with me. Just look at me. Look at me.
Okay. Medic's on their way. Medic's on their way.
No, no. It's okay. It's okay.
The medic's coming!
What the...
[Andy] No.
No, not another one.
Not now.
It was a woman.
A black woman.
I saw an older woman in a hijab.
What did you see?
I saw... I saw part of a name tag.
Uh, yeah. Free... free something.
-Yeah. -Dirt floor, clay walls.
And a medevac.
[Joe] Yeah, so maybe a, uh... a coalition...
medical team.
The knife was a pesh-kabz. Pashtun.
[groans] I felt her die.
[Andy] She's a Marine.
Combat.
Or near-combat duty.
Afghanistan.
It's been over 200 years.
Why now?
Everything happens for a reason, boss.
We have to find her.
No, we stick to the plan. We find Copley.
-So we just leave her out in the open? -No, we're in the open.
-We're the ones who are exposed now. -Not like her.
Nicky--
Not like her.
You can't tell me you don't remember what it was like.
Whoever she is, she's confused, and she's scared,
and she's more alone than she has ever been in her entire life.
We all remember what it was like.
[Nicky] She needs us.
I'll handle the retrieval.
Hey, boss, come on.
If we're dreaming about her, she's dreaming about us.
That makes her a beacon straight to us.
-What do we do in the meantime? -Get to France.
Use the Charlie safe house.
I'll meet you there.
Find Copley.
Jesus.
She's just a baby.
[Dizzy] I know I saw her die.
[Jay] A little blood can look like a lot.
Adrenaline flying, everyone was seeing shit they didn't.
I was holding her neck together in my hands.
You'd rather we sent her home in a body bag?
No, of course not.
So come on.
[Jay] Hey, look who's up.
Nile?
What's up, Jay?
What's up, Dizzy?
So let's see the trophy.
Fuck me.
Nile, there's not even a scratch.
Yeah, they, uh...
They used this new skin graft or something.
That what the doctor said?
[Nile] Yeah.
That's what they said.
[Merrick] Our average lifespan is 78 in developed nations.
Actually, two more years if you're lucky enough to be born a female.
-[chuckles] What can I say, ladies? -[audience laughing]
Now, all of this is because of everyone's favorite love-to-hate...
Big Pharma.
At my company, our research on telomere extension
has reversed the chromosomal clock of human stem cells.
Dr. Kozak's manipulation of the klotho hormone will, in time,
completely arrest common cognitive decline.
Yes, we can all wave goodbye to dementia.
-[applause] -Now... wait! Our work will add years of life to the collective world population.
-Years. Decades. -[applause]
But it's not cheap.
We need investment.
Investment drives my enthusiasm to take risks.
These risks improve countless lives.
[Merrick] My God.
[Copley] You've seen my research.
Now you know they're for real.
What about the hard proof?
Blood, tissue, bone, DNA.
Recovering an uncontaminated sample of the site proved impossible.
But you promised me hard proof.
There was an unanticipated amount of carnage.
-But the footage-- -No, no.
The footage is a two-million-dollar snuff film.
It doesn't give her the how.
-I need all of them, Copley. -[scoffs]
-I think I can get you one. -No. No, not one. All.
These are extraordinary individuals.
They are extremely resistant to capture.
Well, consult with Keane, make a plan, make it happen.
And quickly, before my competitors get wind of this.
[soldier] Corporal Freeman.
-Aye, Sergeant. -Orders just came through.
They're sending you to Landstuhl, Germany for more tests.
But I'm fine.
Plane's fueling. Pack your bags.
-Sergeant-- -We took these off you when it happened.
Didn't think you were coming back.
[soldier] That's her.
[soldier] Corporal Freeman.
Been looking for you.
Wheels up on your ride.
-Who are you? -Andromache the Scythian.
But you can call me Andy.
Why does it have to be so goddamn slow the first couple of times?
You shot me.
I did. I need you to get back in the car, please.
[panting] This isn't real. No, none of this is real.
You haven't figured this out yet? You can't die.
Get up.
Argh! Fuck!
Can you please not do that again?
Who are you?
I lead a group of immortals.
An army, I guess.
Soldiers. Fighters like you.
Look...
You've got questions, kid. I get it.
You want answers?
Get back in the car.
Put those on.
-Where are you taking me? -Paris.
-You've got blood in your hair. -Wonder why?
[Nile] This guy's a drug runner.
This the shit you into?
Well, sometimes you gotta work with people you don't wanna eat with.
Is this even safe?
Does it really matter?
[Booker] Hey, boss.
You found Copley?
Nothing but dead ends.
He knows we're hunting him.
Keep looking.
He's doing the same to us.
I have the new one. And?
Well, she stabbed me, so I think she has potential.
I'll see you soon.
So why is this happening to me?
I wish I knew.
You said you had answers.
I didn't say you'd like them.
Are you praying?
God doesn't exist.
My God does.
You know, there was a time when I was worshiped as a god.
Was that Him?
Don't worry, I can't do shit like that.
None of it means anything anyway.
You said there were others.
How many?
Four.
You're an army of four?
So that's why you took me? So I could join your army?
Yeah.
No. This is some bullshit.
You must... [scoffs] ...must have hypnotized me, or... or, uh, drugged me or something.
And that was a blank that you shot me with.
And I was the one who cut your throat.
Right?
Listen, kid. You already believe in...
You should just keep following that illogic.
You're already on board with the supernatural.
If I were you, I'd get some sleep.
We're not going to Paris.
Andrei.
Come here.
Sit your ass down!
-Stand up! -[Nile] You do not listen to her.
You listen to me.
Land this plane.
Trust me. She's not gonna shoot you.
I am.
Who's gonna fly the plane?
We don't need a pilot.
We can jump and survive.
I am not jumping from a plane!
Whoa! Shit! Maybe we do need a pilot.
I can fly a plane.
You don't speak Russian, do you?
Why?
Because I told the pilot to play dead.
You really want to do this, kid?
We're done.
I said we're done.
You're very good.
What's your name?
Nile.
You see? You're already healing faster.
Is this real?
I got people that love me.
People that are gonna worry.
I'm a Marine.
-They think I went AWOL. -You're not a Marine anymore.
They're going to lock you up.
I thought you said we were going to Paris.
We're just outside of Paris. This is Goussainville.
This place has been abandoned for 50 years.
-Why? -[plane flying overhead]
So are you good guys or bad guys?
Depends on the century.
We fight for what we think is right.
How are you all in my dreams?
We dream of each other. They stop when we meet.
[Nile] Why?
I believe it's because we... we're meant to find each other.
It's like destiny.
No, more like misery loves company.
What he said.
It used to take years to track a new one. Booker was the last.
1812.
No way.
Yeah, I died fighting with Napoleon.
So... you're even older than him.
Mmm... Nicky and I met in the Crusades.
The Crusades?
The love of my life was of the people I've been taught to hate.
We killed each other.
-Many times. -[Joe] Yeah.
You're the oldest.
Yeah.
So how old are you?
-Old. -How old?
Too old.
So we really never die.
Nothing that lives lives forever.
But... you said that we were immortal.
I know what I said.
And we mostly are, but we can die.
And one of us did.
He...
He was a warrior, just like us.
A long time ago.
One day your wounds just don't heal up anymore, and...
One day your wounds just don't heal up anymore, and... we don't know when or why.
So if we can die,
then why would you shoot me?
You could have killed me.
You're too new.
It is a lot to understand.
I think you should get some rest.
Come with me. I'll show you.
She wants to talk to her family.
That's not gonna help her.
You tell her that.
What's going on?
[Booker] What happened?
[grunts] It's just a... a bad dream.
[groans] I'm sorry.
Tell us.
I saw flashes of it before... when I first dreamt of all of you.
But now it's clearer.
I dreamed about a woman locked in an iron coffin...
under the sea.
She kept... drowning and then coming back to life.
She was hammering her bloody fists and knees against the iron.
She felt like something insane, something furious.
But she kept fighting... and she kept drowning.
Her name was Quynh.
[Joe] She was one of us.
The first immortal Andy found.
They had been alone so long, when she found her... Quynh had given up.
Way back, it was her and Andy.
Before me and Nicky, it was just the two of them.
They ran through the world together. Fought thousands of battles side by side.
She was a pit viper in a fight.
[Nicky] They were in England,
freeing so-called heretics from the witch trials.
But then, Andy and Quynh,
they were accused of witchcraft themselves,
-and they were trapped and caught. -[man] Killers!
[woman] Some will rot in hell!
[Joe] When they didn't die, it proved their case,
and they got sentenced again and again.
I've never been burned alive before.
What do you think it's gonna be like?
Excruciating.
Just you and me.
Until the end.
No! No!
No! No! No, not this.
-[Quynh] No! -Where are you taking her?
-[Quynh screams] -You are too powerful together.
For creatures such as you, there is no salvation.
[Quynh screaming] Please! No!
Quynh!
Quynh!
[Quynh screaming] Andromache!
-[Andy yelling] -[Quynh] Andromache!
[Andy] No!
[Nicky] After Andy escaped, we spent decades searching for her
or anyone on that ship who could tell us where she was cast off.
[Joe] She's lived with that guilt ever since, but she blames herself for Quynh's fate.
Why do you blame yourself?
I lost a soldier.
I feel her pain.
Her rage.
She feels crazy.
Over 500 years in a box...
at the bottom of the ocean...
would make anyone insane.
[Nicky] That's the reason why we dread capture.
Spend eternity in a cage.
[Andy] Nile.
[Nile] I don't want this. I don't want any of it.
I know. I know.
There isn't one good thing in any of this.
I know this is hard.
It's happening whether you want it or not.
I know you're scared, Nile.
Me and those three men in there will keep you safe.
Like Quynh?
We're all you've got.
What's happening?
They found us.
Joe? Nicky?
Shit.
Booker.
You still with me?
Clear the back room. Find Joe and Nicky.
Hey. Hey.
Book.
Come on.
Come back to me.
You're still in this shitty game with me.
You hear me?
Now wake up.
-Wake up! -[groans loudly]
[Nile] They're not here.
Welcome back, asshole.
Thanks for taking your time.
It hurts everywhere.
How bad is it?
It's an improvement.
How many?
I don't know. -Where are Nicky and Joe? -I don't know!
-Where are Nicky and Joe? -I don't know!
I... I turned on the game.
[Booker] A grenade hit me.
Lost the plot after that.
-[soldier on radio] Two in transport. -No, no. We need the woman.
Wasn't there, and the other guy's in pieces.
She's there.
-Copley. -Copley?
[Andy] They're coming back. They want all of us.
You stay here.
Wait for my signal.
What signal? -What does that even mean? -[laughing] You'll know it when it comes.
-What does that even mean? -[laughing] You'll know it when it comes.
And, by the way, it's not always like this now.
Big wounds take longer to heal.
Sure.
[soldier] Bravo Team approaching church.
[soldier] Go, go, go.
[soldier] Come on! Move! Move!
-[soldier yelling] -We've gotta get out there! We need to help her.
No, that's not the signal.
Mr. Keane,
I strongly recommend that we leave right now.
[Nile] Come on!
Let's move!
Wait for the signal.
How the hell can you even tell?
-Oh. -Let's go!
Andy did all this herself?
Yeah. That woman has forgotten more ways to kill
than entire armies will ever learn.
[Nile] Who are they? How'd they find you? I don't know. Let's go!
Nicolo.
-Quiet. -[in Italian] Nicolo, wake up.
-[in English] I said-- -I know what you said.
What are you gonna do? Kill me?
[in Italian] Wake up. Wake up! [Nicky] I'm here. I'm here.
Wherever here is.
In an armored van.
They used gas.
[in English] I told you, shut up!
I need to know he's okay.
[soldier] That's sweet.
What is he? Your boyfriend?
You're a child.
An infant.
Your mocking is thus infantile.
He's not my boyfriend.
This man is more to me than you can dream.
He's the moon when I'm lost in darkness and warmth when I shiver in cold.
And his kiss still thrills me, even after a millennia.
His heart overflows with the kindness of which this world is not worthy of.
I love this man beyond measure and reason. He's not my boyfriend.
He's all and he's more.
You're an incurable romantic.
I don't suppose it would be possible to get these chains off of us?
[Keane] Get 'em out! Get 'em out! Get 'em on the plane now!
I guess not.
We are usually a better judge of character.
I suppose you are taking us to the person who paid for your betrayal.
It's a nice plane.
[Nicky] There's a TV, Joe.
[Joe] Champagne?
What is this place?
An abandoned mine.
We stumbled on it during the Baussenque Wars.
1150s maybe?
I used to keep my stuff here.
Is this a Rodin?
[Andy] Yeah.
This is an honest-to-God Rodin.
Wait. Did you know him?
Probably biblically. [laughs]
Get to work finding Copley.
He's got Nicky and Joe.
[Merrick] It can hardly be unique if they can make another copy.
I've got to go.
Ah! Gentlemen, welcome.
I am truly honored to meet you. [chuckles]
Together, we shall do such things.
What they are yet, I know not,
but they shall be the terrors of the Earth.
Or, um, rather the saviors.
Lear... Shakespeare.
Um, can we take the cuffs off?
No, sir. We can't.
My apologies. Let's get off on the right foot, shall we?
I'm Steven Merrick, youngest CEO in pharma.
Our work here is all about balance.
How do we push the scientific frontiers whilst also turning a little profit?
There's your balance, asshole.
-[Keane] Mr. Merrick? -Yes, yes, yes.
[Keane] Watch it.
Mr. Copley provided me with footage of your unique talent,
but I prefer my evidence to be indisputable.
-[all clamoring] -[Nicky] No!
-Mr. Merrick! -[Joe groans]
God damn it! Ugh!
Shit!
[Merrick] What do you see?
The Nobel Prize. [chuckles]
And a fair few quid to boot.
We brought a cancer drug to the market last quarter.
It's already saved hundreds of thousands of lives.
Yet, in development, it killed a quarter of a million lab mice.
Now, I didn't ask for their little permissions.
I'm not gonna ask for yours.
He thinks you're a mouse, Nicky.
[Merrick] There's genetic code inside you which could help every human being on Earth.
We're morally obliged to take it.
What?
-[Joe] What is that? Wait! -[Nicky] Hey!
No!
I'll keep you informed of my progress. Yes. Yes, you do that.
Mr. Merrick...
this is about science, not profits... or sadism.
You owe me two more.
Come on, Book. You've been working on that for hours.
[Booker] He's a security expert. He leaves no footprints. It's gonna take time.
You got a satellite link?
[Booker] Yeah.
[Nile] Follow the money. Whoever he's working for, maybe?
That's how we track militants.
I'm sure you already tried that.
Yeah, it won't hurt to try again.
You know how it works, Nile.
Get some sleep while you can. I brought you a change of clothes.
I'm going out for a bit.
-Are you all right, boss? -[Andy] Yeah.
Just because we keep living doesn't mean we stop hurting.
Why us? Yeah.
That way madness lies.
I thought you were the brains of this outfit.
Tell you what I do wonder...
is why you?
And why now?
How old is Andy?
Well, she says she... she doesn't remember.
And she may not. I don't know.
But what I do know is she was alone for a long time
before she found anyone like her.
A very long time.
What about you? You have someone?
Just my family.
I had three sons.
And the youngest one, Jean-Pierre...
was the last one to die.
He was 42 when...
cancer took him.
The only way is forward now.
What do you mean?
You'll always and forever be the young woman right there...
but everyone around you, everyone you love...
is gonna grow old,
is gonna... is gonna suffer and is gonna die.
And if you try to... if you try to touch their lives...
well, they will get to learn your secret.
They will beg you to share it with them, and you won't be able to.
And they won't believe you, of course.
And they will tell you...
that you don't love them.
That your love is weak...
or selfish.
And you will never forget...
the hate... and despair in their eyes.
And you will know what it is to lose...
everyone you've ever loved.
Do you have a bathroom? No.
But we have a storeroom.
Do you need help?
Stitches would be better, but... this will help.
You haven't asked.
Your business is yours.
You need help.
What does it matter why?
Today, I put this on your wound. Tomorrow...
you help someone up when they fall.
We're not meant to be alone.
There.
This should do.
Thank you.
[Quynh] Andromache, help me!
Why won't it stop?
This can't be happening. Lykon.
It's time.
It's impossible.
[Lykon] It's time.
[Copley] How long will the testing take?
Until we have results we can replicate.
Do you feel the wound trying to close?
[Copley] You don't need them for that.
You've got the samples, blood, tissue, DNA.
Well, you know the concept of proprietary data,
and they're the product.
They go in the vault. They stay there under lock and key.
For... ever?
We can't have them strolling back out into the world...
into my competitors' laps.
If this takes years, maybe decades, what does it matter to them?
If we can unlock their genetic code, the world will be begging us for the key.
Remarkable.
You will not be able to give him what he wants.
You think I go too far? That I am unethical?
I would say immoral.
I believe this can change the world.
A fine justification.
I've heard it so many times before.
As much as I like watching you sleep, I'm glad you're awake.
Bed head?
Nicely tousled.
Do you know, I was thinking about Malta.
What time in Malta?
Oh, that time in Malta.
[in Italian] We should go back there.
That would be nice.
[in English] Your mom and brother?
You have my phone?
[Andy] Where's your father?
Killed in action when I was 11.
Here...
My mom, she was drowning after he died.
South Side of Chicago,
a million different ways we could have went left.
She fought for us.
Never backed down.
Never let us back down either.
You come from warriors.
Yeah.
I do.
I can't remember what my mother looked like.
Or my sisters.
None of them.
[Nile] Time steals it all away, I guess.
[Andy] It's not what time steals...
it's what it leaves behind.
Things you can't forget.
I gave up searching for her.
I made Quynh a promise and I broke it.
I'm getting Joe and Nicky back.
Whatever it takes.
"Whatever it takes"?
Yes.
[Booker] Guys, I found something. An address just outside of London.
We gotta go.
Go scout the back.
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.
I mean, I'm not doing this.
You're one of us now. We would do the same for you.
-I never even had a choice. -None of us had a choice.
There isn't a choice.
The day I died,
I killed the guy that killed me.
They try to condition us, you know?
Thousands of hours of training.
Two shots, quick kill.
But they can't teach you how to live with it.
You've gotta feel it, Nile.
Every one.
I saw what you did in that church.
All those bodies.
Is that supposed to be me?
Is that what we're supposed to do, and we don't even know why?
You think knowing is gonna make you sleep better at night?
I can't be that.
My family,
they're gonna get old and I won't,
but it'll be years before they realize that.
I still have time with them.
Here.
Take the car,
and when you ditch it, ditch the weapons.
You gonna be okay?
Always.
Where's Nile?
You and me, Book. Now and always.
[automated voice] Guildford station in one mile.
Empty?
Shit.
Andy.
[Andy] Where are they?
Andromache the Scythian.
The eternal warrior.
-Book? -I'm right here.
Where are Joe and Nicky?
What are you doing?
[Booker] Calm down.
-What are you doing? -Andy, calm down!
[Andy screaming] No!
You set us up?
[Booker] Please listen.
When my wife died, I devoted myself to your work.
I learned your secret history, written in the margins...
passed on like legend.
What was dismissed as a myth was, in fact, immortality.
You could help end... needless suffering.
Humanity needs you to share your gifts.
Humanity can screw itself. [groans]
-[Booker] Andy-- -Don't, you fucking coward.
Why?
Why, Book?
-Andy, listen-- -Why?
If Merrick can discover how we keep living,
he might find a way how to end it.
Hey.
That's what you wanted.
Oh, Book. What have you done?
Not like this, Book.
-[Booker] What's going on? -[Andy moans]
[Booker] You're still bleeding.
You're still bleeding.
What? Shit. She's not healing.
-What? -Look at this. She's not healing.
Go get something. Go on! Go on!
Andy, look at me.
Look at me.
Why didn't you tell me?
It wouldn't have changed anything.
Hurry up!
-[Andy moans] -[Booker] Come on. Careful.
-[Booker] Get her out of here. -[door opens]
[Keane] Secure him.
Nice work, Copley.
Look at you.
She's wounded. Gunshot.
Why isn't she healing? I don't know.
She's not immortal.
-What do you mean, "not immortal?" -I mean it's gone.
You're a bloody mess.
Now, how old are you?
Come closer and I'll tell you.
Let's get them home.
-[Booker] Let her go. -[Keane] Cover me.
-[Andy] No! No! -Let her go! [grunts]
-Get her up. -[Andy yelling]
[Andy] No!
-[injector hissing] -[Booker] I'm sorry, Andy.
I'm sorry.
-[soldier] Hold him still. -[injector hissing]
Mr. Merrick, look. If it's true and she's somehow not immortal anymore,
then she might not survive the testing.
-This will be murder. -As if the CIA never disappeared anyone.
As if they never conducted covert research.
No.
No, this is not what we agreed.
We don't stop.
Andy.
-What happened? -[Andy groans]
She's not healing.
I killed her.
I need to get a line in her and stop the bleeding.
[Merrick] Keep her alive at all costs.
Don't you see? Between Sudan and now, something's changed.
-Find out what. -[Kozak] This will stabilize her,
-Find out what. -[Kozak] This will stabilize her, but I have to stitch her
-and give her antibiotics. -[Merrick] Good.
All things die.
What was that?
Everything has to die, Mr. Merrick.
The only reason we haven't...
is that it's not our time yet.
If it's now Andromache's, nothing you can do will stop it.
You'd be surprised by what my products can do.
I will carve slices off you for years to get what I want.
Your time is coming.
As is yours.
I expect results!
Andy.
Are you Copley?
-He sent you to finish me off. -Who?
Where's Andy and Booker? Who are you?
-[Copley exclaims] -Son of a bitch!
You're another one. Yeah. I'm new.
Yeah. I'm new.
-Where are they? -They're in a lab... being tested.
Tortured.
Merrick... he only cares about her immortality,
not what she's done with it.
"What she's done with it"?
[Copley] Montenegro, 1916.
She saved a family of refugees whose daughter would discover
the technique for the early detection of diabetes.
This one... Her grandson would save 317 people from the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
Her grandson would save 317 people from the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
This guy...
This man prevented an accidental nuclear exchange in 1978
and likely saved civilization as a result.
The famous...
and the unknown names.
She saves a life, two, three generations later, we reap the benefits.
She's in it.
She can't see it.
But you could.
You could and you gave them up.
I thought it could be the end of disease.
I thought it could be the end of suffering.
She couldn't talk...
at the end... my wife.
She couldn't breathe.
I couldn't do... anything.
It was supposed to be a gift...
to the world.
It wasn't your gift to give.
Why would the immortality end?
What?
She wouldn't stop bleeding.
Is she alive?
I know where they are.
There's no cameras here. That's how he gets people in and out unseen.
-[Nile] How many shooters on site? -[Copley] At least 30.
Their boss, Keane, is ex-Special Forces.
What kind of CEO rolls around with his own personal army?
These days? [chuckles]
Most of them.
-What are you doing? -I'm gonna make this right.
Your dying won't do that.
But I'm supposed to let you walk in there by yourself?
Out of the two of us,
I'm the one who will walk out of there again,
one way or another.
You got me here.
There's a private lab on the 15th floor.
It's empty.
-[card reader beeps] -This will get you access.
You should get out of here before the noise starts.
Good luck, Ms. Freeman.
Floor's closed. How'd you get up here? Sorry, I was just looking--
Hands! Let me see your hands.
Zero, this is Alpha 2-2.
[man] Sir.
Zero. Send.
[guard] We've had an intruder. Target is down.
See if you can get an ID off the body.
Shit! TAC teams, find Merrick now!
-You selfish piece of shit! -Joe, leave it. Please!
What do you know of the weight of all these years alone?
-You're a very pathetic man, Booker. -[Nicky] Joe, Stop.
You and Nicky always had each other, right?
And all we had... was our grief.
Well, now you have even more.
-Who the hell are you? -Where's the lab?
Shit! [both] There's another one!
She's going for the rest of them. Doctor's lab, now!
I'm locking you down in the penthouse until this is over.
[Booker] Nile.
-Behind you! -[gun firing]
[Nicky] Nile!
There's four shooters at the door and more coming.
Andy.
Immortal or not, you made a promise.
Whatever it takes.
I've seen it, Andy.
I know all the good you've done.
You came back.
Yeah.
No, just leave me here.
No man left behind.
There's always a first time. He's nothing but a traitor. That's--
Stop! This is not the time for it.
We don't get a say in when it ends. We never have.
But we can control how we live.
And to be honest, Book,
you and I, we've been doing a shit job of it.
Now, get up. -[cocks gun] -Let's go.
We stop Merrick here and now or he never stops coming after us.
[Nicky] Andy.
Are you sure?
This changes nothing.
We walk out of here like always. Together.
Let's get this motherfucker.
[Joe] Cover Andy.
[Nile] Andy! Ahh!
[Booker] Man! Andy!
-[Booker] Joe, Nicky, we're moving out! -[coughing]
Assault team, move! You two, flank.
[soldier on radio] What's your location?
[Andy] Enough of this shit.
Let's go. Andy.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Shit! Jammed!
Where's Andy?
[soldier 1 on radio] Hold at the bridge.
-[soldier 2] Roger that. -Fuck.
Where's Merrick?
Penthouse.
What do you think? Oslo, '67?
São Paulo, '34. Nile's with me.
What happened in São Paulo in 1934?
1834. You'll see.
First team, hold the hall.
First team.
Wait for the signal.
This gonna be like the last signal?
Go big or go home.
Keane.
Keane, how many more do we have coming?
This is it. Dig in.
I'll make the entry.
Stay tight to me, okay?
I'll protect you.
I go through first. I always go first.
Andy, put on the damn armor.
It's like Nicky said, "If it's my time, it's my time."
If this doesn't work out,
next time, you go first.
What the hell are they waiting for?
[Keane] Shit!
You shot Nicky. You shouldn't have done that.
[Nicky] The elevator is going down!
-Merrick is getting away! -Go!
I'll stay with Andy.
You okay? [exhales] Yeah, I'm fine.
It just hurts.
Actually, everything hurts.
Well, wait until tomorrow.
Can't wait.
I think you showed up when I lost my immortality.
So I could see what it was like.
So I could remember.
Remember?
Remember what it...
what it was like to feel unbreakable. [laughs]
Remarkable.
You reminded me there are people...
still worth fighting for.
I know how I want to spend the time I've got left.
You're gonna spend it with us, Andy.
You selfish little bitch!
I will kill her!
All the lives you could save.
Don't you see what we could do here?
You are priceless.
Hey, Nile.
Do you think he speaks Russian?
Play dead, motherfucker.
[Nicky] Nile?
Hey.
[Nicky] She's okay.
Come on.
Faster than the elevator.
[Nicky] It's okay, Nile.
-Ow! -[Booker] Give me your hand.
[Booker] Let's go.
♪ I've been quiet for too long ♪
[Booker] How's it going?
They're still deciding.
There's not much to decide. It's not like they can kill me.
[Booker] Oh, she gave it back?
Yeah.
Talked to Copley.
Said he could fix it.
Make it look like I was killed in action.
My family will mourn, but, uh...
...they'll be able to move on.
It's just like what we did with my dad.
I just really want to hear my mom's voice one more time.
You're a good kid, Nile.
You're gonna be great for the team.
There's got to be a price.
One hundred years from today, they'll meet you here.
Till then, you're alone.
I hoped for less, but...
I expected more.
Nile was gonna let you off with an apology.
Just give her some time.
I'm gonna miss you.
I won't see you again.
Have a little faith, Book.
♪ It's a cruel world ♪ ♪ You can't see it ♪
[Copley] This is only what I've found going back the last 150 years or so.
When you think about how old you are,
the good you've done for humanity becomes exponential.
Maybe this is the why, Andy.
It's nearly impossible to disappear in the world we live in today.
There are too many people like you who can bend it to your will.
Too many with bad intentions.
We don't have all the answers, but we do have purpose.
And you're going to help us.
When we leave a footprint in the sand, in the snow, in the ether,
When we leave a footprint in the sand, in the snow, in the ether, you're going to sweep it.
You're going to protect us from those who want to put us in cages,
and you're gonna help us find those jobs...
that are best suited to us.
She's not asking.
I'd be honored.
Then let's go to work.
[woman] Booker.
It's nice to finally meet you.
And the worst-case scenario, you're two weeks ahead of me, you get a gorgeous little apartment in the Marais.
you're two weeks ahead of me, you get a gorgeous little apartment in the Marais.
What if I don't want to live in the Marais?
[ Man ] We could live somewhere else then.
Yeah. Yeah?
We could go to Detroit.
- Detroit? - Yeah, you could meet my mom and dad.
You can meet my sister. She owns a bakery.
- And she will make you fat. - [ Laughs ]
I have six hours before I have to go back to the hospital.
You wanna go back into bed with me?
[ Beeping ] I do.
But I got back-to-back meetings all morning.
Too bad for you.
[ Beeping ] Yeah, I know. But I gotta get in.
There's probably already 25 people lined up outside the door, waiting.
I love when you speak French.
[ Woman ]nging ] SATCOM check.
Echo Nine Three Victor Echo Two.
[ Man ] Ops Center.
This is safe house seven-R. We're open for business.
Confirmed.
Any reservations?
Nothing in the registry.
Walk-ins? Not expected.
Walk-ins? Not expected. Reconfirm in three hours.
Understood.
[ Man ] Matt. Your cell. Really?
Relax. I've got an encryption packet.
Well, you know me. I never relax.
Watch the cholesterol, old man.
You sound like Miriam.
So, what's new in Cape Town? Nothing, nothing.
I updated my Surveillance Target Analysis. It's complete now.
Yeah, that's an exit report. It's not due till you leave.
Exactly. Exactly. And when-- when is that?
How long has it been?
Twelve months. Well, talk to me in another four.
Je-- David, I'm-- I'm dying here.
What's happening with the post in Paris?
One slot and 37 applicants.
Every one of them with more field experience than you.
Okay, how am I supposed to get more experience?
I'm staring at four walls all day.
I got passed up on Rome, then Berlin.
You said yourself my evaluation was excellent.
Just put it in front of Whitford.
I know he'll see that I'm ready to go, I'm all in.
Matt, I know this has been hard, but it's the way the system works.
Look, I'll talk to Whitford about Paris, but I can't promise anything.
Look, I gotta go.
Don't worry. I'm looking after you, okay?
Yeah, I know. I know. I know.
[ Man ] This is not a negotiation.
It's 10 million.
You'll get the file, and if the money is not in the account by 3:00 p.m.,
I'll take it to another buyer.
[ Man #2 ] How do we know that you won't do that anyway?
You don't.
Here you are, sir.
Alec. How are you?
Petrus. 1972.
- You look good. - I do, don't I?
So, how are things at MI6? The usual.
Same bureaucratic bullshit and appalling remuneration.
Life of a government man. Mm-hmm.
So--
The original file. Dates, transactions, names.
A bargain at triple the price.
Take a look.
I've been waiting a long time for this.
Tobin. What's in that box...
is gonna make the world a smaller place for you-- for both of us.
I got your account. You get your cut 24 hours after transaction.
Some of our old bosses aren't going to be happy these files are out in the open.
Do I make you nervous?
Always. Good.
You want her?
Please listen to me.
I had nothing to do with this.
Stop.
[ Sirens Wailing ] Let's go.
Tobin, you have to believe me.
I knew nothing about any of that.
Did you know if anybody was following you? No.
I don't think anybody was following me.
I swear on my life, Tobin, I had absolutely-- [ Gunshot ]
Slow down.
We go in by foot.
Head towards the square.
Move, move, move!
We're heading west. Holland Street. Move, move.
Excuse me, sir.
My name is Tobin Frost.
Linklater.
When?
Lock down the consulate.
Get me a team in the situation room in five minutes.
I want everything we got on Tobin Frost. [ Man ] Yes, ma'am.
Is it him? Yeah.
Whitford know? I'm on my way there now.
Sir, place your finger in there until I tell you to stop. [ Beeping ] Thank you.
So how long has he been playing in your backyard?
We're working to get you that answer right now.
- Meaning you don't know. - No, meaning we're looking into it.
The guy goes rogue. He spends nine years selling out the Agency to all takers.
To Russia, China, Iran, you name it.
Guy's just not gonna prance into an American consulate without good reason.
All right! Listen up.
Everybody off the phone.
Tobin Frost has just waltzed his way into a U.S. consulate in Cape Town, South Africa.
Now this man without question is one of the most notorious traitors that we've got.
Errington, call up his background profile.
[ Errington ] Tobin Frost was recruited into the Agency in 1984.
He tested off the charts in aptitude for psychological fieldwork.
His first assignment was in Lebanon in January 1985.
Three months later, he captured and flipped a high-ranking Hezbollah leader.
Over the next several years,
Frost successfully questioned and recruited many high-value individuals.
He became known as an expert manipulator of human assets,
and he literally rewrote Agency interrogation protocols.
Frost served in many active theaters, including Libya,
Frost served in many active theaters, including Libya, from 1995 to 1998, Jordan, '98 to 2000.
from 1995 to 1998, Jordan, '98 to 2000.
During his tenure in Jordan, Frost was suspected of leaking information to Mossad,
but nothing was confirmed.
Ten years ago, Frost went off the reservation completely.
He currently has no allegiancs and is wanted for espionage on four continents.
His last known sighting is Hamburg, Germany in 2011.
You know, Harlan, we should interrogate Frost now.
Sweat him for everything he's got.
Once he's stateside, we have fewer options.
I have an interrogator in Yemen. Can be there in eight hours.
I already have a team in Jo'burg that can be there in two.
We'll take Frost to the safe house, interrogate him there.
My people are fully capable of handling this.
This is Tobin Frost.
We'll go with Jo'burg.
Okay.
You must turn around. [ Ball Thuds, Bounces ]
Help. Help.
[ Phone Rings ] Accident. L'accident.
Housekeeping.
[ Man ] We have a last-minute reservation.
E.T.A. for check-in? Sometime tonight.
E.T.A. for check-in? Sometime tonight. Freeark Insurance. Got it.
Freeark Insurance. Got it.
[ Woman ] Hello? Hey. Hey, where are you?
Hey, where are you?
Parker just handed me his oversight papers to finis.
And his daughter Chloe's got the measles. You believe that?
How long you gonna be out for? I don't know. I don't know.
Okay. Well, look, I'm gonna dive into this,
and then, um, hopefully I can meet up with you later, okay?
Yeah, that sounds good. Hey. Hey.
I love you. I love you too.
Bye. Bye.
Extraction team is in the air, sir.
They should be on the ground within the hour.
I want that team in and out of the city in less than 12 hours.
- We're not even supposed to have a presence in Cape Town. - [ Man ] Yes, sir.
[ Whitford ] Any communication about Frost's whereabouts...
[ Whitford ] Any communication about Frost's whereabouts... is strictly need to know.
Sir, the extraction team's en route to the consulate now.
- Who's reaching out to seven-R? - Richards, ma'am.
I want the housekeeper briefed.
High-priority target is coming in. I want the house quiet.
Under no circumstances should there be any communication until the team has left.
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah?
Account? You have a room?
Daniel Kiefer, Freeark Insurance. K-I-E-F-E-R.
[ Phone Beeps ] Kiefer. Freeark Insurance. K-I-E-F-E-R.
- [ Man ] You are a go. - [ Dial Tone ]
You're good to go.
Hey, I'm Weston. Guest room?
Uh, it's right around the corner. Two rights and a left.
All the way back.
That's Tobin Frost. [ Kiefer ] Stay with him.
That's Tobin Frost. [ Kiefer ] Stay with him. Let's go download our gear. Yes, sir.
Let's go download our gear. Yes, sir.
- Linen closet? - Down the hall. Just right at the end there.
Kill all the surveillance cameras in this room.
My name is Daniel Kiefer.
We were at the Farm together.
Technically, you were a year ahead.
I'm here to make you aware of your rights.
You're being held under a national security directive...
which means you have none, but you know that.
600s.
Towels. You need 600s.
Those are... 350, 375 gram weight.
You're gonna need 600s.
[ Kiefer ] I want to know the reasons for you being in Cape Town.
I want you to name your resources,
contacts, assets, everybody you've done business with, traded intel with,
contacts, assets, everybody you've done business with, traded intel with, sold secrets to in the nine years since you betrayed your country.
sold secrets to in the nine years since you betrayed your country.
Absolutely. Anything you want, Daniel.
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed lasted 20 seconds.
They had 600s.
Is this legal?
[ Kiefer ] Bring him down.
Bring him up.
How long was that? [ Panting ]
All right. Take him down.
Bring him up!
Get me a knife.
Miller.
Get in there with Frost.
- Sir, all the security cameras are down. - Reboot.
I wanna see what's out there. Copy that.
[ Loud Clang ] Let's go, boys!
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Let's go! Move!
Velez, take this corner.
Ericksson, get the back elevator.
Pope, what do you got?
Sir, I see approximately 12 heavily armed men in perimeter two.
[ Kiefer ] Okay, gents! Work four to add.
Two-by-two. Perimeter two.
Greer! Sir!
- [ Kiefer ] Ericksson! - Yes, sir!
[ Kiefer ] Velez!
Velez!
I'm good!
Let's go, fellas.
- [ Greer ] Incoming! - [ Kiefer ] Grenade! Oh, God!
- [ Groans ] - Greer!
[ Kiefer ] Start working back!
Velez, three-round bursts!
Velez, where's Greer? He's over there, sir.
Go, son.
This ain't a test. This is the real thing.
What are you gonna do?
You don't wanna try me.
[ Kiefer ] Magazine! Let's go.
Velez! Stay there!
Listen to me! Stay there!
Son of a bitch!
[ Machine Gun Fire ] Miller!
Hey! Get in here!
[ Machine Gun Fire ] Hey. Hey. Take these. Go watch him.
Hey. Take these. Go watch him.
Hey. They're here for me, but they want me alive. You, they'll kill.
They're here for me, but they want me alive. You, they'll kill.
You got one in the chamber?
It's okay. I remember my first posting.
It's okay. I remember my first posting. Rio de Janeiro. House like this.
Rio de Janeiro. House like this. Beautiful women. Not one single visitor. But I remember rule number one.
Beautiful women. Not one single visitor. But I remember rule number one.
You are responsible for your houseguest. I'm your houseguest.
The clock is ticking. They gave you the keys.
Do your duty, son.
Shut up. Let me think.
You wanna be the guy that lost Tobin Frost?
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.
Where's Frost?
We're leaving.
Where is he?
Stay here! Stay here! Wait! Don't move!
[ Chattering, Screaming ] [ Weston ] Go!
Get in the trunk.
You're serious? Yeah. Get in.
- The trunk? - Get in the trunk, now!
[ Yells ] No!
[ Line Ringing ] [ Man ] Ops Center.
- Echo Three Victor Echo Nine. - Go ahead.
This is Weston. Seven-R's been hit. Everyone's dead.
I need you to repeat that, please. Say again.
Kiefer, his team, everyone, they're all dead.
Stand by.
- Transferring. - [ Line Ringing ]
- [ Richards ] It's the house. - [ Man ] Off-line. Protocol two.
Linklater. This is Weston.
The safe house has been breached.
What's your location?
Um, I'm eastbound on Albert Road.
I'm just passing Woodstock.
I want eyes on this. Real-time sat feed.
[ Linklater ] And what's the location of the guest?
[ Weston ] We escaped.
- Clarify. Do you have the guest? - Yes! We escaped!
Look, I can make it to the consulate.
There's no chance for S.D.R. I think I might have picked up a tail.
We can't have a gun battle in front of the consulate.
Diplomatic catastrophe.
Where's that satellite feed?
Denied by National Recon. War theater use only.
Buy us some time.
Do not go to the consulate.
Follow protocol Alpha Zero.
Secure the guest and stay off the grid.
Reconnect at 1800 hours.
I repeat: Stay off the grid.
Copy. Copy. Copy.
All right. Cape Town police have responded to the house.
- Confirmed. - [ Linklater ] I want the site secured.
- [ Richards ] I'm hearing nine dead. - Initiating damage control.
[ Man ] I'm on it. Reaching out to N.I.A. now.
The locals are gonna have that house locked off.
Check all the traffic cameras, police reports.
Find out why Frost wanted to go into that consulate to begin with...
and who in the hell else might be after him.
We need to get Weston and Frost out of South Africa.
Do we have any tactical teams? Anything in play?
Yeah, I have assets in Egypt, but they're in deep.
If I pull them out, that would compromise two years' worth of work.
I can scramble a team from Europe or Asia, but it's gonna take at least 18 hours.
At this point, Weston is all we got.
I need to find out who this Matt Weston is right now.
[ Woman ] Matthew James Weston.
Born 2/24/82...
to Terry and Madeline Weston, Port Washington, New York.
An assault arrest one month after both parents and a younger sister...
were killed in a traffic accident...
in which his father's blood alcohol was twice the legal limit.
Yale. Degree in economics. Recruited out of Yale Law.
High marks in analytical and linguistics at the Farm,
excellent in tradecraft skills.
His girlfriend, Ana Moreau, is a French national.
Out. Get out. He reported them as having "close and continuing contact"
She's a second-year resident in the oncology department at Groote Schuur.
Get in that car.
Get in that car. She accepted a position with Hôtel-Dieu Hospital in Paris. Starts in two weeks.
She accepted a position with Hôtel-Dieu Hospital in Paris. Starts in two weeks.
No known political affiliations. She's clean.
I want you to post a car outside their apartment. Use back channels.
And get N.S.A. to cross-check their telephone records and their e-mails, please.
Yes, ma'am.
You know, it'd be easier if I knew where we were going.
You just drive, all right? Just drive. Middle lane.
All right.
Hey, what are you doing? Middle lane.
- Just drive around. - All right. I'm driving.
Nice to know who you're talking to. What's your name?
You crushed my windpipe.
Well, you locked me in the trunk.
Come on. You're not N.O.C. You're here under your real name. What is it?
You're here under your real name. What is it?
Weston, Matt. Oh, all right.
How long you been a safe house keeper?
Twelve months. Happy birthday.
Cape Town, that's low-level detail.
You should've been out of here by now.
Maybe I requested the assignment.
[ Chuckles ] Or maybe Langley doesn't trust you with anything else.
So, what's your plan?
Oh, let me guess. Follow protocol.
Protocol states that if your house is crashed,
you do an S.D.R. to make sure no one's following you,
activate your G.P.S. in your go bag, select another safe house.
You think I'm gonna let you just take me in?
I think you need to shut up. [ Chuckles ]
I think you need to consider how your house was attacked in the first place.
Have you done that, Matt?
They followed Kiefer. They followed him from the consulate.
And that's how they found the safe house. You don't really believe that.
How did they know I was near the consulate in the first place?
But I like this, you know-- you and me figuring shit out. Like, uh, the Hardy Boys.
Like, uh, the Hardy Boys.
That house was a secure location.
Whoever crashed it didn't stop by a gas station...
and ask for directions to the nearest safe house.
They were invited. Someone told them, Matthew. Think about it.
They were invited. Someone told them, Matthew. Think about it. Someone you know. So you better ask yourself: Can you trust your landlord?
Someone you know. So you better ask yourself: Can you trust your landlord?
Go ahead. You're not gonna get in my head. I already am in your head.
Go ahead. You're not gonna get in my head. I already am in your head. They're gonna isolate you, Matt. They're gonna be real nice to you at first.
They're gonna isolate you, Matt. They're gonna be real nice to you at first.
They're gonna put their arm around you...
and tell you things like, "You did a decent job, son.
and tell you things like, "You did a decent job, son. We'll take it from here." That's when you know you're screwed.
We'll take it from here." That's when you know you're screwed.
Forget about me. They're gonna focus on you.
They're gonna try and make a connection between you and I,
so that if this all goes wrong,
they'll have something to fall back on in their little Senate hearings.
I'm not your only enemy tonight.
[ Whitford ] So it's someone in-house.
It's the only way this thing could've happened.
We were completely buttoned up.
I want a list of everyone who knew about this.
Backgrounds, affiliations, particularly any connections with Frost.
Every movement, right up until this operation.
Your extraction team, how long had they been together?
My team had been together six months. Why?
Well, I'm just trying to get my head around this.
That'll do. Thank you.
[ Ana ] Hello. Hey.
Baby, where are you?
I'm all right. I'm okay. I'm okay.
I'm sorry I didn't call you back. I saw your missed calls.
You must be worried sick. Is everything okay?
I'm good. I'm good. Listen. Um--
This sounds so crazy.
We had some threats against the clinic last night,
so Parker and I, we stayed all night trying to get to the bottom of it.
so Parker and I, we stayed all night trying to get to the bottom of it. And, uh-- And, uh--
I'm sorry that I didn't call you back. I should have right away.
I was so worried. I know.
Can you do me a favor? Can you go over to the window for a second?
Why?
Can you just take a-- Just take a quick look out the window.
I want you to see if there's anyone out there. Any, uh--
Are there any cars that don't belong, anything?
Anyone hanging around out front?
There's a police car.
What's going on? I'm sorry about this.
I know this is a lot,
but they felt like it would be best if we didn't go home as a precaution.
I agree with them. There's nothing to worry about, but I agree with them.
I think you should just go to Dena's for a little while, just for a few hours.
I think you should just go to Dena's for a little while, just for a few hours. I'll call you in a little bit, and we'll, you know-- we'll--
we'll get together, okay?
Okay, I'll go.
[ Weston ] Okay. All right. I love you. I'll talk to you soon, all right? Don't worry, okay?
I'll talk to you soon, all right? Don't worry, okay? Okay, bye.
She know what you do for a living?
The girl on the phone. It was a girl, wasn't it?
Maybe it was a guy, I don't know.
I don't judge.
You can't expect to have a real relationship in our line of work, Matthew.
Don't worry. She's not gonna leave you.
See, what happens is you try to protect her with lies,
and then it starts to add up.
At the safe house, you said that they'd kill me to get to you.
- After a while, even the truth starts to sound like a lie. - Why?
You have something. You got something that they want.
What is it? A local girl?
- Don't worry about her. - Oh, it is a girl.
You'll keep covering your tracks. She'll keep believing, because she wants to, because she needs to.
She'll keep believing, because she wants to, because she needs to.
That's why we exist, you and me. That's our job.
To take advantage of that--
people's desire to believe.
To trust.
She's not gonna leave you, Matthew.
You're gonna leave her.
I'm not you.
[ Man ] Correct, sir. We verified it.
He's your boy. You take it.
[ Man ] Everybody stand by.
- [ Ringing Stops ] - Matty, it's me.
How you holding up?
I'm all right. [ Female Radio Dispatcher ] Copy that. Stand by.
Matt, we can't get another team in for at least 12 hours.
Sorry.
We've cleared a new safe house for you outside the city.
There's a go bag located at locker number 256,
There's a go bag located at locker number 256, Green Point Stadium, Metrorail station.
The combination: 2-5-1-22.
Now, the bag's got a G.P.S. in it.
It'll direct you to the safe house.
But you gotta be careful. It's an active location.
So approach with caution.
Matt?
Do you know how they found Frost? You know who led them to us?
We're working on that.
We're counting on you, Matt.
Get Frost to that safe house and you can write your own ticket.
I will.
I will.
Left at the light.
To the stadium?
Yeah.
[ Weston ] Hey, scarf. How much for the scarf?
[ Man ] Fifty rand, sir.
[ Weston ] Thanks.
Cuff your hands together. Together?
Yeah.
Out.
Are you sure you don't wanna just walk away from this?
Can't do that. Yes, you can. You should.
Move. Go. Across the street.
Going to the game. I like games.
Metrorail, straight ahead. Straight ahead.
Right over there.
Let's go.
- Help! Help! Help! He's trying to kidnap me! - [ Weston ] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- He's trying to kidnap me! Help! Help! - [ Shouting In Afrikaans ]
- He's got a gun! - I'm undercover. I'm a policeman.
- He's got a gun! - I'm undercover. I'm a policeman. [ Speaking Afrikaans ] Help!
He's got a gun! He's got a gun right there! He's got a gun! He's got a gun!
I'm undercover. No. I'm undercover.
- I'm undercover. - If you calm down, sir. Everybody calm down! Just calm down!
[ Groans ] Get down! Get down!
Okay! All right! Okay! Okay!
Get up! Get him up! Get up! - [ Frost ] Ow! Ow! Ow! - Wait! Wait!
All right. I'm just-- I'm an American citizen.
I don't know what he-- what he-- what he--
Calm down, all right? Just calm down.
You don't understand. that man is extremely dangerous.
Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm a police officer. I'm from America.
I arrested this man. His name is Tobin Frost. Where did you take him?
He's in the infirmary.
There! There! There! Is that it? Top left!
There! There! There! Is that it? Top left! Second screen from the top. Look. Look. The infirmary.
Second screen from the top. Look. Look. The infirmary.
All right. Go back.
Third-tier infirmary now! Move!
Third-tier infirmary. Go now!
You see?
[ Gun Cocks ] Don't move.
Suspect now spotted, on the southwest upper deck.
on the southwest upper deck.
Suspect sighted passing yellow block 228.
Frost!
Stop! Stop!
- Get out of the way! - Stop!
Stop! [ Screaming ]
No! Stop!
Medic!
Drop the gun.
Drop it.
I'm responsible for you.
You're responsible for yourself.
Get on your knees.
You gonna kill me?
I only kill professionals.
7:53 PM, FRIDAY [ Man On Police Radio ] Height, approximately six fee.
Anglo, wearing a stadium security jacket.
The suspect was last seen entering Green Point Stadium Metrorail, stadium concourse.
Sir, we have a thread on what Frost might be doing in Cape Town.
- Uh, can you-- Can you bring up-- - Yeah.
Alec Wade. Fifteen-year NOC at MI6.
Sabotage, counter-ambush, counter-I.E.D. tactics,
until he blew up an op in Lisbon four years ago and was put on a desk, pushing papers.
Cape Town police found him shot through the head.
High-powered rifle. Fourteen blocks from the consulate.
Witnesses placed someone fitting Frost's description...
in the car at the time of the shooting.
And we think what? That they were working together?
Well, they ran joint operations in Hamburg, mid-'80s.
Frost's last sighting was in Hamburg, 2011.
And what are the Brits saying about Wade?
Hmm, officially they're saying nothing.
Unofficially?
He's been the subject of a five-month internal investigation.
They think he's been trading intel. Hmm.
So what the hell did Wade leak to Frost...
that was so important it was worth killing six of our men?
I want more details from MI6.
- Call in every chit you got. - Yes, sir.
And, David, I want an internal investigation of Daniel Kiefer and his team.
- I've got Weston calling in for David Barlow. - [ Man ] Everyone, stand by.
[ Weston On Phone ] I lost him. [ Barlow ] Frost?
[ Weston ] Yeah, he's gone.
After I picked up the G.P.S., he created a diversion,
took out a couple of cops at the stadium.
- [ Barlow ] Any idea where's he's headed? - Not exactly, but I will.
This is Linklater. You said he took out two cops?
Matt, you're on speaker.
Yes, ma'am. At the Green Point Stadium.
[ Woman On TV, Distorted ] ...involvement in a possible kidnapping.
The suspect is being described as a white male of medium build--
Stadium police is reporting you shot a cop.
[ Weston ] I returned fire in self-defense.
Look. The fact of the matter is Frost is on the loose.
I've spent the last 14 hours with him.
He might have said or done something that could lead me to him.
You are to stand down, proceed to the consulate,
and present yourself for exfil and debrief. Acknowledge.
By the time I'm debriefed, Frost will be gone.
I've spent 12 months researching every square inch of this town.
I will find Frost, and I'll deliver him.
Weston, this is Harlan Whitford, son.
Now you've done a fine job, but we'll take it from here.
Understood.
[ Ana ] Hello?
Sir, I respectfully request that that exchange not make it onto his files.
He's either incompetent, or he's working with somebody else.
Do not make this about Weston.
David-- It was your guys that lost Frost.
It was your team folded at the safe house.
I want both of you on an airplane to Cape Town.
Frost is trying to get out of the country. Go find his ass.
[ Whispers ] There you go, baby.
One ticket to Jo'burg.
Thank you.
[ Woman On TV ] Police have detained American N.G.O. worker Matthew Weston..
[ Woman On TV ] Police have detained American N.G.O. worker Matthew Weston.. as a possible suspect in the shooting.
as a possible suspect in the shooting.
Weston had been detained earlier today,
but had managed to escape while being questioned by police--
The suspect has been described as a white male of medium build,
possibly wearing a stadium security outfit.
Baby.
Are you all right?
I lied to you.
About everything. The N.G.O., Parker,
my job,
my family.
So who do you work for?
The government.
C.I.A.
No, no. I don't--
I don't do anything. I sit-- I--
I don't do anything. I sit-- I-- I sit around in an apartment all day. I answer the phone.
I need you to leave.
I need you to do that for me. Okay?
Here.
This is a ticket to Jo'burg.
When you get there, you go straight to the airport.
There's a 6:00 a.m. flight to Paris.
Take this.
You take this. If anyone stops you--
If anyone stops you-- If anybody stops you--
Who do you think I am?
Stop! Stop! Fuck you!
Hey. Stop.
Hey. Stop. Stop it.
We broke up a week ago. You haven't seen me since, okay?
I'm sorry.
Just leave. Please?
- Do you love me? - Very much.
Go. Go.
Go.
[ Woman On P.A. ] Attention, all passengers,
platform 20 for Langa Township,
departing in five minutes.
Langa Township, departing in five minutes.
Sir, someone just logged into our system... using Weston's password, accessing his stored files.
using Weston's password, accessing his stored files.
It's him. What the hell's he doing?
I want to see what he's looking at.
[ Richards ] He's pulled an old report on surveillance targets...
[ Richards ] He's pulled an old report on surveillance targets... living in the Langa Township area.
It's a profile of Carlos Villar, a Nicaraguan national.
He's a known document forger.
- [ Whitford ] Get me a copy of Weston's report. - [ Richards ] Yes, sir.
Oh, shit. Logged off, sir. He's gone.
An Internet café on Long Street.
- The black Dorian Gray. - That's right.
How you doing, brother? [ Chuckles ]
Come in. Yes, sir.
Illana.
[ Illana ] Hi. We have a guest.
Illana. Good to meet you. Joseph. My daughter.
How are you? Hello.
My son-in-law.
- [ Chuckles ] - [ Illana ] May I offer you some tea?
Uh, no. We're going upstairs.
I remembered.
You even let it breathe.
"Too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart.
O when may it suffice?
That is heaven's part."
In the old days, a cheap bottle of Flor de Caña kept us happy all night.
Mmm. Tastes change.
People change.
People don't change.
We grow old.
And some of us adapt...
and learn how to enjoy simple pleasures of life,
like a family, a home.
And for you,
what's in that glass right now, for you,
is as good as it's ever gonna be.
One day you'll understand...
you got more past than future.
You'll learn.
What is this? An intervention?
I thought you were dead.
So, what brings you to my home in the middle of the night after all these years?
[ Woman ] Papa?
Uh-huh? We're going.
Okay, be careful. Okay, Papa.
What are you gonna do with this?
Gonna make some money.
Let me borrow your glasses.
That's it. Listen.
I'm gonna need a new passport,
photo I.D., driver's license, the whole shebang.
photo I.D., driver's license, the whole shebang. Can you do that for me?
Yeah.
You sure?
Yes.
Weston never showed at the consulate.
And he was just accessing our secure server,
searching for someone to create an alias package.
He's trying to leave the country.
Or he's going after Frost.
[ Linklater ] Look at what happened at the soccer stadium.
This guy let Frost escape.
I think Weston's turned.
I know this boy.
He's been looking for a chance to prove himself.
He's trying to bring in Frost.
Come on, David. You're not seeing the evidence.
[ Clears Throat ] Not my best work,
but given the pressure of time, it's passable.
It's good. I'll wire you the money as soon as I get out of town.
Tobin, don't do this. It's different.
You don't need the trouble. You don't need the money.
- You can give it-- - [ Gunshot ]
- [ Illana ] Carlos! - Illana!
Carlos! [ Screams ] Illana!
Carlos!
Carlos.
Carlos!
Go.
Vete. Go.
- He's on the roof! - [ Machine Gun Fire ]
Go! Go!
Get in the car!
They think they can come at me like this.
Have to do a whole lot better than that.
Shit!
Yeah, Matt, how'd you find me?
It wasn't that hard.
Let's go.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Who do you work for? [ Groans ] Huh?
Who sent you? Who sent you?
[ Man Groaning ] Who?
Vargas. Huh?
Vargas. Huh? Vargas.
Who's Vargas? Who's Vargas? Huh?
You wanna die? Huh?
Who's Vargas? [ Gun Cocks ]
Matt.
C.I.A.
C.I.A.! C.I.A.!
6:17 AM, SATURDAY Report?
There was a shoot-out in the Langa Township.
Two crime scenes. One at the residence of Carlos Villar.
He's a document forger. The other, a nearby tenement.
And where was Frost last seen? Tenement.
Have fun at Villar's.
We'll meet up later.
You were right about Ana.
That's her name.
[ Frost ] Sorry to hear that.
Most case officers get married three, four times.
You?
Once.
You're falling apart over here.
Don't kill innocent people, Matthew.
What?
Air traffic controller. Tiny airstrip in Bermuda.
George Edwart Cox. I remember that name.
Edwart, with a "T."
My inside officer said, uh, he was organizing arms shipments,
but he was just an air traffic controller.
He was just a guy.
I put a bullet in his skull.
Black ops came in, they replaced him with one of their own,
crashed a Gulfstream in the ocean that night.
Thing was, the family that was on the plane--
husband-- he was a whistle-blower.
Whole thing was about...
stopping him from testifying about wet works...
to a congressional hearing.
That's why you left. No.
I went back to work the next day like nothing ever happened.
You practice anything a long time, you get good at it.
You tell a hundred lies a day, it sounds like the truth.
Everyone betrays everyone.
That's a shitty excuse.
Yeah, I used to be innocent like you.
Wrap myself up in the flag.
I'm gonna take you in.
Good for you.
- Barlow. - [ Linklater ] So, witnesses identified a pair of men...
fitting Weston and Frost's description leaving this location together.
- So he pulled it off. - Weston is aiding and abetting a fugitive.
[ Barlow ] You're wrong.
If he's with Frost, he's taking him to the safe house.
[ Watch Beeps ] That's where we gotta be.
Fine. Fine.
Meet me at the crossroads at Old Malmesbury Road.
Who are you?
You Weston?
Give me the shotgun.
What the hell is this? Who are you?
I'm Keller. Safe house keeper.
Authorization index: Bravo Four Seven Oscar Whiskey Six.
Inside. Let's go.
Left.
Slowly.
I don't know who trained you, man, but this sure as hell ain't protocol.
Where's the guest room?
Well, that's the thing. We don't really have one.
In there. In there.
Cuff him. To the pipe.
Out. Over there.
All right.
Control room.
Whatever you say, man. It's your rodeo.
Call it in. Let me hear it.
[ Man ] Landlord. My guest is here.
Account? Abaresque Limited.
With a guest? Yeah, package delivered.
Confirmed. Pickup scheduled.
All right. They're on the way.
Can we at least put the gun down now?
Thanks, Clayton. Bye.
It's a microchip.
What?
That was my guy from MI6. Wade got his hands on a microchip.
And what was on it? Only Wade knew.
But I think it's safe to assume that's why he hooked up with Frost-- to sell it.
Let's get moving.
Long day, huh?
Yeah. I can only imagine. With Tobin Frost.
That man's a legend.
I hope you picked up something. I mean, you ain't gonna find a better education.
You know, this is the most excitement I've seen.
You're the first guest I've had in 10 months.
[ Chuckles ] But you wouldn't know anything about that now, right?
You got a city posting.
Yeah, nightlife, beaches,
little ladies running around everywhere.
Yeah.
I'm jealous.
You got coffee?
Yeah, yeah. It's in the cupboard. Where?
Want me to go get it? I got it.
Why are-- Why are you in Cape Town?
You tell me now. Why?
What is-- What is it?
Dirt list, laundry list.
Israeli Intelligence, five years ago,
compiled blackmail intel.
Corrupt agents, German intelligence, MI6.
C.I.A.? Yes. [ Grunts ]
Yes. [ Grunts ]
We gotta get away.
We-- We gotta get outta here.
Ah, shit.
Don't-- Don't, don't, don't.
Don't. No. Don't-- Don't leave me here, please.
Don't-- Don't do it, please. Please.
Matt?
How you doing?
I'm proud of you.
And what you pulled off.
You're gonna make a hell of a case officer.
Where's Frost?
Ah, he's gone.
Place is a wreck. And blood everywhere.
Was he injured or--
I guess you know he killed Keller.
No.
I killed Keller.
Frost killed Keller.
He killed Linklater too.
Did he talk about anything? Any-- Anything he was after?
Anything he might have had?
File.
A file?
The file that you're on.
Along with a lot of other people. Important people.
Listen to me. What would you do...
if someone is watching your every move--
some maybe you're not proud of,
and you will have some you're not proud of, believe me--
and then tries to use it against you?
You'd do what you have to do.
You'd do what you have to do.
Where's the file?
Matt, the file. Where is the file?
You're a dead man.
Yeah. A long time now.
Frost is here.
Let's go.
We got him.
A hell of a job.
You smell that, huh?
That Pinotage is a good grape. Great wine, yeah.
Local grape, Pinotage. Great--
[ Whispers ] I don't want you losing this one.
This is worth a lot of money.
You-- You're a good boy, Matty. You-You--
You know what you are?
I know what you're not.
You're better than me.
No, it's okay. Just... be better than me.
You promise me.
Yeah.
Well, let's-let's-let's-let's--
Let's-- Let's go.
I just gotta get up. I need to get up. [ Grunts ] No, just--
[ Grunts ] Stay. Yeah, yeah.
That's, uh, exactly as it happened.
Well, obviously this situation needs to be handled with a certain amount of finesse.
Has anybody else seen this report?
No, sir. Not yet.
Matt, I'm sure this comes as no surprise,
but parts of this report are gonna have to be altered for national security.
Which parts, sir? Well,
Which parts, sir? Well, David Barlow can't be held responsible for what happened to the safe house.
David Barlow can't be held responsible for what happened to the safe house.
We just don't need the scandal.
But, sir, you and I both know that that's just not the truth.
People don't want the truth anymore, Matt.
It's too messy. Keeps them up nights.
I tell you what I am willing to do though.
I think the Agency has grossly underestimated you,
and I'm recommending you for a senior case officer position.
Provided you still want it.
That's a generous offer, sir.
There's just one thing you need to clarify for me.
Of course.
Frost may have been carrying some vital intel.
A file.
I'm not seeing that anywhere in this report.
What was on the file, sir?
Something that, quite frankly, could be very damaging to the Agency and to our allies.
I don't see why Frost would even mention something like that to me.
No, I suppose he wouldn't, would he?
You realize though that if that file did leak,
what would happen to the person responsible.
That person would be arrested, sir.
He'd be risking everything.
He'd have enemies in every intelligence agency in the world.
In the eyes of the C.I.A., he'd be just like Tobin Frost.
Frost didn't say anything about a file, sir.
All right, son.
Take a few days off.
We'll get you started next week.
Thank you.
And, uh, think about our conversation, would you?
Will do.
I'll take it from here, sir.
[ Man On TV ] Media outlets received a controversial file from an anonymous source.
The international intelligence community is still reeling...
from the release of so many highly classified documents...
and the revelations of widespread corruption...
and criminal activity at the C.I.A., the B.N.D.--
[ Man #2 ] ...is in an uproar over the lack of oversight given to British Intelligence,
demanding accountability of the rogue agents.
Officials at MI6 are fully cooperating--
[ Man #3 ] Chancellor Merkel insists that the B.N.D.... has already identified the corrupt agents and contained the intelligence breach.
She has ensured her international counterparts--
[ Man #4 ] ...indictments are now expected within the week, and that Congress...
has demanded that Deputy Director Harlan Whitford...
testify before a Senate subcommittee,
Check, charge or cash?
Cash.
And make it out to Jack's Demolition, Tucson.
Seven eighty-eight thirty.
Okay.
Hey.
Taking me to breakfast?
I can't, I'm meeting Bosko.
Hey, Vincent.
-Mom, where are my barrettes? -Hi, sweetie.
-I saw them on the kitchen table. -They're not there. I already checked.
-Want me to make coffee? -No school today?
My dad's taking me to the new building and then to lunch.
Try under the cushions on the sofa.
He's already a half an hour late.
He gonna show? Or that son of a bitch gonna stand her up like last time?
-I'll make coffee. -I'm out of time, babe.
Mom, where are my barrettes? They're not in the couch.
Wear the blue ones.
I don't wanna wear the blue ones. They don't match.
-Did you check in your bathroom? -I checked everywhere.
-Well, what do you want me to do? -Find them.
-Mom, pay attention. -All right, sweetie, all right. What?
-Daddy's gonna be here. -Okay, he's gonna--
I'm not gonna be ready. I can't be late.
-You won't be late. -No, I will be late.
Okay. Before Daddy comes, we can find them if we look together.
-It's all right, baby. It's all right. -No.
It's all right. It's all right.
We'll find them together, you and me. We'll find them together.
Just relax. He won't come before we find them. I promise you.
Hey. Give me another refill.
Now he wants a refill.
-What's your name? -Waingro.
You're Michael, huh?
You guys always work together?
All the time.
-Real tight crew, huh? -Real tight.
Yeah, if this works good, I'd consider going again, you know.
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?
-How's he doing? -A hundred percent.
Right on schedule.
Made a right on Venice Boulevard.
-We're a mile and a half from you. -Okay.
Just crossed over the number-one lane, 300 yards from you now.
-Get set. -I am.
Put that on.
Here we go.
Two eleven! Two eleven! We're being held up!
-Two-eleven alarm. Armored car. -There's the call.
Three minutes.
Clear!
Eighty seconds left!
Get back. Get back. Get back!
Hey, Slick, you see that shit coming out of their ears?
They can't fucking hear you. Cool it.
I got it. Got it.
You had to fuck with me. You wanna fuck with me?
Come on! What the fuck are you doing? What did you do?
Come on! What the fuck are you doing? What did you do? -I had to, man. Guy was making a move. -Let's go.
Dumb motherfucker.
-Step back, please, sir. -I heard them.
A million six.
Forty cents on the dollar, 640,000 to you.
Here's a 150 front money.
Get you the rest in two, three days.
Know who owned these?
"Malibu Equity and Investments."
Roger Van Zant. Owns banks in the Caymans.
Runs investment portfolios for offshore drug money. Stuff like that.
-So? -So you ripped off his bearer bonds.
He's got insurance.
That's the point. He collects 100 percent from the insurance.
He's a player. Maybe he buys his bonds back from us for 60 percent of their value.
He's a player. Maybe he buys his bonds back from us for 60 percent of their value. And make 40 percent on top of the 100 percent.
Sell it back to him instead of going to the street. That's an extra 320,000 to you.
Try it on him.
-Kelso called. -About what?
A score he's putting out and wants you to look at.
What do I need his score for? I got my own.
Says it's clean and low eight figures.
-Nine a.m. tomorrow. -What happened out there?
Don't ask.
Find the ambulance?
-Dumped it four blocks from here. -22nd Street between Figueroa and Flower.
They torched it. Burned everything. The guns, clothes, everything.
They were airborne. Taped the last few seconds... ...of the black-and-whites doing demolition derby.
Stolen out of Fresno two weeks ago.
Yellow pickup truck out of Whittier day before yesterday.
You taking this one, lieutenant, or does it stay in Division?
This look like gangbangers working the local 7-Eleven to you?
-Robbery-Homicide's taking it. Yeah. -All yours.
We got three motorists. All they saw were men with masks. They were distant.
Console TV man over there however, he was closer.
He ID anybody?
Well, he was hiding. He heard it mostly.
Okay. What about them?
Right. Now, according to TV man, this guy started mouthing off.
-Smart. -Yeah, somebody called a guard "Slick."
-Slick? -Yeah.
Now, this guy-- I figure this guy went for that holdout piece, ankle holster, right?
From here.
To his side.
This guy here has got what appears to be a double-tap entry wound to the sternum.
Tattooing around the head wound, scorched bone, close range.
Probably executed.
And it was a million six in bearer bonds, and they ignored the loose cash.
Because they had no time, because they were on a clock.
Which means they knew our response time to a 211...
...had our air, immobilized it, entered...
...escaped in under three minutes.
It's a good spot here. We got good escape routes.
-Two freeways within a quarter of a mile. -Traffic video camera?
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.
You recognize the M.O.?
M.O. is that they're good.
Once it escalated into a murder-one beef for all of them...
...after they killed the first two guards, they didn't hesitate...
...popped guard number three because what difference does it make?
Why leave a living witness?
Drop of a hat, these guys will rock 'n' roll.
The shape charge.
The shape charge indicates that they are technically proficient.
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.
So let's start looking for recent high-line burglaries that have mystified us.
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI.
You're gonna get the phone book. Do it anyway.
Who's moving the bearer bonds?
Check the usual fences. You and I will check Cusamano and Torena.
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro. Hang in with Forensics.
From the bomb squad, I want the explosive.
If we're lucky, it's exotic. We can trace the sale.
Get your hand out of that man's pocket, Rachel.
Oh, Vince.
Want some pie?
Gotta go to the john.
Look, I had to get it on, man. He was making a move. I had to get it on.
Split's in the car. I took out of ours evenly...
...to make up for his full end.
Because I wanna pay off and get rid of this motherfucker right now.
Okay.
Hold it!
Hey.
-Where's the rest? -We're late.
You look too good to go out. I could just jump you right here.
-Where is it? -Squared the bookies, baby.
There's more in a couple days, so don't sweat it. We really are late.
Yeah, come on, you gotta be kidding me.
Honey, it ain't worth the risks you take for 8000.
Like in risk versus reward, baby.
Let's go. Get your coat.
There is no point talking to you. All you are is a child growing older.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means we're not making forward progress like real grown-up adults, living our lives.
I'm married to a gambling junkie who won't listen.
Charlene, get in the fucking car.
What am I doing in this rat-bastard situation?
You're not! What do you want from me? Leave the bankbook and car keys...
...in the kitchen on your way out. Are we going, or am I going alone?
You could keep that other crap but Dominick would go with me.
Don't you even think about--
Yeah. Tell me Albert Torena called back.
-Albert Torena call Vincent? -No.
No. Report came in.
The explosive was Dynex, linear-shaped charge used in demolition.
You can pick it up with a driver's license in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico.
-Too common to trace a sale, Vincent. -Oh, that's wonderful.
Are you all right?
What happened? Where you been?
Work.
Lauren's dad show up?
Didn't call, didn't show. We waited for you till 10:30.
Now, does this guy have any idea what's going on with his kid?
I don't know.
Fucking jerk.
Well, is she okay?
She's been in her room all day.
So no, she's not okay. Neither am I.
I made dinner for us, four hours ago.
Every time I try to maintain a consistent mood between us, you withdraw.
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk off Venice Boulevard, Justine.
I'm sorry...
...if the goddamn chicken...
...got overcooked.
-Did you find it? -Not yet.
There it is.
-Interior design? -It's on the back wall.
-Coffee, sir? -Please.
Will you pass the cream?
-Thanks. -What did you get?
What?
What are you reading?
Book about metals.
"Stress Fractures in Titanium."
What kind of work you do?
Lady, why are you so interested in what I read or what I do?
I've seen you in the store from time to time.
What store?
Hennessey + Ingalls. I work there.
If you don't wanna talk to me, it's okay. I'm sorry I bothered you.
I didn't mean to be rude. I didn't recognize you.
I work in metals. I'm a salesman. My name's Neil.
I'm Eady.
You like working there?
Sure. I get a discount and there's a whole section of books in my area.
What area's that?
Graphic design.
I do letterheads and logotypes at night...
...and the store's a day job till I get enough going.
Who do you do that for?
A restaurant.
I did their menus...
...and a small record label.
CDs. I've done two so far.
You go to school for that?
Yeah.
-Yeah, I went to Parsons. -Where's that?
New York City.
How long you been out here?
About a year.
You like it?
Not really. I'm mostly here for the work.
-Live in this neighborhood? -No, I live kind of above Sunset Plaza.
It's actually kind of-- It's a little house that I rent.
And it's just kind of run-down, but a beautiful, beautiful view.
What about you?
-I live up here. -That's very funny.
So where's your family from originally?
I'm Scotch-Irish.
They emigrated to Appalachia in the late 1700s.
Where are you from?
The Bay Area.
Are your folks there?
My mother died a long time ago, and my father, I don't know where he is.
Got a brother somewhere.
You have a tight family. I can tell.
-Yep. -Right?
You're right.
City of lights.
In Fiji, they have these iridescent algae. They come out once a year in the water.
That's what it looks like out there.
You been there?
No, I'm going there someday.
Oh, yeah?
You travel a lot?
-Yeah. -Traveling makes you lonely?
I'm alone. I am not lonely.
You?
I get lonely.
Albert!
-Shit. -Albert.
Vincent, what you doing coming here, man? You crazy? This ain't Disneyland.
You were supposed to get back to me last night, Albert. Where the fuck you been?
-I couldn't break free, Vincent. You know. -Let's violate his ass right now.
I do for you, you don't do for me, is that it?
Vincent, man, I swear, I was out all night, man.
I'm hitting like one of them flamingo-matador guys.
Flamingo? That's got nothing to do with me.
I was cutting it real smooth. I'm generating leads and shit for you.
-I'm a dancer, man. You know. -Bullshit.
I paged your ass all day. I can't stand paging.
You're a speed freak, jacking methamphetamine again.
Where is your empathy, brother? It's a substance-abuse problem.
Empathy was yesterday.
Today you're wasting my motherfucking time.
-Vincent, man, look-- -Did you fall in love?
Come on. Did you fall in love last night and you went off somewhere?
-Vincent-- -Just tell me that. I'll settle for it. -I'll buy that. -Vincent.
-I'll buy that. -Vincent.
Give me all you got!
-Vincent-- -Give me all you got!
I swear, man, my brother, man-- My brother Richard's gonna talk to you.
I heard "Richard"?
-He's gonna talk to you. -Richard? -Richard. -Richard.
-Richard. -Richard. -He's gonna meet you, I swear, tonight. -He's not here, is he?
-He's gonna meet you, I swear, tonight. -He's not here, is he?
-No, he's gonna meet you tonight. -Tonight? What happened to now?
I implored him because I knew you was coming this a.m.
-This is a bunch of bullshit. -No, no, I swear. He said no because he in Phoenix.
He said no because he in Phoenix.
But this, man, I swear-- I swear, man, tonight's the best I can do for you.
Tonight's the best I can do for you, man.
You know? He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado...
...at 2 a.m. Be there.
You be there too.
Vincent, I can't be there, man. I got things to do, Vincent.
-I got things to do, places to be. I got-- -Hey, hey, hey.
Be there.
Don't waste my motherfucking time!
What is it?
It's a bank.
It depos cash on Thursday for distribution to all the other branches...
...to cover Friday payroll checks.
So on Thursdays, the command branch has got a full whack.
-On the prowl or strong? -Strong. Through the front door.
How many guys?
Four, or three plus a driver. Walk in, knock them over, walk out.
And you want a 100,000 advance against a 10-percent cut for that?
Sounds like an address to a cowboy score. They hit the holdup alarms... ...I gotta get out before the cops show. What is that?
...I gotta get out before the cops show. What is that?
They hit three holdup alarm systems.
Two telco and a cellular.
See, but the signals aren't going anywhere because....
See, the night before, you cut in and trick out the alarm-system computer...
...to turn itself and the video recorders off 20 minutes before you walk in the door.
Architectural, electrical-engineering plans?
I got all that. Schematics, got the boards already built. They go straight into the CPU.
What's the estimate?
Twelve-point-one-, 12.2 million.
You're on.
Congratulations.
And to give you a little idea of where my estimates come from, this is a printout....
Nobody knew the merch was yours.
Be that as it may, my way you get 100 percent from the insurance company...
...and take the bonds from us at 60 cents on the dollar...
...and make yourself another 40 percent.
Your operation doesn't skip a beat. Everybody makes out.
Sure, you got a deal.
Good, because there's no percentage if everyone gets their underwear in a twist.
Yeah, so you have your man call me and we'll set the meet.
Yeah, okay.
Nice talking to you.
You gonna deal with these guys?
So word's on the street it's okay to steal my stuff.
I'm gonna kill the sons of bitches.
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets for Canary Islands' offshore.
That's not really an estimate. Those are exact figures.
I have a printout of the cash flow of the bank for the past two months.
-How'd you get this information? -Just comes to you.
This stuff just flies through the air.
They send information out and it's beamed out all over the place.
All you have to do is know how to grab it. See, I know how to grab it.
Okay, here we go. Thirteen-point-nine million.
-I bought it. -Good.
What did I tell you?
Here.
We're on. Call Van Zant, collect the money.
-How is he? -He's a businessman.
Okay.
-Avocado. -"Avocado."
-Hello? -Yeah, hello.
Chris is at my place.
-What's wrong? -Husband-and-wife stuff.
I'll let him sleep it off here.
What happened to you?
-When you gonna get some furniture? -When I get around to it.
Charlene's gonna leave me.
Why?
Not enough steaks in the freezer.
With everything we've been doing?
Vegas and the Super Bowl cleaned me out.
-When you gonna get an old lady? -When I get around to it.
You got something else on the side?
Nothing regular.
She got something else on the side?
-No. -You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
I don't know what you're doing.
Remember Jimmy MacAwain on the yard used to say:
"You wanna be making moves on the street?
Have no attachments. Allow nothing to be in your life...
...that you cannot walk out on in 30 seconds flat...
...if you spot the heat around the corner."
Remember that?
For me, the sun rises and sets with her, man.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Okay.
Today we take delivery of cash from Van Zant...
...then I drop our deposit on Kelso for this bank.
Bank? What bank?
What about the platinum thing? It's ready to fall.
That goes too, then the bank.
-You want some breakfast? -Yeah.
Are you okay?
Yeah, sugar.
Yeah. -For real. -Okay.
Gonna do good. I'll see you later.
You Solenko? I'm Don Breedan.
Grierson, my parole officer, told me to come by here and see if you had a job for me.
-You're familiar with this kind of operation? -Yeah, man. I'm a great grill man.
Good. Good for you. Here, you'll mop the toilets, hit the dishwasher...
...bus tables and empty the garbage too.
Give me a hard time, I'll report you loaded, drunk or stealing.
And I will violate you back so fast your head will spin.
Twenty-five percent of your take-home kicks back to me.
Rules of the game. Call Grierson, check it out.
Change in the back.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Malibu Equity and Investments.
-Yeah, Roger Van Zant. -Please hold.
-Yeah, this is Roger Van Zant. -I'm supposed to collect something.
Give me your number, and somebody will call you right back from a different line.
818-133-6089.
-Yep. -I got a package for you.
There's a drive-in on Centinela. Two-thirty tomorrow.
Okay, just send one man, alone.
-Who was that guy? -Nobody. Who the--? Who--? Who was that guy?
-He's nobody. -I gotta know who he is. Who is he?
-He's nobody, Neil. -Listen, you--
He's a legit liquor wholesaler from Las Vegas.
-Alan Marciano. -Chris is gonna straighten it up with you.
-It's too late. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it! -Shut up!
Here's the deal. You'll give Chris one last shot.
After that, he fucks up, then I will finance setting you up myself...
...on my own, anywhere you want.
Dominick will go with you. And my word counts.
But right now, you will give him the chance.
Clean up. Go home. Clean up. Go home.
Give me all your money.
One day you gonna get smoked with that shit.
Ain't gonna be you, fool.
-He's coming in alone. Send him through. -Yeah, got it.
Vincent, hey, man.
Vincent. This is my brother, Richard. Richard, Vincent.
-Richard. -Yo, it's all right.
What have you got for me?
Before we even get into that...
...there's this crew ripping rides all along the beach areas, all right?
Now, the back of a trim shop on Irvine...
...if somebody was to pay a little visit this weekend...
...they might find two Turbos and a 911 Slope.
You're looking to rid yourself of your competition.
I'm a good citizen.
I'm Donald Duck. So you got something to tell me or what?
Check this out, coz.
How do I know if I tell you what you need to know...
...you're gonna do what the fuck I need to get done?
Richard, man, Hanna is straight up, man. We do business all the time.
I ain't your coz, you rat motherfucker.
And you know because I say so after I hear what the fuck you gotta tell me.
Look here, man. You understand what I'm saying?
I can get killed for telling you this shit.
Or you're gonna get killed walking your doggie.
All right.
There's this cat I was locked up with in Folsom.
Did a couple, two, three years. He got out and I ran into him.
And so?
He's a big fiend for action.
Now, if he'd have said nothing, I'd have thought nothing...
...but he goes on and on, running down to me how he ain't been doing nothing...
...and nothing's been going on, and all this bullshit.
So right then and there I know this cat's got something going down.
Pretty fucking great.
Albert, what's wrong with you?
You drag me here, waste my time like this.
You saw a guy on the street who's an ex-con?
-That's right. -Well, I am over-fucking-whelmed.
What do you want for that, a Junior G-man badge?
You gonna make the call on them Porsches or what?
Is he kidding me?
-Vincent-- -I'm telling you, this Slick is no joke.
You know what I'm saying?
-Say what? Say what? -What?
-You said, "Slick." What does that mean? -Slick. That's what he calls people, "Slick."
And tell me about him.
About 6 feet tall, lot of jailhouse tats.
Got a big-ass peacock right here.
What's his name?
Cheritto.
Michael Cheritto.
Thirty-three busts since 1976. Eleven for armed robbery, three convictions.
Two out of a three-to-five-year beef in Attica. Three years in Marion.
Five years in Folsom off a knock-back to involuntary manslaughter.
-Jacket's 2 inches thick. -Okay.
-Who do I have there now? -Drucker and me, boss. And Schwartz.
Tell SIS I want full surveillance.
That's 24 hours. Round the clock, day and night.
We never close. Open seven days a week. Bug the car, the house, the work.
When he moves or sits, like in a restaurant...
...I want pictures of who he moves and sits with.
Then run makes on them. They got jackets, I wanna see who they move and sit with.
I want it up and running by tomorrow night.
-Put your hands where I can see them. -What?
-Put your hands where I can see them. -All right.
I tell you what to do, I tell you how to do it.
Now, with your right hand only, your right hand only...
...take the package and throw it in here.
Fuck. Behind you. On the right.
Yeah, Roger Van Zant?
-Yeah, who's this? -You know who this is.
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.
I sent a guy to deliver the package. He didn't call. Is everything right?
Tell you what, forget the money.
-What? -Forget the money.
It's a lot of money. What are you doing? What do you mean, "Forget the money"?
What am I doing? I'm talking to an empty telephone--
I don't understand.
--because there is a dead man on the other end of this fucking line.
Oh, my.
-Do you like it? -Look at my ring.
Did you know about this? It's so beautiful.
You are insane.
Do you like it?
-It's beautiful. -Yeah, it's pretty good.
-Just don't ask him where he got it. -Yeah, that's right.
What do you wanna be when you grow up, honey?
I don't know.
She doesn't know. Just like me. I don't know either.
Hello?
Hi, it's me.
Hey. I was wondering if you'd call.
I've been busy. Can I see you?
I was afraid that was just the one night, you know?
No, not for me, it wasn't.
Yeah, me neither.
Can I fall by?
-Yeah. -Okay, I'll see you in a little bit.
Thank you.
Good night.
Goddamn convention.
-Which one's Slick? -The wide one.
Got two transmitters.
One's in the wheel well, backup's in the firewall.
-Did you say good night to Neil? -Good night.
One with the blond hair is Chris Shiherlis. SIS has got a revolving tail...
...and hung a wire on the house phone.
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals depository three times.
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.
Sammy and I think that's gonna be their next score.
Who's the loner?
First time we're seeing him. We're not on him yet.
Well, get on it.
Okay.
When these guys walk out the door of whatever score they're gonna take next...
...they're gonna have the surprise of a lifetime.
Hey, baby. Time to go.
-I showed you a good time, didn't I? -Oh, yeah.
You fly. You cool.
You're lying to me. I can always tell when people lie to me.
I ain't lying. You a hot dog.
A regular rodeo rider.
And this was the monster fuck of my young life.
Now I got to get my ass street side, sugar.
You don't have a truth-telling style.
-What are you talking about? -You don't know what this is.
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.
Where you been?
SHU at Pelican Bay.
New Folsom, B-wing.
I am a cowboy looking for anything heavy.
Billy Ricketts said come see you.
That is why I am here.
Why don't you call this guy?
This guy's always putting guys on.
Thank you, brother.
-I'll buy you a drink? -Buy me a drink.
-What's so funny? -Nothing.
-It's really dumb. -Something smells negligent.
You two are perfect for each other. How did you meet?
I knew this guy in grade school.
He was named Raoul.... Whatever.
Anyway, the guy could take his fingers and fold them over, one over the other.
Then he'd turn his eyelids inside out....
I can't keep my hands off you, and that's the truth.
That's what's so wonderful about you, in that bestial sort of way.
Woman.
This better be earth-shattering.
That's what she tells us. To Raoul.
-Raoul. -To Raoul.
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.
Here's how we found her.
-How old? -Sixteen, seventeen.
Been here about six hours.
How'd she die, Rachel?
Beat her head in, same as the others. Cerebral hematoma.
Who's that?
-Mother and siblings, I guess. -What the hell they doing here?
Because it's fucked up. Somebody inside knew the girl and called the family.
Okay, let's go.
That's nice.
When I run a DNA check on the semen, my intuition says it's coming up the same guy.
So it's a series, and ending up in your court.
-Sheriff's Homicide getting anywhere? -Not yet.
-Get her. -Get off me. Get off me.
-Oh, my God. -Hold it, hold it.
-Where is she? -Easy, easy, easy.
Please. Please, come on.
-It's okay. It's okay. -Who did this?
Where's my baby? Where is she?
I need to know what happened.
I guess the Earth shattered.
So why didn't you let Bosko take you home?
I didn't wanna ruin their night too. What was it?
You don't wanna know.
I'd like to know what's behind that grim look.
I don't do that. You know it. Let's go. Come on.
You never told me I'd be excluded.
I told you when we hooked up, baby, that you were gonna have to share me...
...with all the bad people and all the ugly events on this planet.
And I bought into that sharing because I love you.
I love you fat, bald, money, no money, driving a bus. I don't care.
But you have got to be present like a normal guy some of the time.
That's sharing. This is not sharing, this is leftovers.
Oh, I see. What I should do is come home and say:
"Hi, honey, guess what? I walked into this house today...
...where this junkie asshole just fried his baby in a microwave...
...because it was crying too loud, so let me share that with you.
Come on, let's share that, and in sharing it...
...we'll somehow cathartically dispel all that heinous shit." Right?
Wrong. You know why?
Because you prefer the normal routine:
We fuck, then you lose the power of speech.
Because I gotta hold on to my angst.
I preserve it, because I need it. It keeps me sharp, on the edge.
Where I gotta be.
You don't live with me.
You live among the remains of dead people.
You read the terrain.
You search for signs of passing...
...for the scent of your prey...
...and then you hunt them down.
That's the only thing you're committed to.
The rest is the mess you leave as you pass through.
What I don't understand is why I can't cut loose of you.
Hey. Miss Lillian.
Let's go, baby.
I met the manager. Is that the boss?
I did time for what that motherfucker does every day.
Baby, can you just handle it till we find you something new?
Can you do that?
Ain't a hard time been invented that I cannot handle.
What you hanging with me for, Lillian?
Because I'm proud of you.
You're proud of me?
What the hell you proud of me for?
Come on home.
-What were you doing there? -I was skiing.
I was trying to ski.
That's what people do there. You go skiing...
...and you meet people.
You try to have a good time.
-Did you have a good time? -No.
Why not?
I'm not good at meeting people.
You met me.
Well, that happened without my thinking about it.
Which is why, probably.
No, it's because you were fine.
Eady.
Take off with me for a while.
-Where? -New Zealand.
When?
I have to go separate, but you could meet me there.
But my job, my--
I got money. You don't need money. You could set up a studio, do work there.
-I don't know. -What's there to know?
Are you married?
-What? -You come and go--
The last thing I am is married.
I'm a needle starting at zero going the other way, a double blank.
Then, all of a sudden...
...someone like you comes along.
-You don't know me, Neil. -I know enough.
Come with me.
What's wrong, baby?
Nothing's wrong. Everything's right. Will you go?
Yeah.
Good.
-Hey, sweetie. -Hi.
What happened? You forget your mom was picking you up?
No.
So, what's going on?
I felt like being alone.
Okay. Come on, I'll drive you home.
-Hey, Mike. -Hey, Lauren.
What's happening?
Lieutenant. Sir.
Captain Jackson wants to know what's going on.
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.
Technique.
Open sesame. Right there.
There he goes.
-We walk. -I'm right there.
We walk! Now! Come on.
He's heard it. He's heard it.
Heads up.
-One's coming out. -Hold it, captain.
-Vincent, he's not carrying anything. -Yeah, I see.
-Here we go. -Not till my boss says so.
Vincent, both of them are not carrying anything.
-Okay, let them go. -What do you mean? We can take them--
What are you gonna take them on? Breaking and entry? They didn't steal anything. Don't you get it?
They didn't steal anything. Don't you get it?
It gets knocked back to some misdemeanor...
It gets knocked back to some misdemeanor... ...they do six months and they're out. No fucking way.
I'm not taking the heat from my boss. They're not walking.
That's exactly what they're gonna do. They're gonna walk. This is my operation.
I have tactical command that supersedes your rank.
They will walk away and you will let them. Fuck.
Back to work.
L.A.P.D. Gee, what? Where the fuck did this heat come from?
Maybe it's the score they were onto.
The place, not us. Because it's been hit a couple of times, you know.
Assume they got our phones, assume they got our houses...
...assume they got us right here, right now as we sit.
Everything. Assume it all.
How we gonna buy the bank package from Kelso?
-I'll front that. That's not a problem. -What happens to Van Zant?
With the heat we got, do you wanna play World War II in the streets with Van Zant?
No, I want my 750. And he gets a pass?
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.
Our problem is, take the bank or split right now?
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.
Thirty seconds flat from now, we are gone on our separate ways.
That's it.
Chris.
The bank is worth the risk.
I need it, brother.
We should stay and take it down. That's where I come out.
I roll with you, Neil. Whatever. Whatever.
No, not on this one, Michael. On this one, you're on your own.
You figure this is the best thing to do?
This is the best thing to do?
I got plans. I'm going away after. So for me the reward is maybe worth the stretch.
But Elaine takes good care of you. You got plenty put away.
You got T-bonds, real estate.
If I were you, I would be smart. I would cut loose of this.
Well, you know, for me, the action is the juice.
I'm in.
-You too? -Yeah, sure.
Let's go.
Fuck them, let's do it.
All right, let's go. We got a lot of work to do.
-You can't go in there. -Watch this.
-Excuse me. That-- -Tim, I gotta call you back.
You have to have an appointment. -Can I help you? -Are you Alan Marciano?
-Can I help you? -Are you Alan Marciano?
-Yeah, and who the fuck are you? -Who am I?
-Hey. Hey. -Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, L.A.P.D.
L.A.? This is Las Vegas. You don't even have jurisdiction here.
Hey. Hey, I don't know who the fuck you guys think you're pushing around...
-...but I know people here, okay? -Las Vegas P.D. takes you into custody.
You are extradited to Newark on a New Jersey warrant...
...for smuggling cigarettes up from North Carolina three years ago...
...or you go to work for us.
Cut and dried.
-That is it. -Oh, shit.
Charlene Shiherlis.
-Who? -Who?
Who? What are you, a fucking owl?
The lady you been talking dirty to on the telephone every day the last week.
Yeah, you know what? You can't tie me to her.
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane back to New Jersey, jack off.
Oh, man, I just-- Why did I get mixed up with that bitch?
Because she got a great ass!
And you got your head all the way up it.
Jesus.
When I think of asses, a woman's ass...
...something comes out of me.
-So? -So no big thing.
All I want is her husband and his whole fucking crew.
Now, you're gonna work with Sergeant Drucker here.
San Clemente Road and Hermosa.
That's where we cut through the fence. That's the access.
Right.
The security systems around here are a joke.
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge, that's Escape Route Number 1.
Number 2, over here, Anaheim to the 110.
-Good. -Okay?
-Yeah. That's fine. -Got it? Good. Let's go.
They were looking back... ...in this direction.
A container facility?
-For a cartage theft? -Too visible. Too lowball for them.
Next door's an oil refinery, over there's a scrap yard.
Refinery only pays by check. No cash around.
Same for the scrap yard.
Maybe they're stealing hubcaps.
A refinery and a scrap yard.
-What the hell is going on? -That's what we're trying to figure out.
We thought we had it.
Thought we had it.
I got an idea of what they were looking at.
-You wanna know what they're looking at? -What?
I mean, is this guy something, or is he something?
This crew is good.
You know what they were looking at?
What?
Us.
The L.A.P.D.
The police department.
We just got made.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, motherfucker!
-Kelso come through? -Yeah, you can build a bank with these.
Name is Hanna. First name Vincent.
I smeared this sergeant in Vice five yards. Hanna's all over you.
He's on all the work cars. Michael's house, Shiherlis'.
Not yours, they've been losing you at night.
Hanna's a hot dog. Graduate school. Marine Corps.
Lieutenant, Robbery-Homicide, Major Crime Unit.
He's taken down some heavy crews. Blew away Frankie Yonder in Chicago.
And he was a fucking maniac.
He was working Narcotics before that. Had some problems, divorced twice.
Current wife's Justine. He's why the extra heat.
The Vice sergeant...
...says Hanna likes you.
Thinks you're some kind of star. You do this sharp, you do that sharp.
Look how sharp this guy is to figure that.
Funny as a heart attack, man. Three marriages.
What the fuck do you think that means? He likes staying home?
Means the man is one of those guys out there...
...prowling around all night, dedicated.
With this guy and this much heat, you should pass.
It's worth the stretch.
This guy can hit and miss. You can't miss once.
You sure?
I'm sure.
Let's go to the garage.
Justine.
Justine?
Where we going?
-Okay, where are you going? -Out.
-What are you on? -TAC 9.
This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18. Who have I got?
Hey, Vincent, it's JJ. I'm in Air 40. Richard Glover's with me.
It's on the 105 eastbound approaching the 110 interchange.
-You running a revolving tail? -Yeah, I got two units in front, three behind.
Okay, have one of them pick me up at the Vermont on-ramp.
Let's go.
Am I 100 yards, or what? Am I close or far, or what?
Three hundred yards, center lane.
How you doing?
What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?
-Yeah, sure. Let's go. -Follow me.
Seven years in Folsom.
In the hole for three.
McNeil before that.
McNeil as tough as they say?
You looking to become a penologist?
You're looking to go back? You know, I chase down some crews...
...guys just looking to fuck up, get busted back. That you?
You must've worked some dipshit crews.
I worked all kinds.
You see me doing thrill-seeking liquor-store holdups...
...with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?
-No, I do not. -Right.
I am never going back.
Then don't take down scores.
I do what I do best, I take scores.
You do what you do best, trying to stop guys like me.
So you never wanted a regular-type life?
What the fuck is that? Barbecues and ball games?
Yeah.
-This regular-type life like your life? -My life? No, my life....
No, my life's a disaster zone.
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...
...because her real father is this large-type asshole.
I got a wife. We're passing each other on the down slope of a marriage...
...my third...
...because I spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block.
That's my life.
A guy told me one time:
"Don't let yourself get attached to anything...
...you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat...
...if you feel the heat around the corner."
Now, if you're on me, and you gotta move when I move...
...how do you expect to keep a marriage?
Well, that's an interesting point.
What are you, a monk?
I have a woman.
What do you tell her?
I tell her I'm a salesman.
So then, if you spot me coming around that corner...
...you're just gonna walk out on this woman?
Not say goodbye?
That's the discipline.
That's pretty vacant, no?
Yeah, it is what it is.
It's that, or we both better go do something else, pal.
I don't know how to do anything else.
Neither do I.
-I don't much want to either. -Neither do I.
You know, I have this recurring dream.
I'm sitting at this big banquet table...
...and all the victims of all the murders I ever worked are sitting at this table...
...and they're staring at me with these black eyeballs...
...because they got eight-ball hemorrhages from the head wounds.
And there they are, these big balloon people...
...because I found them two weeks after they'd been under the bed.
The neighbors reported the smell...
...and there they are, all of them just sitting there.
What do they say?
Nothing.
-No talk? -None.
Just.... They don't have anything to say.
See, we just look at each other.
They look at me. And that's it, that's the dream.
I have one where I'm drowning.
And I gotta wake myself up and start breathing, or I'll die in my sleep.
You know what that's about?
Yeah. Having enough time.
-Enough time to do what you wanna do? -That's right.
-You doing it now? -No, not yet.
You know, we're sitting here...
...you and I, like a couple of regular fellows.
You do what you do, and I do what I gotta do.
And now that we've been face to face...
...if I'm there and I gotta put you away, I won't like it.
But I'll tell you...
...if it's between you and some poor bastard...
...whose wife you're gonna turn into a widow...
...brother, you are going down.
There's a flip side to that coin.
What if you do got me boxed in and I gotta put you down?
Because no matter what, you will not get in my way.
We've been face to face, yeah...
...but I will not hesitate. Not for a second.
Maybe that's the way it'll be.
Or who knows?
Or maybe we'll never see each other again.
They dumped us.
What?
-They dumped us. -What do you mean, they dumped us?
Chris slipped his tail.
He doesn't talk about scores with Charlene...
...so there's nothing for me to get from Marciano. I tried.
-What about Cheritto? -Same.
Transponders got put on a bus to San Clemente.
-They dumped all our surveillance? -Yeah, at the same time. Nine p.m.
I had coffee with McCauley half an hour ago!
We were on you. Then McCauley drives into LAX...
...where surveillance can't fly over because of flight paths.
His car's still there. He's gone.
Does anybody have any idea where the fuck these people are?
You hear from him yet?
Not a thing. And not hearing bothers me more. Where's this guy?
This guy here. We put him on. Says he knows McCauley.
Who are you?
Waingro. My name's Waingro.
I've been living in this office day and night. How well do you know him?
Oh, we took some major scores together.
How come I haven't heard from him?
Well, he's probably busy right now, but he's real thorough.
-He ain't gonna forget about you. -Oh, that's reassuring.
Well, I got some moves I could make here.
Probably be a big help to you.
You recognize the grill man?
-No. -Folsom. D-block. Housed with Dobie Rush.
-Ain't got my break yet, man. -Cisco and Pancho didn't show.
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.
Take your break later.
Piece of shit. Pick up.
Where the hell is he?
-I wanted to check the slot for a work car. -So did I.
Yeah?
Hang on.
-Yeah. -Hey. Use a landline. Call me at 103-7206.
Use a landline. Call me at 103-7206.
All right.
-Where are you? -There's cops all over me, man.
They're on me like a cheap suit. I can't dump them.
-After the fact you spotted them? -No, no. They're doing parallels.
I can try to dump them again.
How are we gonna know if you did? If you didn't, you'll draw them to us.
Head for Ventura. Pull them out of here.
All right. Hey, I'm sorry, man. Last thing I wanna do is let you down.
Pick up.
-Hey, hey, Neil, man. What up? -What's up, brother?
Man, what you doing here?
What I am doing is I'm looking for a driver who can handle scanners and a radio. Right now, today. You remember the drill?
Right now, today. You remember the drill?
-Yeah, man, sure. -You cool?
Oh, man, now, you know I'm cool.
One answer, yes or no. Right now.
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.
Out back in five.
-What's burning? What's burning? -Nothing I'm doing.
What is this?
Where do you think you're going?
And it will not stop or answer radio communication.
The 180-foot vessel is called Jin Yin Number 1...
...and is suspected of smuggling Chinese illegal aliens.
It was spotted Saturday by patrol aircraft.
-Stay down. -Don't move! Don't fucking move!
Put your hands in the air! Put your hands in the air! Put them up!
Down, down! Get on your knees.
-Give me the keys. -Get on your knees. Get on your knees!
Hey. Hey! Get over there. Get the fuck-- Get down.
Turn around! Put your hands behind you. Behind you!
Get down! Stay down!
Get down! Get down! Down, you stupid son of a--
-Down! Down, now! -Keys! Keys! Keys!
All of you stay down.
We want to hurt no one. We're here for the bank's money, not your money.
Your money's insured. You're not gonna lose a dime.
Think of your families. Don't risk your life. Don't try and be a hero.
Right now I want you to sit on the floor and put your hands on your head.
Anybody feels sick, anybody got heart trouble, go ahead and lean against the wall.
-Give me the key. -What key?
Get down and stay down!
Sit there. Sit there. Don't move. Let it bleed.
Get down!
Hey. Hey!
Put your head down.
-Look at me again, I'll kill you. -Stay down. Down.
-Put your head down! -Get down. Get down.
-Hey, Casals. -Yeah.
You guys working a case on a Neil McCauley?
This CI, Hugh Benny, called in about a bank they're looking at or something.
Vincent.
Far East National Bank, 11:30!
I want a block at Figueroa and 5th...
...and I want a block northbound Flower at 6th.
They're already coming out.
Okay, we're gonna have to take them in the car. Wait till they are all in.
Get clean shots. Watch your background.
-Police! Move! -What's going on?
Move. Move. Get down.
Look out.
-Move it, come on. -L.A.P.D. Get down.
Move it. Down, down, down.
We did it, right, Neil?
Move!
Get down.
-Fuck. Fuck! -In the car!
Go! Go! Go!
-Son of a bitch! -Go, go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Come on. Come on.
Get him out of here.
Get down! Now!
Shit.
Shit.
Out of the way! Down! Out of the way! Get them down! Now, now!
No, out of the way. Out of the way.
Mommy? Mommy!
Come here, honey.
Come on, honey.
I got you. It's okay now.
Tragedy in a Southland neighborhood today. A bank robbery spilled out into the street.
Claudia Newman, live on the scene. She has the latest. Claudia?
This afternoon, this neighborhood was terrorized by a bank holdup gone wrong.
With the streets full of mid-day shoppers and kids, police and armed robbers....
-Excuse me, bartender? -One minute, lady.
--robbery, pursuit and, finally, death.
A Los Angeles neighborhood is shaken by a bank robbery...
...that ended in homicide and terror.
One suspect, Michael Cheritto, is one of four men involved in the foiled robbery.
-He died at the scene. -What can I get you, miss?
Also fatally wounded, suspect Donald Breedan....
Miss?
--during the extensive gunfire between police and suspects.
All right, hold him. Hold him.
-All right. All right. -It's all right.
-So? -Well, he's got blood loss and shock.
I'm gonna give you quarter-grain morphine for the pain. Subcutaneous injection.
Bottom line.
It's mostly tissue damage, which is good, but his clavicle's fractured.
-Can he rest for a while? -Six, seven hours.
-That's it? -That's it.
-Take off your shirt. -What?
Take off your shirt.
My-- Look, my daughter gave it to me for Father's Day.
I don't give a shit who gave it to you. Take it off.
Chris. Hey.
Chris, listen to me.
Nate's gonna pick you up. He's gonna take you to his place.
-Where's Charlene? -We gotta get out of here.
We're all over the 6:00 news.
-We gotta get out of here. -I'm not going without her.
Think about that. I will meet you at Nate's.
Where are you going?
I gotta find out if our out got spilled along with every other damn thing.
Who did it?
Who wasn't there?
Trejo.
I'll see you at Nate's.
-Yeah. -Yeah. You still want me?
You come down here right now and you get me. Dominick and me. Okay?
Okay, baby, okay. I'll be there in two hours, all right?
-Okay? -All right.
Goddamn you, Chris. Goddamn you.
-You're on a plane for Los Angeles. -Great.
Why'd you do it? What happened?
-They made me. -Who?
Where's Anna? She's dead.
So is Michael and Breedan, the guy who stood in for you.
-Who did it? Who did it? -They had Anna, man.
Who had her?
Waingro.
Waingro.
On his own?
-For someone. -Who?
The other he worked for.
Zant.
-Van Zant? -Yeah.
Van Zant.
-Are you sure? -Van Zant.
Did you say anything about how we're getting out?
-I don't think so, Neil. -Come on.
I don't remember, Neil.
-I'll call a medic. -I'm not gonna make it.
I can't feel nothing.
My Anna's gone.
She's gone.
Don't leave me like this, Neil. Please, holmes.
Don't leave me like this.
-Yeah? -Nate.
You on a cellular? Use a hard line.
It's a new one.
The guy lives on Hillside Terrace, Encino.
-10725. -10725, okay.
-Chris? -He's with me, at my place.
Next, Waingro, okay?
You got the time?
I'll make time, and I need a new out laid on.
How do you know it's blown?
How can I trust it?
Okay, you got it.
Stay healthy.
Charlene Shiherlis.
Drucker's got a safe house in Venice to stash her in.
Our Neil's transportation. When we're done here, get on the phone.
Somewhere, someone's trying to put it together for him.
You don't believe McCauley already had a getaway?
Sure he did. Now he needs another one. Would you trust yours after this afternoon?
This rat motherfucker, where did we get him?
He's a CI for a burglary cop. Called in the tip on the bank.
On Neil McCauley, how much time we got?
Eight, 10 hours for him to set up a new out. After that, he's gone. Bye-bye.
You ratted McCauley to us. How'd you know? Who told you?
Who told you, you rat motherfucker?
Who?
Connelly back in for Murphy. Murphy with Leggat right there with him.
Murphy tees it up behind the net....
--Miller out front. Now here's Murphy with the referee....
Waingro, where is he?
-Where is he? -How the hell would I know?
Well, what do we have here?
Isn't this pretty? It's pretty.
-You slimy piece of shit. -You told me you wanted out from under.
You're scared to death, right? You want out? This is out, Charlene.
-Yeah, what's your end? -I-- You stupid broad.
-How'd I get into this? -Hey, hey, hey. Easy.
-How'd I get into this? -Hey, hey, hey. Easy. You heard me. She had a rough ride. Why don't you fix her a drink or something?
You heard me. She had a rough ride. Why don't you fix her a drink or something?
-Look in the cabinet above the sink. -Fuck her.
-You'd better get in there and stay in there. -All right, all right.
Well, lookie here.
My name is Sergeant Drucker, L.A.P.D. Homicide.
-You wanna put Dominick in the bedroom? -He stays with me.
There we go.
So, what now?
Well, he's right, because you want out, this is out.
-You believe you have to betray Chris. -No shit.
That's right. You would have to.
See, if you don't betray Chris, you victimize Dominick.
Because he becomes an orphan when you go to prison as an accessory...
...because you got no living parents to take him.
So he ends up state-raised in foster homes, juvenile facilities.
Then he steals a car.
Then he winds up in gladiator academies like Chino and Tracy.
Fucked for life.
You know what happens, because you've been there.
Dominick didn't get a chance yet to choose his life, but Chris did.
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.
You can do it for your kid, so you can raise him.
-What else are you selling? -All kinds of shit.
But I don't have to sell this and you know it, because this kind of shit here sells itself.
-Okay, Danny, here's an update. -Drucker's on Line 2.
Lieutenant, hold on for a second.
Lieutenant, I have Drucker on the other line.
Oh, well, conference him in.
-Go ahead. -Vincent, it's me.
I want an answer. What's it gonna be?
We're set here. She'll make the call.
Okay, that's good. Here's the deal here.
Hugh Benny has reformed his wayward life and become a born-again good citizen.
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us by this cowboy named Waingro.
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew...
...then he went to work for a money launderer named Van Zant.
Units are at Van Zant's house as we speak because he got shot dead earlier tonight.
Now, if Neil goes after anybody else, it's gonna be Waingro.
Waingro just got himself a suite at the airport Marquis...
...under the name "Jameson." He's there now.
I want you to get that to bail bondsmen, bookies...
...assignment officers and snitches in County.
Anyone you can think of who'll put it on the street.
Deploy a team at the hotel and personally check their coms every 30 minutes.
Because maybe Neil will go for him. Okay? How you feeling?
-Banged up, but I'll live. -Okay.
He's here.
Neil is still here.
I can feel it.
But for how long?
Seven, eight hours, max.
What did you do?
-That was you? -It's what I don't do, I don't sell metal.
Would have been okay, you fly out after. Now it's jammed.
-Now we gotta go together. -Those other people were with you?
My friend, Michael...
...he knew the risks. He didn't have to be there.
It rains, you get wet.
Get packed and let's go.
Eady. Eady.
Why did you do this to me?
Who are you?
It's gonna be all right. You understand? It'll be all right.
It's gonna be all right.
Right.
There's this Camaro at this address, Level D, Slot 18.
Here's some cash.
When's it over?
Twenty-two hours from now.
-Then we get out of here clean. -When will you let me leave?
Go now. You want out? There's the door.
Will you let me leave later?
It will be different.
Do you understand?
It's ready.
Vincent.
This is my friend Ralph.
You didn't tell me you were....
-Oh, my God. -Where's Lauren?
-She's at Lisa-Beth's. -Look, this has nothing to do with me.
-I didn't know. I'm terribly sorry. -What are you sorry about? Sit down.
-I didn't know. I'm terribly sorry. -What are you sorry about? Sit down. Don't you even get angry?
I'm angry, yeah.
I'm angry, yeah. I'm very angry, Ralph.
You know, you can ball my wife if she wants you to.
You can lounge around here on her sofa.
In her ex-husband's...
...dead-tech, post-modernistic, bullshit house, if you want to...
...but you do not get to watch my fucking television set!
For God's sake.
Put the television set down.
-I never cheated on you, bitch. -Maybe you should have.
-I should have? -In a way, you're a party to this.
Oh, yeah. I made Ralph fuck you because it makes me feel good.
Our situation is absurd.
-Look, maybe I should-- -Shut up, Ralph. Sit down!
Why is it that I have to figure things out and explain them to you? What do you do?
-I say what I mean, and I do what I say. -How admirable.
-You bet. -Except none of it's about us.
No.
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac...
...but you've been walking through our life dead.
Now I have to demean myself with Ralph just to get closure with you.
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.
The plane, charter terminal, LAX, Hangar 17.
Call letters are 1011 Sierra.
Touches down, holds for you five minutes, then splits.
The plane will stand an FAA check. Filed a flight plan, the works.
-Hey, where's Chris? -He's gone.
What?
Said he's going on his own. Went to look for Charlene.
-Didn't you bring him here? -Yeah, I brought him here.
What happened?
It's a free country, brother.
Check in with me at 9. Everything's still cool.
All right.
I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.
I know life is short.
Whatever time you get is luck.
You wanna walk?
You walk right now.
Or on your own....
On your own, you choose to come with me.
All I know is....
All I know is there's no point in me going anywhere anymore...
...if it's gonna be alone...
...without you.
Eady.
-Yeah. -Yeah, Vincent, I got a live one.
Okay, I'll hold.
Come on, sugar. Show yourself.
-Yeah, do it. -Shut up!
Now, just one second at the window...
...and it's all over.
Hey, man.
-Yeah? -You know any place to rent around here?
Yeah.
Alberiz's Grocer on Dell Avenue got cards on the wall.
Yeah, thanks.
It's not him. It's not Chris.
Unit 2, this is Command.
Take him at the street and check him out.
-Sergeant? -Yeah.
This guy's John Peterson. Valid ID.
Car's registered to the last name Bukowski, first name Gene.
Ran it to DMV. It's clean.
-Let him go. -Roger.
Thank you very much. Have a good evening.
It's a no-go, Vince.
Would you like a cup of coffee while we wait, Mrs. Shiherlis?
Yeah, that'd be nice.
-Yeah? -Yeah, what do you got?
Nothing's happening.
-Yeah? -Hello, it's Vincent.
What do you got?
Nothing's going on. Waingro went for ice. That's it.
You know what?
Neil is gone.
-Flying like a bird. -Come on, Vincent, how do you know?
-We still got bait. Maybe some time! -Got, got. What do we got?
What do we got?
Bon voyage, motherfucker.
You were good.
I'm going to the hotel.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Gonna sleep for a month.
Over here.
Come on, baby.
Okay, okay.
Shit.
Let me tighten this.
What a fucking waste.
Okay, here.
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day. Not you, baby. Not you.
Where would she be? Her name is Lauren, Lauren Gustafson.
I'm supposed to be here with her. But the police--
-Help me. I need somebody to help-- -It's okay.
I got you.
I got you, baby.
It'll be all right, honey. I swear. It's okay, baby.
Let's get a doctor! Let's go! A doctor here! There's your mama. -Let's just calm down. -Your mama's here.
-Let's just calm down. -Your mama's here.
-Is she on any drugs? -No.
I want you to get a trauma surgeon and a vascular surgeon.
I think she cut both arteries. Also, I could hardly feel her pulse.
Her pressure's down. So is her respiration. You have to intubate her.
It's ready.
-When's the last time anybody saw her? -I don't know.
-Where did you find her? -The bathtub.
Call Respiratory stat. Give her large-bore normal saline. Wide open.
Let's keep pressure on those bleeders. I need two units, O-negative.
-Let's type and cross her for six. -Looks like she's in some sinus tach.
-Let's type and cross her for six. -Looks like she's in some sinus tach. Where is Respiratory? We need more help. Can you have Respiratory come now?
Where is Respiratory? We need more help. Can you have Respiratory come now?
Let's have X-ray ready for post-intubation chest x-ray.
Hi. Your daughter's out of surgery and she's in the recovery room now, okay?
Her vital signs are stable. The surgeon will out to speak to you in a few moments.
-She's okay? -She's doing good.
-She's gonna be okay. -She's gonna be okay.
-She's gonna be okay. It's all right. -My baby.
-It's all right. -Why'd she do this to herself? Why?
Look what she did. Look what she did to herself.
It's all right, honey. It's gonna be all right.
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.
-You understand? -Yeah.
I ain't going anywhere.
-Yeah? -It's me.
Plane's in the air now. It'll be right on time.
On the driver's end, I still can't find nobody, so that's in the trust.
One other thing.
You asked, so I gotta tell you.
The guy you wanted checked into the Marquis under "Jameson"...
...if you still give a shit, which I figured you wouldn't.
-You figured right. -So, so long, brother.
You take it easy.
You're home free.
Take it easy.
-What is it? -Nothing.
Home free.
-I gotta take care of something. -Is there time?
There's time.
I'll be right back. Just leave her running.
-Registration. -Yeah, this is Room Service.
A Jameson ordered a BLT. They screwed up his room number. Could you give it to me?
-They're always doing that. -Yeah, I know.
-1735. -Thank you.
Your attention, please. We are currently experiencing a fire alarm.
Please do not panic. Please do not take the elevators.
-Shit. -Waingro's not moving. I'm staying here.
I'm checking the stairs. If there's smoke, I'm pulling you out.
What about her dad? You want me to call him?
He's somewhere in the Sierras.
And she chose you.
She picked your place.
It's not right, what happened to her.
No, it's not.
Okay.
Is there any way...
...that it could work out between us?
I wish I could say yes, you know.
But in the end....
You know, it's like you said:
All I am, is what I'm going after.
I'm not what you want, Justine.
Well, go on, if you have to.
-I'll stay. -No, I'm okay. I can handle this.
Just be careful.
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.
Okay?
Take the stairs.
Yeah?
Security. There's a fire on 3. We have to evacuate all the floors.
I can't leave here.
Why don't we just talk about this a bit, huh, brother?
He's here on 17.
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me.
L.A.P.D. Don't move. Put your hands on your head, now.
Switch me to TAC 5.
Casals? JJ?
Drucker, JJ?
Vincent, I'm at the lobby level by the stairwell.
What have you got?
Teams are moving up the other elevators to the 17th floor elevators.
All out of commission because of the fire alarm.
-It's a mess. People everywhere. -Fine. 10-4.
Let's go, get out of the way.
Stay out of the way.
Let's go. Go that way. We gotta go, all right? Go, go.
I got it, sir.
Come on, come on.
-Watch your backs, ladies. -I got it, I got it.
Come on, let's go.
This way, ma'am.
Get back, get back.
-Let me have that shotgun. -Yes, sir.
The entire city is mesmerized by this incredible sight.
Two hours after the first contact...
...an unidentified enemy has reached our coastlines...
...an unidentified enemy has reached our coastlines... ...in a swift and militaristic attack.
Right now, one thing is clear: The world is at war.
At 14:46 Pacific Standard Time...
...12 different locations across the globe were breached...
...in a coordinated attack by an unknown enemy.
All breaches were along the coastline...
...in what is a campaign of rapid dominance.
This is a textbook military invasion.
There are massive casualties in New York.
Defensive lines are being set up in Boston.
And at 13:15 Zulu time, we lost communications...
...with San Francisco and San Diego.
Their status is unknown.
What we know is that we are the last offensive force on the West Coast.
We cannot lose Los Angeles.
We have five birds down two klicks west of CP Victory.
We're hit, we're hit! Tighten your asses, we're going down!
Command and control is down.
Civilians in need of support two klicks northeast.
Cables inbound. Engage your sectors of fire, over.
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.
Good morning. 94.5 with the Surfrider Foundation Morning Surf Report.
Surfers, hard northeast conditions blowing out there...
...the ocean slopping and chopping. There is some size starting to build....
Come on. Come on.
-Morning, staff sergeant. -Morning, sergeant.
Morning, staff sergeant.
-Morning, sergeant. -Morning, staff sergeant.
Morning, staff sergeant.
Morning, you little prick.
You know what they say. You're only as old as you feel, staff sergeant.
That's what I'm worried about. I can't feel a damn thing.
--to the Pacific for our next report, where a cluster of meteors...
...is predicted to enter our atmosphere in the early hours tomorrow morning.
...is predicted to enter our atmosphere in the early hours tomorrow morning. Go ahead.
They're expected to strike miles from land, far into the Pacific Ocean.
-John. -Oh, God.
What's up, Mike?
Hey. What happened to that picture of us in Iraq with that camel?
I mean, your girlfriend.
Hey, is this for real?
It's got your signature. I said, "That's gotta be a mistake. He can't write."
No mistake, John. I did my 20. I know when to get out.
Come on. You got the box full of medals, a file full of commendations.
You can have them. Seems you like interior decorating.
A Marine's got a shelf life, you know? After that....
What? He spoils?
Something like that.
I'll finish my training assignment with these Marines.
Get them combat ready.
And then I'll be on my merry way.
You know, we could always use another lean, mean typing machine.
Shit, I ain't built like you, John.
Ugly, slow, soft.
God.
You had to make some tough calls there, Mike.
Especially that last one.
We all wish your men made it home.
Here we go.
You're expired.
Clear the shelf...
...staff sergeant.
Everything I know is in here, John.
What typically would have been detected months, if not years, before...
...surfaced in less than four hours.
These images giving some idea of the rate these meteors are traveling.
Scientists are abuzz, scrambling to try and understand it.
There's something just extremely uncomfortable... ...about a man your size sniffing a flower.
...about a man your size sniffing a flower.
What you want is some hydrangeas.
Popular wedding flower, come in green, blue.
What color is the bridesmaids' dresses?
-Good question. -You're amazing. Take a whiff. Smell it.
Yes, pretty girl?
For 300 more, she said we could have sprays of lilies.
Now, I know it's a lot, but it'd be so beautiful. What do you think?
300 dollars? Goodness gracious.
It's a no-brainer. You're only getting married once. Worry about 300 bucks?
-Thank you, Stavrou. Thank you. -Yeah, no worries.
You know what? It's your day. Do whatever you want.
I'm gonna hit you with something. What are you doing?
Busting your balls.
Tomorrow we shop for cakes.
And I can't wait.
I love cake.
Yo, Doc. What you doing? Skyping back home.
Is that your girlfriend? Damn, she fine.
Doc. My boy.
That's my sister.
Shoot, man. I'm speaking objectively here, you know what I'm saying?
All right, no, stop playing!
May I take a message?
Doc, is it all right if I have one of those first?
You eat it at your own risk.
They're very old.
So do you feel that you're making progress?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
I'm sleeping a lot better.
And then also around the firing range and everything...
...when I first came back and hear the pop, pop, pop...
...I'd get jumpy and it would mess with me a bit and a little bit of a setback.
But now it, you know...
...doesn't bother me.
So I think that's progress.
So, what's the story with my status, doc?
I mean, are you gonna clear me for combat? Because....
Yeah, I feel good.
Let's meet again next week...
...and we'll discuss it. Okay?
All right, thank you. Thank you very much, doc.
Harris' girl is making the dude organize his entire wedding...
Harris' girl is making the dude organize his entire wedding... ...two weeks before we deploy.
I say the chick's busting his balls like nobody's business.
But he got two weeks to get it done because we're out.
So I just came by to visit you one last time before we leave.
And I brought Dad's five iron with me. And you know what that means.
Me and the boys are gonna go out tonight, continue the tradition.
Have a good time, you know?
I'll see you soon, bro.
See you soon.
Motown, give me boots. I'm going skiing.
Oh, that's how you do it, baby.
Here they come.
Don't mess this up, man. They cannot know that you a virgin.
How do you know I-- Who says I'm a virgin?
We know you are. Look at your face.
What are you telling her? Telling her what?
Oh, come on, you guys. You're killing me.
That dog gonna hunt! Damn, Daktari, you can play, man.
We have courses in Nigeria, Imlay.
Shit. How am I supposed to know, man? It's an American game, right?
Adukwu's our Navy corpsman. He's like a medic.
No, not like a medic. Medic is the Army. I'm a Navy corpsman.
Well, sailor, yes.
I came here to become a doctor.
Slow down.
That's like number five.
How many have you had? No, I'm good.
-Now, this guy here, Mr. Lenihan... -Hey.
...his mom signed so he could join up at 17.
And I look after him because this boy don't know his ass from a hot rock.
-Not on my truck, dude! -Easy, now. Easy, buddy.
-Oh, yeah! -Not on my truck.
-Toast. To Lenihan. -To Lenihan!
Good luck, rookie.
Retreat, hell!
--emergency developing throughout NASA and the space community.
We now know that meteors will land off the coasts of eight different cities...
...and that number could keep rising.
Evacuations now under way in Southern California...
...moving the population back from the coastline.
But a lot of curious people are clamoring for views.
-What are you doing up so early? -Lieutenant. Still gotta get used to that.
This thing right?
-Here. You want me to do it? -It's tricky.
They gotta be parallel to the deck. That's the whole thing with these bars.
-Don't forget to call Mr. Gilliam, okay? -Okay.
-Call me later. -I'll call you later.
That's my baby. All right.
Let's go! Move!
Quick time! March!
Marines! Into the trucks and report to your company! Let's go!
Move it! Let's move!
Move it!
-Load them up! -Move it!
What's going on, first sergeant?
Meteors hitting off California now...
...but they got the whole goddamn base being mobilized.
I'm bringing you back to the company, Mike. They need you.
First sergeant.
All hands on deck, staff sergeant.
-You heard we might be mobilizing? -Yes, sir.
Moving you up to squad leader. It's a big responsibility, but you can handle it.
Thank you, sir.
Staff Sergeant Beck is being replaced by Staff Sergeant Nantz.
What do you know about him?
He's a very dedicated Marine.
Don't bullshit me, corporal.
What'd you hear about his last tour?
Just the grimy details that everybody else already knows.
But at the end of the day, you're our lieutenant...
...and we take our orders from you, sir.
You're assigned to 1st Platoon under Second Lieutenant Martinez.
His platoon sergeant's on leave, so you're gonna have to suck it up.
Yeah, so, here's the lieutenant right up here, 1 o'clock.
He's a kid, Mike.
Right out of officer training school.
He's only been with us a month, but I think he's sharp.
It's just an evacuation, buddy. He's in charge.
Just keep an eye on him, huh?
Just don't lose my paperwork.
-Lieutenant. -Good afternoon, staff sergeant.
-Happy to meet you. -Thank you, sir.
We're being called in to help with an evacuation? For these meteors?
I assume so.
Whatever it is, I'm happy to finally get out in the field.
At approximately 4:42 a.m. Pacific Standard Time... ...the meteors impacted....
Who the hell took my tortellini? You got tortellini?
This some kind of drill?
Get ready, man. Get ready. It's serious. Okay?
Meteors continue to fall off the coast of California, Ireland, Bay of Bengal....
Corporal. Corporal.
-Corporal. Corporal. -Yeah?
It's probably just a training exercise.
No, man. They're shifting Nantz into our unit. Something's going on.
The guy wants out of the Marine Corps and now we're stuck with him.
-Stavs! -You got tortellini?
I heard Nantz kicked ass his last tour.
He went into that compound alone and killed 10 insurgents.
-That's what you heard, Lenihan? -Chill out.
Yeah. Johnson in Foxtrot told me that he was going on--
Don't worry about it.
-Let's go, this is serious. -What the hell did I do?
Nantz got a couple guys killed on his last tour.
What?
That's the story. Lockett's brother was one.
So I know you didn't know, but just don't-- No, don't worry about it.
Looks like we're getting into some heavy shit.
It's been my experience, lieutenant, heavy shit is highly overrated.
Look, staff sergeant, let's just be clear.
I know your rep, know what you've done.
This is my platoon. These are my men.
-Not gonna have a problem, are we? -No problem, sir. She's all yours.
It appears our initial assumptions were wrong.
Listen up! Once you get your weapon...
...get your gear, get your munitions, move outside!
We got white chocolate rap from my man. That should finish the new mix?
National Guard troops have flown in to evacuate beach areas...
...and we have word the military is now deploying.
That's us. That's us! That's us!
-Calling military for a meteor shower? -I don't know why they're happy.
--a meteor that just hit the ocean.
Large plumes of smoke are coming up. Visibility is getting worse as we....
These objects were completely undetected... ...until they entered our atmosphere.
NASA estimates that they are not hitting the water at terminal velocity.
They're slowing down before impact.
These objects are falling into the ocean in tightly packed clusters...
...10 miles outside of a major population center.
Thermal imaging from the Hubble shows us...
...that within each cluster is a central object much larger than the others.
Now, these central objects are all the same geometric shape.
They appear mechanical in nature.
This is not a meteor shower, Marines.
We are in Threatcon Delta. That's right.
Come on. All units, gear up.
Be ready to move.
Combat situation.
It's what I've been training for.
I am told that one of the Coast Guard cutters has issued a mayday. It is difficult to see, and-- Oh, my gosh!
It is difficult to see, and-- Oh, my gosh!
There is just another meteor that just hit the ocean...
...and it's the closest one yet, right behind those cutters.
Two or three meteors just impacted.
Shit. Do you have any more information in the studio? Oh, my God.
Do you have any more information in the studio? Oh, my God.
Kate? Kate? Are you hearing us?
-Shut up, shut up, shut up! -Kate, are you still hearing us?
Yes, Jean, I can hear you. Everyone, move out. Get out of the way.
What is that? What is that in the water?
I can't really get a good look, but it appears there's something--
I'm looking through the people, trying to determine exactly what this is.
I don't even know. It's like shadowy figures.
Maybe five, six, seven. I can make out maybe eight figures.
-What the hell is that? -Holy shit!
-Look at that! -Stavs, you see that?
I'm gonna head back now. Everyone needs to get out of here right now.
I think that we've gotta leave, Jean. I'm gonna head back now.
Oh, my God!
Go! Let's go. Go, go!
Corporal Grayston and Corporal Imlay are both expert marksmen...
...as well as strong fire team leaders.
We also have PFC Lenihan, who is our second best marksman...
-...behind Lance Corporal Guerrero. -What's your take on this, Specs?
I don't know. Extraterrestrial?
-Do you mean like from space? -No, Imlay.
-From Canada. -Always got jokes, don't you, Stav?
-From Canada. -Always got jokes, don't you, Stav? All right, first squad, line it up. Bring it in. Let's go!
All right, first squad, line it up. Bring it in. Let's go!
As you may have heard...
...Staff Sergeant Nantz will be taking over for Staff Sergeant Beck.
We're lucky to have him aboard.
All right. Here's the situation, Marines. We're facing an unknown enemy.
We don't know how strong their force is or what they're capable of.
But one thing we do know is that we're fighting for our land...
...our families, our home and our country, goddamn it!
Whatever those things are, let's show them how Marines fight. Retreat....
-Hell! -Two-Five!
-Retreat, hell! -Let's form it up, let's go!
First in, last out, Marines!
Breathe, Lenihan. Breathe. Your training will kick in.
Thank you, staff sergeant!
-Got something to get off your chest? -No, it's cool, staff sergeant.
You got a silver star, my brother came home in a box. I get it.
All stations, this net. Standby for sitrep.
Enemy elements have advanced beyond the beach.
Aliens? That's not possible, right?
We'll know soon enough, brother.
One-oh-one tank has been destroyed. Company beyond the defensive line....
It's in case his head gets blown off, so they can identify his body.
Be advised, enemy have heavy assault weapons.
Firepower equal to high-explosive rounds.
Hey, staff sergeant! Promise me you won't let me be taken alive...
...by some godless predator from another world, staff sergeant?
No promises in combat.
Stop screwing around and keep your head in it!
These units are falling tactically. Their strategies are coordinated.
Do not underestimate enemy combat intelligence.
We are not evacuating civilians fast enough.
I say again, we are not evacuating fast enough.
All units be advised, there are friendlies behind enemy lines.
Semper Fi, 1-7 Actual, out.
You gotta take me to dinner first, baby.
Boys, hold on to something. Things are about to get rough.
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Out! Go!
Move, move, move!
Form it up!
-What do we got, sir? -All right, situation is as follows:
Most of Santa Monica's been cleared of civilians.
We got a defensive line at Lincoln Boulevard a mile from the ocean.
Air Force has got Warthogs and B-52s on deck.
At 1930 hours, they will pound the entire area from Lincoln to the ocean.
Shit.
We're leveling Santa Monica, sir?
We got an infestation of God knows what...
...not of this Earth and we gotta hit them with everything...
...and we gotta hit them hard. They are a ground-force enemy only.
They have no aircraft, so the Air Force will tear them a new asshole...
...and we will rule the air.
-You said "most civilians," sir? -Affirmed.
Getting distress calls, sending squads out.
Golf, you take Santa Monica to Olympic.
Foxtrot, Olympic to Pico.
Echo, Pico to Ocean Park.
Lieutenant Martinez, I want you to break off a squad... ...and a machine gun team.
...and a machine gun team.
Proceed west from Lincoln to a police station located here...
-...at Venice and Amarosa. -Venice and Amarosa.
Police were overrun.
Got a distress call that civilians are still there. We don't know how many.
Just gather survivors, then you radio in.
We'll have helicopters in the area to evacuate you out.
Now, be advised, you got exactly three hours before our bombs drop.
And make no mistake, they will drop, with or without you.
Get those civilians, get the hell out of there...
...and you kill anything that is not human.
Let's go! Let's get it done!
Captain, this is not a drill. You hold that line, you understand me?
Yes, sir.
--from the coastline into suburbs. Golf company is overrun.
Lima company requesting immediate air support.
Civilians are being stranded behind enemy lines.
Hang on, One!
Fire in the hole!
Troops are amassing in every coast, along every major coastline.
The UN has called an emergency sitting...
...in an attempt to establish a means for sharing resources... ...and intelligence across the globe.
...and intelligence across the globe.
Watch out, go!
This way? Where are we supposed to go?
Jesus Christ.
Marines, anything beyond this point, consider to be hostile.
All right, nice and easy.
Clear.
Hell of a way to earn your citizenship.
Shit. I'd rather be in Afghanistan.
Lieutenant. How many civilians we gotta get out of that police station?
I have no idea, Guerrero. Just stay focused.
-What the hell's that? What is that? -This is insane.
Yo, eyes open.
An unidentified enemy has breached our coastlines...
...in a swift and militaristic attack.
At this point, there are many more questions than answers.
Right now, one thing is clear: The world is at war.
Eyes open.
You see something, Simmons?
Can't see shit.
-Kerns, you see a cross street? -Lieutenant, I don't see nothing.
Police station's about one klick northwest of here.
-Twelve o'clock! -Hundred meters front.
-This is Echo 6, we need immediate-- -Turn your radios down.
-It's just a dog. -Just a little doggy. Come here.
-It's just a dog. -Dog.
-Dog. -Dog.
What's his name, huh? "Glenn."
Kidding me. Who's the idiot naming dogs these days?
What do you wanna call him, Fido?
Watch out!
-Where's it coming from? -I don't know.
Lenihan, watch your head!
On the roof!
Enemy fire! Eleven o'clock!
-They're on the roof! On the roof! -Cover him!
Twenty-five meters! Twenty-five meters!
-Lieutenant! -Left flank, on the roof!
Covering, covering!
-We gotta move now! -Lockett!
-Yes? -Get me an exit down that alley!
Yes, sergeant! Kerns, Motown, let's go!
Get up! Come on!
Falling back!
Let's go, come on!
Enemy fire! Watch your head!
-Where'd they come from? -Fall back!
Enemy fire, keep your head down!
It's all over the damn place!
What do you see?
I don't know, man. I don't see shit.
How do we get out of here?
-Lieutenant, where's the exit? -I'm working on it!
-Shit, we're boxed in! -I'll take a position by the wall! Go, go!
-Move out! -Ambush!
I don't have him! I'm hit!
Cover me, Lockett!
-Man down, man down! -It burns!
Shit!
I got you, Guerrero!
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!
I've got you covered! We have an exit! Everybody, move out! Move out!
We have an exit! Everybody, move out! Move out!
Move, move!
Staff sergeant, we got an exit! Come on, we're going! Come on, let's go!
Fall back, fall back!
Fall back, fall back!
Go, keep moving! Keep moving!
Lorenzo!
Move, move, move!
Keep moving, keep moving, keep moving!
I can't see shit!
Shit, shit, shit! Imlay!
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
U.S. Marines, coming in!
U.S. Marines, anybody in here?
Kitchen's clear! The kitchen's clear, lieutenant!
Get on that window! Are we clear?
Put the wounded in the kitchen!
Kerns, Lockett, secure the back of this house.
-Yes, staff sergeant. -Staff sergeant, we're on it!
Doc, how long till they're able to move?
Ten minutes. Ten minutes, staff sergeant. Ten minutes.
You want me? Come get some! I'm right here!
What do we got, Imlay?
I got nothing. I can't see a goddamn thing.
-With this smoke, it's zero visibility. -You're dead!
Stow that shit, Simmons!
You'll get shot before you're able to kill any of them.
Your orders, sir?
I led us right into that ambush.
-Mottola, anyone on command? -No, sir.
-We need to find answers to get out. -You're in charge, sir. Your orders?
Let's radio that evac to meet us.
Civilians or no, we gotta get these wounded out.
-Roger that. -Hey, guys, guys. Where's Lenihan? I didn't see him with us. Where is he?
I didn't see him with us. Where is he?
-Lenihan? -Lenihan?
Anybody got eyes on Lenihan?
-Lenihan! -I'll go for Lenihan, sir.
Imlay, Harris, on me. Let's get this shit out of here.
I'll package the wounded. Rally on 10th Street.
Be prepared to move. We're moving out soon.
Shit.
Mottorola.
Mottorola?
Oh, come on. Mottorola, you copy?
Lenihan, where are you?
Staff sergeant?
Jesus Christ. I had to turn my radio off. These things are everywhere.
We're coming for you. What's your location?
I'm in the laundry room of some apartment complex.
It's like three stories--
What color is it? Lenihan. Lenihan?
Shit.
Lenihan.
Shit.
So smooth....
Smooth is fast.
Shit.
Oh, shit.
-Lenihan! -Lenihan, lower that weapon!
What the hell--?
Keep on firing!
Jesus Christ! What the hell is that thing?
It's not dead. They don't die. I've hit it a hundred times. They don't die.
Get separated from the unit again, I'll find you and shoot you myself.
Imlay, drop a grenade in that pool. Let's move!
Come on, I got you. I got you.
Frag out.
Street's clear.
Get down, get down, get down.
-What's happening? What's going on? -All right, we're good. Come on.
-It's Lenihan. -Yo, Lockett.
You owe me $5. I told you, a virgin ain't gonna die till he get him some.
Move to the police station?
-All right, let's move. Let's move. -Move it. Move it out.
-Where'd that come from? -Door's open at the bank!
Take care of him.
Where'd the shot come from?
-Kerns! -Door's open on the bank! Let's move!
Come on, let's go! Move! Move it!
Stavrou, you got front. Stavrou, cover front. Harris, cover front!
Roof's clear, roof's clear!
I got it. I got it covered. Harris! Find me where that shot came from, guys!
Harris! Find me where that shot came from, guys!
Imlay, get eyes up on that roof, all right?
-Cover the roof! -Roof's clear, roof's clear!
Lockett, on me!
Did anybody even see where that came from?
Doc, how serious?
Third degree thermal burns on his neck and his face, sir.
You'll be surfing soon, Simmons.
Shit.
-Hostiles, 12 o'clock! -Hostiles at 12 o'clock!
Staff sergeant, hostiles, 12 o'clock!
Prepare to fire!
Hold it, hold it!
Friendlies, sir.
-Shit. -Friendlies. Let's get them in.
Get over here.
Move. Move to the back. Let's go. Come on, get.
-What's your unit? -40th, ID.
Where's the rest of your unit?
Everyone else is either dead or missing.
I picked up Air Force here.
Tech Sergeant Elena Santos, Air Force.
61st Wing, intel, surveillance, recon division.
Tech sergeant? What the hell are you doing here?
We were tracking enemy transmissions about 12 klicks south of here.
They ambushed us like they knew our freaking address.
I'm the only one left.
I found these guys on the way to the safe zone at Santa Monica Airport.
You ready to use that weapon, tech sergeant?
With all due respect, staff sergeant, I didn't get this far off of my good looks.
-I'm ready for payback. -Outstanding.
Lieutenant, bird inbound, 25 minutes, sir.
Roger that. Let's get to that police station.
All right, let's get Simmons and move. Let's go!
Cover our flanks, Mottorola! To the right, in that building!
Watch your feet!
There's the police station.
Let's get those civilians and get back to the F.O.B.!
Gotta rock, gotta rock!
Come on, come on, come on.
I'll stay with our wounded, wait for the medevac.
I'll go for civilians. Kerns, Dever, on me.
-Mags, mags. I need mags. -All right.
Santos, when that bird arrives, I'll need your help on this stretcher.
U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!
Door. The door.
-Elevator right. -Clear!
Elevator right.
Second elevator, clear! No pulse.
Door left.
It's locked.
-What's your name? -Harper.
-I'm gonna need you on this stretcher. -Bird incoming, sir!
Roger that. Imlay, pop smoke!
-Door locked. -Door left.
Radios off.
Move.
U.S. Marines! U.S. Marines!
-How many of you? -Five of us, three kids.
Kerns, kids!
-Let's move! -Let's go, let's go!
All right, let's get ready to move! Let's get it up!
-Here we go! Let's move! -Aye, sir!
We got room for four and that is it! That is it.
-Get your wounded on! Move it! -Oh, yeah, baby.
Come on. Come on. Get up. Get up.
Get him in. Hey, Guerrero.
I'll work on that mix for you!
I'm gonna need it, dude! You're gonna be fine! You're gonna be fine!
Give them hell!
-Oh, shit. -Come on, man.
You just had to get out of the shit.
-You take care of yourself! -I will.
I'll see you soon, partner.
-That's it. -We have civilians coming out!
-We can't take them, we got no room! -Make room!
We can't! Now, get back, sir!
Fall back. Move back, move back, move back!
Wait! Kids, kids!
Get back to the police station!
Backtrack, everybody! Come on, back!
They have air power. Again, enemy has air support. We have a bird down.
Damn it!
Tango's heading northeast of our grid.
We've disengaged back into a police station. We have civilians.
I say again, we have civilians.
Lockett, Kerns, secure this door. Nothing gets in, you understand?
We got a body. Do you think you could get rid of it so the kids don't see it?
What do you want? Where should we go?
Dever.
Set up back there, okay?
Come on, you guys. Take the back.
Stay away from the window, all right?
Are there gonna be more choppers? Did you guys call any in?
I'm sure they're gonna come for us. They know where we are.
Shit. You okay? You all right?
-I'm good. Yeah. -You sure?
-You didn't get hit or nothing? -No, I'm good, man. I'm good.
Man, they're gone. They're gone.
Everybody's gone. Lenihan, Guerrero, Grayston.
Grayston. Grayston had kids.
Didn't deserve that. Didn't deserve that!
He didn't deserve to go out like that!
Neither do you! You hear me? You're gonna make it through this!
All right? You're gonna get out of here. You're gonna marry Cherise.
And you're gonna be her problem...
...because I'm done taking care of your sorry ass, you got that?
All stations, this net. Sitrep as follow:
Enemy aircraft number four fleets at this time.
Be advised, more entering battle space Los Angeles from ocean...
...on bearing 2-niner-7-5-0.
They got air support too.
Knocked our bird right out of the sky.
So much for ruling the air.
There's no time for that, lieutenant.
Those bombs are gonna drop.
And we're in the blast radius.
Top of my goddamn class.
And I get out in combat in the middle of that shit? Goddamn it!
I already lost four of my goddamn men!
Four good men.
Who would go to hell and back for you, sir.
-Have you? -Yes.
You're not the first to lose men. You won't be the last.
Now, put that away. You understand me?
Right now your men are awaiting orders.
Now, you can go left, you can go right. I don't give a damn.
Just make a decision.
Lieutenant.
It's a no-go on the helo, sir.
Enemy aircraft is lighting it up.
Command says it's like nothing they ever seen. We gotta find a way out.
We gotta find a way out.
We gotta get to that F.O.B.
You're right. We gotta move.
Let's get these people safe. Lockett, Kerns!
I need you to set up an observation post on the roof.
We're gonna move by foot, so we gotta move fast. Scan for hostiles, find the best route out of here.
Scan for hostiles, find the best route out of here.
All right, sir.
Lieutenant.
Officials are now saying any civilian within 10 miles of the coast...
...should try to make their way... ...to a military forward operating base, F.O.B.
This is the safest place that you can be right now.
Now, the military has set up a line of defense to try to protect civilians.
Take a look at you, make sure you're okay, all right? Good. Okay.
Just look at this. There you go.
-Water fountain is there, Mr. Rincon. -Okay, thank you.
-No problem. -Thank you.
-Joe Rincon. -Staff Sergeant Nantz.
This is my son, Hector.
We all wanted to thank you for coming to get us.
Yeah.
Hey, Hector. We leave no man behind.
So you here when the police got overrun?
Right. Well, long as you're both okay.
Hey, you all right, man?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
Okay.
If you-- If you need him to do anything...
-...you know. -I'll let you know.
Aye-aye, sir.
Aye.
Thank you.
We got two dozen hostiles about 300 meters out.
Lieutenant, we got two dozen hostiles 300 meters north, over.
It's like those things are on overwatch, just like us.
That one out front looks like the leader. Now they got leadership.
So do ants, Kerns.
You think those things get scared too?
Probably just like us. They're probably just grunts that get told to go fight.
Come on. Find us a way out of here, Marine, because we're sitting ducks.
They dragged them out of the house, into the street...
...put them in perfect order before they shot them.
They shot them right in the head.
Chief, do we have any idea why this is happening?
Well, it's clear there has been no attempt at any kind of communication.
No demands, nothing like that.
So, obviously, they are here for our resources.
When you invade a place for resources...
...you wipe out the indigenous population.
Those are the rules of any colonization.
And, right now, we are being colonized.
Brave kids.
They're my nieces. My sister and her husband are away on vacation.
Thing is, they live in Arizona. I see them once or twice a year.
And now I may be all they have left.
-You have kids? -No.
Neither do I.
I used to regret that, but maybe it was for the best.
Of course, our planet's surface is 70 percent water.
So again, and I have to stress this, without certainty...
...the leading hypothesis remains that their objective, their target...
...is our water.
-Shit. -There ain't gonna be nothing left.
-I think I got a way out of here. -What'd you say?
Right here, look. 200 meters out.
-What's right behind that backside? -Bus.
-Lieutenant, we got a bus. -Roger that.
So the men on the roof saw a bus. They think it could be operational.
Maybe we'd be better off on foot.
It's miles to the operating base...
...and those bombs are gonna drop in an hour.
We gotta move fast.
Bus is a big target.
I made the call.
It's my responsibility.
Stavrou, Harris.
Lieutenant needs recon on a bus. If it runs, get it back here.
-You know how to hotwire a bus? -Stavrou can. He's from Jersey, sir.
Ladies first.
Two hundred meters.
Go down, there's the cars burnt out, there's a pickup truck.
Right back behind there.
We have a situation. Y'all need to follow me.
Harris found it out here. Y'all gotta see this thing.
Weapon looks like it's been surgically attached.
Talk about commitment to cause.
Shit.
-You gotta be kidding! -Corporal. Corporal, hold it.
Let me shoot this thing, staff sergeant. That weapon's hot.
Let me just shoot it.
-Doc. -Yes, staff sergeant.
Oh, Lord, have mercy.
We need to know exactly where to hit this thing...
...so we don't waste all our ammo.
Maybe I can help.
I'm a veterinarian.
Sure you wanna do this?
I was more sure when I was standing over there.
We gotta figure out how to kill these things.
Otherwise, we won't last another five minutes out there, okay?
Let's peel this back.
-Look at this, we got a organ here. -Jesus Christ, look at that.
-I got another one. -Me too.
Does it have some sort of cognitive mechanism? Anything?
There's no frontal lobe, no temporal lobe, no parietal lobe.
The cranial vault is unlike anything.
-Oh, shit. -What?
-You see what I'm seeing? -What?
The ones that were just on the roof aren't on it.
There's about two dozen coming out the door.
They're on the street heading this way.
-Lieutenant, we got movement up here. -Roger that.
We have contact 300 meters out. We gotta cut quick.
Lieutenant, we gotta move! What do we do?
-Shit's hitting the fan. Gotta move. -Staff sergeant.
Come on, how do you kill this thing?
Goddamn it, Stavs.
-I lost them. -You lost them?
Lieutenant, they're gone. Lieutenant, I don't see anything.
-We got a breach. -Got a breach on the north entrance!
They're inside.
I'm gonna gather everyone by the doors on the south side.
We're right behind you.
-Adukwu, you go with her. -Yes, staff sergeant.
-Imlay, got an HE grenade round? -Never leave home without it.
You cover that hall to the rear. Buy me some time.
They start coming, you blast the hell out of them.
Hey, Harris. Where's that goddamn bus?
Stavs. Stavs, we got an enemy scout. Come on, let's go.
Yes! Yes! Yeah, baby! Newark! Represent!
Lieutenant, we've got the bus, heading back.
Okay, guys, the bus is en route! Bus is en route!
Thirty seconds till we move out!
Imlay, give me a sitrep. I need an update on the breach.
Report back, over.
We're running out of time.
Move!
Contact!
They've breached.
This is our last shot.
Got it.
Right here.
That's gotta be it. It's dying.
That's how we kill this thing, to the right of where the heart would be.
-Got it. -I got three more!
Let's get out of here.
Get them on the bus! Get them on that bus! Let's go, let's go!
-Get on. -Get underneath.
You okay?
Heads up. Cover your sectors of fire. Heads up!
Marines, concentrate firepower to the right of where the heart would be.
Yes, staff sergeant.
That's how we kill these things.
All right, remember your training.
We got a hostile warbird, thousand meters out.
Everybody keep your eyes up.
All buckled up back there, lieutenant.
Roger that.
It should be about six miles to the F.O.B.
I don't know, 25, 30 minutes.
If we stay on these side streets.
Air Force is gonna level this area in 40 minutes.
Get us to the forward operating base. Fast.
What the hell is that?
Stavrou, stop the bus.
Everyone, get down.
Any station, this is Foxtrot-Two-November. Sitrep to follow.
Go ahead, Foxtrot-Two-November.
Enemy aircraft. They're lighting up the sky...
...heading east towards downtown Los Angeles.
Copy that.
They're tracking our signals.
Mottola, turn off that radio! They're tracking our signals!
All radios off! Cell phones, everything!
Give me your radio.
Mottola. Give me your radio.
Where you going? -Staff sergeant! -Where the hell is he going?
-Staff sergeant! -Where the hell is he going?
-We gotta get off this bus, all right? -Ten o'clock, lieutenant, 10 o'clock!
I see it, 8 o'clock, heading south!
It's getting closer. Hey, it's at my 6!
A hundred meters!
Oh, my God.
Everybody, get down!
Holy shit.
-What was that? -Is he all right?
-Did he make it out? -Staff sergeant?
-There he is. -Staff sergeant's alive!
-Yeah, he's alive! -There he is!
That aircraft was unmanned, lieutenant.
Drone.
That was some real John Wayne shit, staff sergeant.
Hey.
I can't afford to lose you. Neither can these men, all right?
Yeah. They're your men.
All right, staff sergeant!
That's how you do it!
-That's retreat, hell! -That's right.
Who the hell's John Wayne?
Everybody, eyes open!
Stay alert!
Thank you for that.
It's nothing.
What's that mean, "retreat, hell"?
During World War I, an officer from our regiment was ordered to retreat.
He said, "Retreat, hell. We just got here."
You should have the doc take a look at that.
I thought you were a doctor.
Animals and aliens only.
I'll put it on my to-do list.
Thank you.
Excuse me, staff sergeant. Did you say that was an unmanned drone?
Correct.
They must have one hell of a command-and-control system.
If NORTHCOM didn't agree with you, I wouldn't be here.
Why?
My mission was to provide AIS with a strike package.
A strike package?
Yeah, coordinates for a missile strike on a command-and-control center. But the asset fell off the grid and we lost them.
But the asset fell off the grid and we lost them.
All side streets are blocked. Our only choice is to take the freeway.
All right. Well, it's your call.
Stavrou, get us on a freeway.
We don't wanna be in this area when these bombs start to fall.
Try to miss at least one of the cars, Stavrou.
Just keep driving.
Off ramp is one mile ahead.
Jesus.
Look out.
The ramp, it's gone, lieutenant.
All right, Robertson exit, half a klick away.
Look out! Incoming, 12 o'clock!
-You okay? -Harper!
Tank's drawing enemy fire! It's a good time to move!
I'll suppress the fire, you take the civilians!
Secure this exit, Imlay!
Imlay, get me a defensive line on that vehicle!
-Move, move, move! -Let's go! Come on.
-Let's go! -Come on, stay down, stay down!
Just keep everybody calm. We'll be right back, all right?
Just keep everybody calm. We'll be right back, all right? All right. Safety first, buddy.
Martinez, if we get the civilians to that helo, they take cover, rappel down.
I got a dozen up on the bridge. They're moving down.
Lieutenant! Tank's out! Nothing's stopping them now!
Staff sergeant, civilians won't make it to that helo without cover fire.
Lockett, Kerns, on me, let's go!
Let's move, let's move, let's move!
Get the civilians down, all right? Move!
About a 30-foot drop. Let's go.
Get behind the bus! Now, now, now! Get behind it!
Kids first! Around the body, bring them down one at a time.
Roger that.
Imlay!
Get your team up on that garbage truck!
Staff sergeant, cover us up front! Stavs, you're with me! On me now!
We're gonna run behind that helicopter and we're gonna rope down, all right?
The girls will be first.
I promise you nothing's gonna happen. Okay? Stay down!
Lieutenant, dozen hostiles, maybe more!
Four hundred meters and closing fast!
Cover, cover! What the hell are you doing?
You guys need another gun.
Three o'clock. Up on the bridge, Santos. Up on the bridge.
Incoming!
Ten o'clock!
-Reloading! -Aim for the leader!
Hell, you can take all the room you want.
Mottola, move, move, move!
Yes, staff sergeant! Come on, let's go! Let's go, go, go! Run now, run!
Keep running! Don't stop, run! Run, run, run!
-Get in there! -Cover me!
-I'm going for the .50 cal! -Hurry up!
Get some, Lockett.
-Shit. -What the hell is that thing?
I'm engaging!
You'll be okay, all right? It's okay. Listen to me. You're going to be okay.
I got you. I will not let anything happen to you, all right?
Shit!
Man down!
You're gonna be okay. Hold on, hold on! Keep going. Hold on!
Keep looking up!
I got you. It's okay. It's okay.
Get the ant that's controlling that thing!
Lockett, get off your ass!
It's turning this way!
It's about to hit the fan, guys. Get out now! Move!
Santos, come on!
-Come on! -I'm stuck.
Go!
-What are you doing? -Go!
Imlay!
Where's Stavrou?
Mottorola! How many down?
Two down, staff sarge! One to go!
Look at me, look at me. Look, look. Be good, okay?
-It's gonna be fine, okay? You ready? -Lieutenant, C-4!
Let's blow this sucker to hell!
Let's do it.
Kerns!
Covering!
All right, dough is good to go!
-Go! -Covering!
Damn it! We've lost the detonator.
-You all right? -Yeah, got the wind knocked out of me.
-Mottorola! -Dad!
You're okay, Hector! You're okay.
Hold on!
-I need bandages from the first aid kit. -Sir! Sir!
It's okay!
Oh, my God!
All right.
We gotta get you to a medevac.
Doc!
Oh, shit, man!
-We need some cover! -Damn it, I'm out! -Got another mag, Lockett? -They kicking our ass!
-Got another mag, Lockett? -They kicking our ass!
You're getting pinned down, staff sergeant!
Marines, you're getting pinned down!
-We're not leaving you. -Staff sergeant, get them out!
-Lieutenant, I am not leav-- -Get them out!
-No, I'm not leaving you! -Get them out!
No! Not again!
I have a bag of C-4 on the bus.
Give this to my wife...
...and get them off this goddamn freeway.
That's an order.
Yes, sir.
Right behind you.
Cover the lieutenant!
Hey, I'm out!
They're closing in!
Here we go.
This is Lieutenant William Martinez...
...Echo Company, 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines. Hoorah!
We're still half a klick inside the bombing zone.
Move to live, Marines.
Did he just leave the lieutenant back there to die?
Sure looked that way.
And this is the guy in charge of us now?
Let's move.
Hey, those are our jets. We're still in the fight.
All right, we're clear of the bomb zone.
Let's tighten this place down.
Bombs drop in six minutes.
Santos, Kerns, on me.
Let's see if there are any comms. All right? Hardwire only.
-Corporal Harris, we clear? -We're clear!
-Do you have a hard line in here? -Over there.
Now, my son's an optimist.
When this first happened, he said, "Why don't we go try to talk to them?
Maybe they wanna be friends."
Hector? Hey.
We're gonna go get some food and water for your dad, okay?
It's okay.
And what'd you tell him?
I said:
"You know, if they're chasing and shooting us...
...they're probably not good friends."
I should've followed directions and gone to the F.O.B.
I should've never stayed at the police station, but I was scared, man.
I made all the wrong decisions.
You trusted your gut, Mr. Rincon.
You made a call.
I'd do the same thing to protect my Marines.
-I had a situation my last tour. -Yeah?
There was no right call. You went left or you go right, it didn't matter.
But you're alive.
Yeah, I survived.
But I wasn't supposed to.
Staff Sergeant Nantz....
You promise to save my son?
Staff sergeant, we have a hardwired connection!
Doc, keep him warm. Sun is going down.
This will keep you warm.
We're estimating that 20 cities in 17 countries are now under full attack.
It's obvious the enemy is attempting to cut us off from one another. Is there any more information at this time, Professor Stavert?
Is there any more information at this time, Professor Stavert?
New data shows that they're using our water as their fuel... ...and our ocean levels are already decreasing.
...and our ocean levels are already decreasing.
They are using it to power their ships, their machinery...
...possibly their own bodies. It's the composition of our water that's unique.
It's in a liquid state. No other locations in our known universe...
...have liquid H2O anywhere near their surface.
I just saw a field report that said they will use our sewage systems...
-...to follow our water to their ships. -How'd you get that to work?
These things are everywhere. There's one off the coast of 20 countries.
They're calling it the command-and-control center.
-That's the thing you were tracking? -Yeah.
So you're saying that's the thing that's controlling the drones?
Yeah. And if we wipe it out, we take out their air power.
These bombs better work.
-Let's move it. -Bring him through here.
-Set him down. -How much time we got?
One minute.
Air Force about to lay some pain on those extraterritorial bastards.
-All right, Two-Five, retreat.... -Hell!
-Retreat.... -Hell!
Here we go.
Come on. Let's fry these sons of bitches.
We get to the F.O.B. after these bombs drop, get ammo.
And some goddamn reinforcements. Some goddamn tanks.
-Ten. -Gotta be strong, okay?
Nine.
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
Five.
Four.
Three....
Shit. Everybody, brace!
-They should've dropped. -What the hell?
Wouldn't we have felt that from here if they'd dropped? We would've felt them.
Would've felt it in Nevada with that ordnance.
That clock right?
That's what I got.
Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe we turned the tide. That's a good thing.
You damn straight, Imlay. We was kicking some ass.
Could they have taken out the whole Air Force?
This isn't happening.
Let's move. Everybody, up, up. Let's move. Come on.
Everybody, up, up. Let's move. Come on.
We're in the home stretch, everybody. We in the home stretch.
Now we know why those bombs didn't drop.
They wiped our forward operating base right off the map.
All clear, staff sergeant!
All right, let's bring him back here.
Hang in there, buddy.
Million-and-one odds we'd get here in the first place...
...we get here and there ain't nothing. I knew Nantz would never get us out.
-There were thousands of Marines here. -Now it's just seven of us, Imlay.
You remind me of my older brother.
How's that?
He never smiles either.
Secure the front with Harris.
Imlay, anything?
Nothing. We only got maps of Santa Monica.
We need something farther east. They're all burned.
Follow me, Imlay.
All right, here's the battalion commander's hooch.
Looking for maps, anything with an extraction point.
Staff sergeant.
I'll be right back.
Found a tactical map, staff sergeant.
Shows where all the units were deployed.
-What the hell are all these red marks? -Means they're gone.
-You mean the units got moved? -Wiped out.
-All of them? -All of them.
Oh, shit.
All right. One alternate extraction site is still operational.
That's eight klicks. Staff sergeant? Staff sergeant.
Staff sergeant? Staff sergeant.
Adukwu, plenty of weapons around. Find yourself an M-16.
Mr. Rincon is dead.
Wake up, Dad.
Please help me right now.
Don't leave me.
I'm so sorry, Hector.
I'm sorry.
No.
Your dad tried so hard to stay with you.
-I'm sorr-- -I don't wanna be here.
It's okay, bud.
Your father was a brave man, Hector.
Hector, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, buddy.
It's okay to cry.
He loved you very much.
Listen to me, Hector.
I need you to be brave for me. I need you to be my little Marine.
Okay?
We gotta be brave for the others.
Do you know why?
Why?
Because Marines don't quit.
Do you believe that?
Say it for me.
-Marines don't quit. -Good.
I'm gonna get you out of here, Hector. I promise.
Let's go see the girls, okay? Come on.
We are not losing one more of those civilians. Understand?
You getting us out too, staff sergeant?
Or are we expendable?
All right, Lockett.
You wanna go there, let's go there.
I commanded men and men died.
Kids. 19 years old. The best men I ever led.
Do you think for one second I wouldn't rather trade places with them?
I know you think I got my men killed.
They're dead.
I'm here.
Like the punchline to some bad joke.
You think I like that?
Do you think a minute goes by that those faces aren't right here...
...seared into my brain?
Dante, Thomas T. Corporal. 1-5-6-5-0-9-3-8-6.
Ambruster, William R. Private. 8-7-6-6-6-2-3-5-4.
Wharton, Jeffrey H.
Lance Corporal. 8-7-4-2-7-3-9-9-3.
Lockett...
...Duane G.
Corporal.
1-5-6-8-7-0-9....
Five-five.
Your brother was an outstanding Marine.
He was my friend.
And I miss him every day.
And you remind me of him.
None of that matters right now.
Because our duty is to keep moving forwards, to keep fighting.
That's how we honor your brother...
...and Lieutenant Martinez...
...Corporal Stavrou...
...Lance Corporal Mottola...
...Hector's father...
...who picked up a rifle and did what needed to be done. A civilian.
So we better damn well step it up.
Discard any lingering doubt.
Work fast, work as a unit, and we will prevail.
Let's figure out how we're gonna get out of this.
Imlay, you come with me. Get to higher ground.
The rest of you, find some ammo and some vehicles.
Gotta be a few LAV's or armored Humvees still operational.
Sorry, bro. You didn't deserve this.
You went down fighting.
Holy shit.
I wasn't expecting to see all this.
That don't look good.
Reinforcements.
Holy shit.
They already set up a beachhead.
All right.
If that evac site is still operational, I think we can get behind the line.
That's gonna be one hell of a ride.
Yeah, well, that's what we get paid for.
Everybody move to the LAV now! Go!
Any station, this net. This is Foxtrot-Two-November.
Any station, this net. This is Foxtrot-Two-November. We have 11 passengers. Requesting evacuation at alternate extraction point Charlie.
Requesting evacuation at alternate extraction point Charlie.
Are there any birds in the air? Over.
Foxtrot-Two-November, this is Sierra 2-5. Orders are to pull back.
Get to extraction point Charlie by 0300 or we'll be gone. Over.
Roger that. 0300, not a minute more. Out.
Imlay, ever see what a Bushmaster chain gun can do?
-Oh, shit, yes, staff sergeant. -Get on it, son.
Let's do this!
-No lights, Kerns. -Roger that.
Let's move.
Bushmaster is locked and loaded.
Give them hell.
Damn right.
Two minutes till the helo drops.
Everybody okay?
All right, Kerns, take a left.
I want you to go over three blocks, then you go about five blocks...
I want you to go over three blocks, then you go about five blocks... ...hang a right, and straight.
-That should get us to the evac site. -Yes, staff sergeant.
-I'd hold on if I were you, Lockett! -Copy that!
-We got hostiles. -What's going on?
-Let's not wait around and find out. -It's gonna be okay.
Got about 250 rounds, staff sergeant.
Know what they say if you hit a deer?
-Speed up! -Damn straight!
-Come on! -Y'all hold on!
We're gonna have to go right through them!
-You saw that? -They're going down like bowling pins!
Kick it out!
Run that sucker over, man!
Santos, you okay?
I got that nasty stuff all over my mouth, man!
-It's not funny. -You let him do you on the first date.
-Everyone okay? -Yes!
Let's get us home.
Cease fire!
-Stay close, stay close! -What are we doing?
Load them up! Our flight path won't be clear much longer!
You're in the middle of the shit, sergeant!
What happened to all our air?
Pulled back to save our assets! They were blowing us out!
We're abandoning Los Angeles!
Let's go, Imlay!
Son, you okay?
All right.
Let's move! Move, move!
Come on, Harris, let's go!
Hold on!
-You all right? -Everybody all good?
-Girls? -Everybody okay?
Hold on tight!
What happened?
Pilot said something was playing hell with our power!
Staff sergeant! Nine o'clock!
Santos, you said you were tracking massive RF signals?
Could a concentration of them knock out power?
Yes, definitely! Why?
Could be their command-and-control center!
Get me down there!
What?
I gotta recon that area!
No way! It's a suicide!
Damn it, we're the only ones left! All the other forces have fallen back!
We can't land! May not have power to take off again!
This is a letter for Martinez's wife.
Will you get it to her?
Yeah.
Hover at 40 feet!
-Twenty seconds! -Roger that!
Come on, Adukwu, let's get this off.
Staff sergeant, what the hell are you doing?
We're in the clear! We're almost home, Imlay!
You're in charge now!
You get these civilians home safe!
You're the bravest Marine I ever seen, Hector!
No!
Everybody, take cover.
I told you to stay in that helo.
Civilians are free and clear. We were worried about your ass.
I think the command-and-control asset is nearby.
Kerns, how many klicks to that blackout?
It's about five klicks, staff sergeant.
Five klicks. All right.
We're gonna use this overpass for cover.
If we take out those drones...
...our military might have a chance to get back into this fight.
Santos...
...where would you put a command and control asset if you wanted to protect it?
-Underground. -Let's go.
Everybody, let's move. Come on. Move, move, move.
Move.
They must've gone back up. Just leads up to the street.
I thought they were leading us to the command-and-control center.
Damn it.
Let's go. Back.
Holy shit!
Santos!
They know we're here now.
That's their command-and-control.
Everybody out now! Move, move, move! Follow me!
Up here! Up that ladder, go! Move, move, move! Up that ladder!
Let's go! Move it up! Blow that grate, Imlay!
Move, move, move!
We're right over their command asset.
That's it, all right. Let's move the concrete slab, 1 o'clock. Let's move.
Fire in the hole!
That should give us a couple minutes.
Laser target, staff sergeant? We don't have any more jets, though.
They can fire ground-to-ground missiles from Edwards Air Force Base.
We radio in a strike, paint the target with the laser.
-Aye-aye, staff sergeant. -Hoorah.
Our best chance at radio reception is on top of that building...
...but it's the most exposed.
I'll do it, staff sergeant. I'll make the call.
Santos, you got those codes?
Air Force strike package coming up.
You get to high ground. Once you radio in, they'll track that signal.
Things are gonna get real hot.
So once you make that call, you get the hell out of there, all right?
You know what that means?
We're gonna have to hold those things off till the strike gets here.
Bingo. Marines...
...we make our stand here. Let those bastards know who they're fucking with.
-Retreat.... -Hell!
Two-Five.
-Right of the heart, right? -Right of the heart.
They're gonna be coming up from there. Take two.
Plant one there and the other one on the other side.
-Keep your head down, get it done. -Doc, watch your back!
Watch your head! Watch it!
Any station, this is Foxtrot-Two-November, do you copy?
Any station, this is Foxtrot-Two-November, do you copy?
Foxtrot-Two-November, this is Yankee-Tango, over.
We have a priority fire mission. We've located an enemy command center...
...under grid 885-342.
We will be lasing. Code 1-2-0.
I say again, we will be lasing. Code 1-2-0.
Copy that. Time to target, three minutes.
Staff sergeant!
We got three minutes! It's coming in three minutes!
All right. Let's paint this target.
Hell of a shot, Kerns! Get your ass out of there!
Get out of there, Kerns! Shit.
-Shit! -Kerns!
Shit! Shit!
Doc, Doc! Get to cover now! Move, move!
Shit.
Contact! Twelve o'clock!
Covering up front!
-Go, go, go! -Go on, get in there!
Shift fire left! Shift fire left!
Right there, right there!
Got it!
Sixty seconds left.
-Lockett! -Shit!
Let's go!
Back in the fight, Santos!
-Need a little help! -Covering!
Imlay, use your grenade launcher!
-I got it, Doc! -Covering!
Where's that goddamn artillery? Should've hit by now.
Doc, let's go!
-Doc? -Imlay! Imlay!
Incoming!
Yes!
Santos, we got it! We got it!
Direct hit! Direct hit!
Staff sergeant, you did it!
Yes, we got it!
The strike package. It went through?
-It came through? -Yeah! All right, Kerns!
It's over.
It's coming up. It's coming up.
They're trying to get away.
The goddamn thing can fly, staff sergeant. It's flying now!
I'll get you out!
We gotta protect the laser. Come on. Come on!
Santos!
Son of a bitch!
-That hurt! -Cover me, Lockett!
The drones are pulling it away! We gotta take it out now!
Incoming Copperhead!
They're using the drone to protect the ship!
I'm running low on ammo!
Santos!
-How is he? -He's hanging in there, staff sergeant!
Crazy bastard. You should've left me there.
Covering!
Grenade!
-Staff sergeant! -We are not dying here, Lockett!
You damn right we're not dying!
It's getting out of range! I gotta take it down!
Doesn't have enough punch! Save that shot!
Staff sergeant!
Lockett, you okay?
Harris, you're gonna be okay.
There's the last Copperhead.
Santos, take out that drone!
Firing!
-Yeah! -We did it!
We did it!
We did it!
I can't believe it worked!
Yeah!
Staff sergeant, you did it!
There's nothing controlling the drones anymore!
Marines, on me!
They're retreating. Advance!
You guys saved our lives out there!
Semper Fi, Two-Five!
-All right, Two-Five! -Retreat, hell!
You kicked ass, staff sarge! Welcome home!
-Move! Move! Move! -Good work, Marines! Outstanding.
Your civilians are safe.
Word of how you brought their ship down...
...is going out to every army in every city.
We're mustering up whatever troops we can get and going back in.
So get out of that gear.
Get some chow in you.
There's breakfast in the tent.
You earned it. Hoorah, Two-Five.
-Get some smoke, Imlay. -Got you.
Got grenades over here. Anybody need?
-Got frag rounds coming down. -Imlay, I think you could use this.
-Got it. HE rounds. -I need a couple more magazines.
-Very nice, very nice. -Everybody got ammo?
Yes, staff sergeant.
What do you think you're doing, staff sergeant?
We already had breakfast, sir.
I'll be borrowing this, sir.
Carry on.
-Retreat, hell! -Hoorah!
This is Bullpen 2-3. Who's with me?
Morning, Bullpen. Dog Pound 2-1, on your left.
Good to hear a friendly voice, Dog Pound 2-1.
Liberty 1-1, Snake Eyes joining the fight.
Yankee-Foxtrot-2-1, we're on your 6.
SOLDIER [ON RECORDING]: Falcon Main, this is Bravo Team.
Falcon Main, this is Bravo Team. Do you copy?
Storm incoming. Zero visibility. Request immediate support.
Falcon Main, something's in here with us. Send immediate support.
Falcon Main, this is Bravo Team. Send immediate support.
MARSHALL [ECHOES]: Ma'am. Ma'am. Marshall.
Ma'am. Marshall. Link found something half a klick ahead.
Bravo Team? Think so.
Axe. With Steeler. Man the 50. AXE: Yes, boss.
With Steeler. Man the 50. AXE: Yes, boss. All right, ladies. Saddle up.
She's a woman, but she still manages to make that sound like an insult.
Get used to it. [ENGINE REVS]
Captain. You see those markers?
Yeah, I see them.
Do you have any idea what they are?
Sergeant Davis, I'm a Ranger, not an archeologist.
Copy that.
Axe! What?
Axe! What? What are you listening to? George Jones.
What are you listening to? George Jones.
Who the hell's that?
You're a philistine, Steeler. Yes. Yes, I am.
Damn, Marshall. You got hella reflexes.
Fifteenth casualty today.
Killing them. Take no prisoners, Davis.
♪ Ssh, white lightnin' ♪ Link, what'd you find? It's definitely Bravo Team.
But the tracks end here.
What were Bravo Team traveling in? Up-armored Humvee and a M-ATV.
That's 10 tons of armored vehicle. They don't just disappear.
They don't just disappear. Boss, we've got something.
Incoming. On your 12.
Where did that come from? Out of nowhere.
Bravo Team reported a storm in their last transmission.
Hostiles using it for cover? An ambush. Like in Helmand?
Let's not find out.
REDCON-1. If there are hostiles hiding behind that storm,
REDCON-1. If there are hostiles hiding behind that storm, things might get kinetic.
Copy that.
Marshall, what are you doing, bro?
In case I get my head blown off, they can still tell who I am.
Ha-ha-ha! Hardcore shit, cabrón.
MARSHALL: Goddamn, that shit's close!
Link, you ever seen lightning like this before?
No. Never.
But I feel pretty secure here in this big steel box,
holding my metal gun.
Dash, on your 12! Look at those markers!
What the hell is that?
Watch out! Damn it!
Brace yourselves!
Where the hell are we? And what happened to the storm?
What the hell just happened?
ARTEMIS: Hey! Guys!
You okay?
Ugh, I'll survive.
Did we just get hit by lightning?
Steeler, you good? Never better.
Where did all this sand come from?
ARTEMIS: This isn't right, none of it.
What the hell is that?
I don't see any structures or mountains marked on this map.
According to this, the nearest sand dune is 20 klicks away.
How's that possible? AXE: Where the hell are we?
How did we get so far from the road? I don't know.
Axe, get on one of those dunes and set up an observation point. Yes, boss.
and set up an observation point. Yes, boss.
ARTEMIS: Steeler! DPV will run. She's had worse.
Marshall? GPS is fried, boss.
Radio and sat. All I get is static. Even the compass is screwed up. Must've been the lightning.
Even the compass is screwed up. Must've been the lightning. Well, what do you wanna do?
Go analog. Navigate by the sun.
Make it back to base. We hoof it if we have to.
Boss, that's a long hike.
Yeah, well, we keep going till we get comms.
Then AWACS will call in support. They'll send helos, maybe armor.
ARTEMIS: Nice. Back in business.
ARTEMIS: Nice. Back in business. AXE [OVER RADIO]: Boss. Send it.
AXE [OVER RADIO]: Boss. Send it. There's something you gotta see.
Up-armored DPV and a M-ATV.
It's Bravo Team.
V-formation. Move out.
What do we do about them? When we get comms,
What do we do about them? When we get comms, we'll call in recovery assets to retrieve the bodies.
What happened to them? Flamethrowers.
I don't think so.
Never seen a flamethrower do this to a man.
Not even napalm burns that hot.
Ma'am?
It's glass.
Glass? When sand melts, it turns to glass.
How do you melt sand?
I don't know.
This shit is officially above my pay grade.
Looks like they made a stand.
Let off a lot of rounds. They didn't hit anything.
Let off a lot of rounds. They didn't hit anything. There's no bodies.
Maybe they took the bodies with them?
I've seen that before. LINK: Yeah.
I've seen that before. LINK: Yeah. Well, that's just the thing. What do you see, Link?
Well, that's just the thing. What do you see, Link?
Nothing.
No tracks anywhere.
Whoever did this, they didn't leave a mark.
We need to get moving. Move out!
Dark Star to Falcon. Dark Star to Falcon, over.
Damn it. Lightning really messed up the electronics, huh?
Not just the electronics.
What do you mean? This isn't right.
Nothing about this is right.
That lightning, it did something to us.
Captain knows what she's doing, all right?

We need to get back. We need to get back home.
Stow it, Sergeant Davis. Oh, God. We're gonna die here.
Shut that shit up right now, soldier. That's an order.
You see what it did to Steeler and Axe?
Dash, hey. I got three. You?
What? Three mags left.
What does it matter? Did you see that?
It matters because we're soldiers. And this is what we do. We fight.
Am I right? Rangers lead the way.
You with me? Always, boss.
You're all crazy.
You know, I don't care what the hell that thing is.
We do what we do best. We fight and we survive.
No matter what the odds. You got it?
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.
You got it?

You said that before. What the hell is a Rathalos?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Don't thank me yet.
Enjoying the show?
What?
[MEOWS] What is that? Palico.
My friend tells me I misjudged you...
that I might even owe you an apology.
Just don't hold your breath.
Why did you put me in chains? What are you so afraid of?
Your world...
and what it could do to mine.
You aren't the first to cross over from your world.
There were others. A long time ago.
That's how you speak my language?
Mmm, I made a study of it. What happened to me?
Mmm, I made a study of it. What happened to me? How did I get here?
I believe that the answers we both seek lie here.
At the peak of that mountain lies the Sky Tower.
Remnants of an ancient civilization.
Very advanced. Very dangerous.
It is said that the Ancients knew how to travel between both worlds.
I believe that is the purpose of the Sky Tower.
That is what brought you here.
What happened to this ancient civilization?
They destroyed themselves. Their technology turned on them.
You think my world had something to do with it.
I suspect. But an open gateway between our two worlds
I suspect. But an open gateway between our two worlds was catastrophic once.
I intend to make sure that doesn't happen again.
We were on our way to investigate the Sky Tower
when we strayed into the Diablos.
That's where I lost my friend here.
Tending to the wounded and repairing the ship was our first priority.
But now we resume our mission.
The Ancients would guard their technology with the most fearsome of creatures,
a Rathalos.
Almost impossible to kill.
Their only weakness is just before they breathe fire.
You help us with the battle ahead,
perhaps we can help you get home.
What's the matter?
You don't have cats in your world?
Hey!
You been drinking from my mug again?
We leave at dawn. And don't keep me waiting.
I hate waiting.
So? You ready?
We got a hard climb ahead of us.
LEA: Come on!
We believe that the lava powers the machinery within the tower.
It's controlling the storm.
Exactly.
It's creating a gateway to your world, but it looks unstable.
Let's go.
Rathalos.
Prepare yourself.
Remember, they're weak just before they breathe fire.
Hey, ugly!
It's okay! It's okay. You're safe now! Get the medic!
Captain Artemis?
Let's get her inside! Up!
Let's go! Let's go!
[DISTORTED] Captain, we've been searching for you.
What the hell is she wearing?
Falcon Main, this is Red Wolf.
PILOT [OVER RADIO]: We've made contact with Dark Star.
We have a lone survivor.
I say again, a lone survivor.
Ground forces are securing the area. Copy that, Red Wolf.
Captain.
Can you hear me?
[ECHOING] Can you hear me?
Captain? Captain Artemis?
Where are the rest of your men?
My men? Yes.
[IN REGULAR VOICE] Where are the rest of Alpha Team?
OFFICER [OVER RADIO]: Copy that.
ROARK: We're under attack!
Aim for the belly!
THE ADMIRAL: A Rathalos.
Load!
Fire!
No! No!
No!
It's coming right for us!
Evade!
My God.
Come on!
I got you.
My friend.
[IN ALIEN LANGUAGE] Thought you might need a little help. Yeah, I... still don't understand you, man.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, thank you.
I don't have any more chocolate.
Think fast.
You're here. We came to help.
We can't have monsters from my world attacking yours.
It's starting again.
We don't have much time.
There's going to be another attack.
We have to get back.
We have to shut the Sky Tower down.
(PEOPLE YELLING)
(PEOPLE YELLING)
Yo, Jimmy, man. Give me the status. Tell me we good.
JIMMY: You got it, man. Beautiful.
It's gonna be an all-timer tonight.
All right, all right, all right, fire them up!
We go live in five!
It's time for ignition and straight automobile pimping.
Girl! Sorry! My bad!
All right, ladies! We're good.
We're good.
That's it, babies.
(JULIUS SPEAKING SPANISH) Come on, Tej! Let's get this race going!
Whoa, whoa, man. Wait a second, man.
You cats are first wave, man. Where's your fourth at?
You cats are first wave, man. Where's your fourth at? It was Joaquin, man, but he had to work the graveyard shift.
TEJ: What? Graveyard shift, man.
Why don't you run with us, Tej?
Hell, no, I'm not running with y'all, man.
And I tell you what, either you find a fourth or you don't race. How about that?
We should find two, so we don't have to roll with skirt here.
(SUKI AND JULIUS ARGUING IN SPANISH) Whoa, wait a second, wait a second.
Why don't I just find y'all a fourth
and we settle this on the streets?
Bring him on. Anybody I want? (SPEAKING SPANISH)
No matter who it is? Yeah.
BRIAN: Yeah.
Yeah, man. You want to race tonight?
Yeah, you know I could use the money.
You got four minutes, man.
All right. I'll be there.
The race starts in four minutes.
All right, girls, let's do this.
You think you're gonna win, baby?
What do you think?
You better. We got rent to pay. I know this.
(SPEAKING SPANISH) I'll get you when you get a car worth racing.
There's our fourth right there.
Shit. It's Brian.
What's up, Tej? What's happening, dude?
Thanks for the invite. No problem at all, man.
Just remember me when you wax, all right?
They got deep pockets?
Real deep.
What's up, Suki? What's up, Bullitt?
What do you say we kick it a nickel?
(SPEAKING SPANISH) Nobody said nothing about raising the stakes.
If that's the case, why don't you ask these nice people here
to back off the line so you can go home.
Okay. $3,500.
$3,500?
Either that or you can go home, bruh.
It's all there. TEJ: Better be.
Damn, Suki, when are you going to pop my clutch?
As soon as you get the right set of tools.
Yeah, all right. All right.
All right, back up, back up. Let's go, let's go.
Yeah, yeah. Back y'all asses up!
Back up. Back up before you turn into barbecue around here.
It's not a game. This is serious.
All right, back up, back up. Get off the street. Off the street. Let's go.
Back it up, back it up. Everybody keep your heads real, real clear, all right?
'Cause I got a surprise for y'all this evening.
Go, Slap Jack! Go, baby!
I got this. I got this.
Ready?
Go!
Oh, hell, no!
You ain't passing me, dawg, you ain't passing me. Come on.
What you got, man?
I told you, you weren't gonna pass me!
Move, bitch!
Not tonight, baby!
Bend over, boy.
Damn, girl!
Last turn, last turn.
Too wide.
Home stretch, baby.
Got to go, dawg!
Yes!
I can smell you!
Yo, Jimmy, hit it, baby. Hit it.
All right. Y'all see that?
I told y'all I had a surprise.
How you like that for a finale?
Bridge.
Shit!
Oh, hell, no!
Smack that ass!
Yes!
Tell me I saw that, man. Bullitt and Suki sprayed the bridge.
I need to start making y'all pay to even see this shit.
I got over $10,000 for my man right here, all right?
That's what I'm talking about, man. Play with it.
Smells good, don't it? Yeah, how about that, right there?
Right, right, right. Y'all see this?
Everybody take a real good look.
This is what you call mutual respect. All right, let's clear out.
Anybody down for another race?
Shit.
Hey, make sure you bring that body by the garage later
so we can work on that front end of yours.
Watch out.
Maybe I will.
Where are you going?
It's time to get out of here. Why is that?
Nissan Skyline! Got him!
Shit! Shit! Shit!
Shit.
(GLASS SHATTERING) Damn!
Let me see your hands! Put them up!
OFFICER: Yeah, this is him. We got him.
So, how long you been in South Florida?
A while. Before that?
We know you're Brian O'Conner, formerly of the LAPD.
Man, you got the wrong guy. Really?
BILKINS: How you doing, O'Conner?
Let's take a walk.
MARKHAM: Carter Verone.
Born in Argentina, but he's lived most of his life in Miami.
Now he owns the biggest import-export business in the state.
You see, unfortunately, the cartels have been successful
You see, unfortunately, the cartels have been successful getting drugs into Miami.
But they've had a hard time getting the cash out.
We've been surveilling him for a year.
But we've never been able to put him and the money together.
We've swept his house, his warehouses... Nothing.
Customs here has done a great job of getting us this far.
I'm just here to help get them over the top.
I was able to get an agent in undercover,
working travel and logistics for him.
Recently Verone put her in charge of finding some new drivers.
Right, although we can't confirm her status right now.
You think she's flipped? She's one of mine. She's all right.
She's been in with Verone nearly a year. Even lives at the compound with him now.
Look, it was the FBI's idea to bring you in here. I'm against it.
But we need some good drivers that can put this asshole and his money together.
You're gonna roll with Agent Dunn here.
And if I don't?
Here's a list of the laws you broke in L.A.
Obstruction of justice, aiding and abetting. You know the rap sheet.
We can make this all go away in the interest of justice
if you're willing to play ball. Yeah.
So what's the idea here? Dunn and I are supposed to be street racers?
That's right.
So, Dunn,
looks like we're going to be partners, bro.
Could you tell me, what would be a better motor
for my Skyline, a Gallo 12 or a Gallo 24?
Twenty four.
I didn't know pizza places made motors.
See, man, come on, I can't do this.
I mean, seriously, if this is what you're gonna give me,
I may as well take my chances in Chino.
BILKINS: We'll get someone else.
BRIAN: No way, man.
The only way I'll do this is if I get to pick the driver.
All right, O'Conner. Who you got in mind?
This dude I grew up with in Barstow.
Who's that?
Roman Pearce.
(CAR ENGINES ROARING)
That your boy in the Monte Carlo? BRIAN: Yeah, that's him.
Yeah, he's got some skills.
And he's crazy as hell, I'm telling you.
In a good way, though. He's the man for the job.
And he's got quite a record, including three years upstate.
Says here, he's on house arrest now.
Can't go more than 100 yards from his home.
(ANNOUNCER CHEERING ON LOUDSPEAKER)
He always said he'd be famous.
BRIAN: Pearce!
Roman Pearce!
Yo, whatever happens next, just let it go.
I ain't in it.
(WHISTLES) Rome!
Only my homeboys call me Rome,
pig.
I'm not a cop anymore, bro. Is that true?
Blondie here is not a cop anymore?
That's true. No badge.
BILKINS: Here we go.
You still fight like shit. You still fight like shit.
You better chill.
What the hell are you doing here? BRIAN: I'm gonna choke you.
I told you to stay away from me.
You should have told me. I did three years, Brian.
I told you it wasn't my fault.
Why did you come here, O'Conner?
I got a deal for you.
When I needed your ass, you were nowhere to be found.
Now you're trying to hand out deals?
I need you to come to Miami and drive with me.
If you do, they'll take off that anklet and they'll clear your entire record.
I did three years in jail.
Three years in jail over you, Brian.
I know you better than you think.
Maybe you don't.
Maybe you don't.
You guys finished?
This deal legit?
That's right. If you do this job for us.
I told you. Shut up, punk.
So you're gonna clean my record
and get this thing off my ankle.
That's right.
I thought you couldn't wander more than 100 yards from your home.
Why do you think I'm parked so close to the derby?
Man, quit playing like you're gonna pass this up.
You stupid...
Wait. Hold on.
Bro, what's going on?
I don't know if I should be trusting you, man.
Just think of it this way. It's an opportunity for a fresh start.
Now, let's just go do this, all right?
I wouldn't need a fresh start if it wasn't for you.
Man, you've been using that since the day you got busted.
Now, let's just chill out and go do this.
I don't need to chill out.
Yes, you do.
And you need to stop blaming me for your every mistake.
And Roman Pearce needs to start taking responsibility for his own actions.
You need to go to hell. And you need to go back to Barstow.
I'm not going back to Barstow.
Brian O'Conner, Roman Pearce, meet Monica Fuentes.
Do they have background on Verone? They've been briefed.
Good. All right, here's the deal.
Verone's looking for drivers. I've arranged for both of you to join up.
I've also hired some thugs, you know, to make it legit.
When do we start? Right now.
What are we driving?
Don't even think about taking the convertible.
It might loosen your mousse.
That's cool. That's too much chrome for me anyways.
Damn! Where do you all confiscate these rims from, man?
Check in with us after you meet him.
You think you're gonna have any problems with these two knuckleheads?
I can handle them.
If they give you any trouble at all, you let me know.
Thanks, Markham.
I ride with you, cowboy.
Why she gotta ride with you?
You get the convertible. Let's go.
Turn right here.
So, you used to be a cop? Yeah.
How long you been under?
I lost track.
You all right?
You might want to keep your eyes on the road, playboy.
What, you think we're gonna crash?
I haven't decided yet.
What are you doing, Brian?
He did the "stare and drive" on you, didn't he? He got that from me.
MONICA: Once we get in here, you're on your own.
Look at that one.
Where'd you get them cars? At the bottom of a cereal box?
Real funny, Fonzie.
Ass.
Roberto, Enrique, I need pictures of the drivers,
their license plates, their cars, and anything else you can find.
Let's go.
Keep your mouth shut and follow my lead, all right?
I got this. No, I'm serious now.
Handle your business. I'll handle mine.
Watch your hands, bruh.
ENRIQUE: Go in line.
Let's go.
Carter.
The drivers are here. Good.
Come on.
Stay.
(SPEAKING SPANISH) What's going on here, bro? Tell me.
What's going on here, bro? Tell me. Thank you for coming on such short notice.
My red Ferrari was confiscated yesterday
and it sits in an impound lot in Little Haiti.
It's about 20 miles from here.
The car isn't important. What is important
The car isn't important. What is important is the package I left in the glove box.
The first team back here with the package
will have an opportunity to work for me.
What are you saying? We got to audition?
Nobody's got a gun to your head.
That's it.
Driver's licenses. Pass them up.
Before Christmas, guys.
Let's go!
Come on, cuz!
All right, let's see what this thing can do.
Agent Markham. I've got them heading south on I-95.
Yeah, I got it.
They're running. What a surprise.
Come on, stick with me, Rome. What you got?
Why must I chase the cat?
Smart-ass.
Oh, yeah, you think you're the bomb, Rome?
Let's see if you still got it, Brian.
All right, Rome, I got something for your ass.
Watch this, bro.
Shit.
Damn, Rome, how do you like them apples?
Show-off!
That's the Brian O'Conner school of driving right there, baby!
Crazy-ass white boy!
Shit!
RASTA: Bumbaclot.
WOMAN: You better get yourself out of the street!
That's some bad shit, man.
What do we got?
That's good. Show me his partner.
Cars, cars. Where are the cars?
Stinking boats. Where are the cars?
Come on, I need the cars. Where are the cars at?
Look in the center. Look in the center. What?
Cha-ching!
Now put your blouse back on. Hater.
PEARCE: Shit!
Don't let him get away. Not a problem.
(POLICE SIREN WAILS) Sit on it, Fonzie!
What the hell?
Shit. Cops.
What the hell are they doing here?
BRIAN: Rome, no!
Time to go.
Son of a bitch!
MONICA: Juvy record for popping cars. Two years in J.D.
Then another year for aiding and abetting an armed robbery.
He's clean. Dirty, but clean.
All right.
Hey, man. You got something to eat up in there?
We hungry.
Sit them by the pool.
Nice. Come on.
What are you checking her out for? I'm not checking her out.
Yes, you were. No, I wasn't.
I seen you checking her out, man.
Okay, I was. Now shut up.
You shut up. Don't tell me to shut up.
Both you girlies shut up. Unbelievable.
You sure are cozy in this big old mansion.
Sleeping with the enemy.
No, no, no, no. Sit down.
Nice Ferrari you got in the driveway.
I'm glad you like it.
Darling, will you hold that?
We did all that for a damn cigar?
No. You did that for a job.
Do you really think that I would let somebody impound my car?
The boatyard is mine.
By the way, you two owe me a gate.
I'll just take it off your cut.
Off our cut? Yeah.
I like that. Good.
What's this job you got for us, anyway?
Come with me.
The house has ears in it.
I have something I want you to carry from North Beach to the Keys.
What is it?
What is it? Just put in the car what I tell you to and drive it to me
Just put in the car what I tell you to and drive it to me
and don't let anybody stop you. Understand?
Yeah. Any chance of cop trouble?
No, I'm buying you a window of time
but it's not gonna be open very long.
You make it,
and I'll personally hand you $100,000 at the finish line.
Make it $100,000 apiece, papi.
Look, man,
obviously
your pockets ain't nervous. Hey, hey.
Don't ever touch me. Ours are empty.
Like I said,
we hungry.
I got an idea. Why don't you two boys
I got an idea. Why don't you two boys join us at the club a little later tonight?
Yeah. Pearl at midnight?
Get to know each other a little bit better.
That sounds good.
We'll see you tonight. See you.
Hey, you!
Your pockets aren't empty. Damn.
I'll take my cutter back.
Stupid ass.
Hey, man, I figured you had like 12 or 13 of these.
You're not too bright, are you?
Just get out of here. Get out of here.
Same old Rome doing the same old stupid shit.
Get off me, man.
Get off me, man. Look, running your mouth? Insulting people? Stealing Verone's shit?
Look, running your mouth? Insulting people? Stealing Verone's shit?
You think I'm gonna let somebody stare me down?
I didn't let nobody stare me down in jail, homeboy.
You think I'm gonna let it fly on a beach?
"And you, I'll take my cutter back."
His rich ass.
And you're packing. Like you ain't.
Exactly.
From here on out, I do the talking.
You want to do more than that.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you're always getting in trouble over a female, Brian.
BRIAN: Man, Tej's garage is ridiculous.
He's got the best of everything.
Snap-on tools. All these lifts are brand new.
They're only maybe a couple of months old.
Hey, yo, Jimmy. What's up, man? JIMMY: Hey, what up, Bullitt?
JIMMY: Hey, what up, Bullitt? That's Rome right there. Do me a favor.
When you get a second, I want you to check out the Evo and Spyder.
Make sure everything's copasetic.
Evo? Where'd you get an Evo from?
It's a long story. I got you, man.
Thanks, Jimmy. Come check this out.
Man, it's so hot and humid, I can't even wear drawers.
Man, tell me about it.
Look at all this potential out here.
Ray, don't do that, man. You're making me lose money.
Come on, stop that. I know you're better than that. Come on.
Damn.
Girl, you know your boy can help you put that fire out! Look at the bubble on that.
Let's go. That's serious.
Come on, Ray, you're making me lose money.
Don't do that. Don't do that to me right now.
Come on, Ray. Do it.
Tej Parker? This is Roman Pearce.
Basically, he's the man to know in Miami.
Basically, he's the man to know in Miami. He's got his finger in absolutely everything.
It's just the way it is. Come home to daddy. Come on now.
What's going on, Suki? What's up, baby?
How you doing? I'm good. How you doing?
What's this? What's the latest?
It's a work in progress. It's not finished yet.
That's some artistic shit. You got talent, girl.
Ray, it's do or die right now! Bring it home, Ray! Bring it home, Ray!
Yeah, baby!
Pay up! Pay up! Pay up!
Pay up, everybody.
That's how they do it out here, man?
Every day. That's crazy.
Right here. Right now. What's up, man? You don't look too happy.
Expeditiously, man. I need it quick. What's up? Thank you. Thank you.
How you feeling, man? You all right? Thank you.
Not too bad.
I see you're about your money, homey. You race, too?
No, man. I hit a wall doing like a buck 20 a couple years ago.
Ever since then, I've just been organizing and collecting, man.
Hey, Tej, check it out. He's gonna be in town for a while.
Is there any way he could use that cot?
What's wrong with your place, man? No.
I don't want to stay with him. He got bad habits.
All right, man, whatever. Show him around. I'll be up there in a minute.
Thanks. Sure.
All right, who wants a chance to win their money back?
So, Jimmy? So, what's up, you ever seen anything like this before?
No. Both of them are wired like I never seen before.
What?
Yeah, man, they got us wired with GPS.
That's why Markham knew we were gonna be at that impound lot.
Yo, you the master mechanic. Why don't you just yank that shit out?
I'll try, but this ain't LoJack.
The DIS box, the engine management system, hell, the main harness,
the GPS is spidered into all of that.
Hey, tell me something, man.
Do I even want to know where the Skyline is, dawg?
Or where you've been the past couple of days
or where the hell you got these rides from?
They're hot. Yeah, they hot.
They wired so hot that whoever's tracking these things
would know every time you don't wear your seat belt.
All right, Jimmy.
Just do what you can do, bro. I got you.
Thanks, man.
Man, we need to get these on the street ASAP.
Hey, bro, check it out.
See that Cadillac across the street over there?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, they've been on us ever since we left Verone's house.
Elian and Fidel!
Hey, man, can I clean your windshield, buddy?
What are you doing, man?
PEARCE: Is everything copastetic, homey?
Kiss my ass.
Shit.
PEARCE: Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
He's gonna blow our cover before we even get started.
Bilkins, tell me what went wrong?
That's what I want to know.
Show me your hands. Come on, keep them up!
Show me your hands. Come on, keep them up! What's this about, man? What's going on?
What's this about, man? What's going on? Hold this. You think you can shoot at me? I'm a goddamn federal agent.
Hold this. You think you can shoot at me? I'm a goddamn federal agent.
What are you talking about?
Get your damn hands off me! Get him away from me, dawg!
Just 'cause you wear a badge doesn't mean you can mess shit up for us, homeboy!
Get your hands off me!
You're lucky I didn't shoot you! Shut up!
Don't tell me to shut up, Brian!
You almost blew our cover, old man! I'm right here.
You shouldn't have shown up like you did.
You didn't know Verone was testing us?
No, I thought you punks were running! Running?
That's great. That's real great!
And if Rome wanted to shoot you? You wouldn't be here right now.
All right, we got to get this under control.
That's mine!
So?
Tell me what you know.
Rome and I will be making a run for Verone.
I'm not sure when or where,
but he did say that he bought us a window,
I'm assuming from the local cops.
I can talk to some of the guys at the local P.D.
No. No good. If Verone's got some of them on the payroll,
then we can't let them know our operation.
Exactly.
In addition, Verone told us that he himself would be waiting at the drop.
That's good news.
If you're gonna be delivering drug money to him,
then we can get him for laundering.
Now, there's only one problem. What's that?
Fuentes.
Verone's tapping her. Tapping her?
Tapping her how? That is crap.
Now what you talking about, homeboy? We know what we seen.
So what do you think, O'Conner?
You think she's compromised? You should know.
What's that supposed to mean?
Your old pal O'Conner didn't tell you?
He flipped on Bilkins in L.A.
He gave his mark his car keys and let him disappear.
That's why he's not a cop anymore.
So what do you think, expert?
Man, I don't know.
All right. We'll keep an eye on her.
We're out of here.
Let your man go?
Drop it. I don't wanna talk about it.
Drop it, hell. I want to hear about this, homey.
I said, forget about it, cuz.
We got Fuentes in with Verone,
Markham trying to blow our cover,
and we got two wired cars that are no better than that damn ankle bracelet of mine.
I'm gonna tell you, bruh,
you let Markham do that shit again in front of Verone,
that's gonna be our ass!
I know, man. I know. It's just getting thick real quick.
We may need a way out, we got to come up with some kind of an exit strategy.
Exit strategy? Yeah.
I like the way that sounds. What you got in mind?
I don't know, man. But we need two more cars.
Yeah. Here they come.
Fonzie and Fabio. Glad you can join us.
We heard you boys wanted to get rid of those Cracker Jack toys.
No, actually we just figured those cars you got
deserve better drivers, which is why we're gonna take them off your hands.
You know, why don't we settle this now?
Wait, wait, wait. How about we settle this on the blacktop?
Each car does a down-and-back, tag-team style. For slips.
Loser walks home.
We came to race. Load them up then.
Come on, bro, let's get these cars.
All right, check it out. There's no way we're gonna beat these guys straight up.
That Hemi's putting out about 425
and that Yenko will snap a speedo in about five seconds flat.
We're gonna have to pull something out of our ass.
The only thing I can think of is save the spray for the way back.
The return trip.
Done deal. All right, let's do this, bro.
I'm getting that orange one.
You ain't ready, Fabio!
TEJ: All right.
You each got a barrel to go around down at the end of the road here.
Second wave's got to sit tight till your partner crosses this line right here.
First team to go down and back twice wins the race.
At which point,
the losers will hand over them keys.
Otherwise you'll be eating breakfast through straws from now on.
I get it.
This means you, too.
I got it.
All right. Let's race.
Come on, baby, you got this, Rome! This dude ain't serious.
Yeah, you gone, homey. I got this. This is done.
You about to lose your car.
Do it, Rome! Come on, bitch, you got it, man.
You think I'm worried about this fool, man? This is nothing!
Oh, no. American muscle.
Your engine ain't as big as your mouth.
Got to smoke him. Got to smoke him, got to smoke him.
All right, here we go!
It's all right, baby, I'm gonna handle this. Handle it.
Ready, and go!
You ain't ready! I run these streets!
Romey Rome! You ain't heard of me?
Oh, shit.
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.
Where's your big mouth now?
That car's going home with me, homey.
Shit. Eat this, sucker!
Shit!
Yeah, boy! Go, Korpi!
Sorry, blondie, how does that dust taste?
I don't know.
Come on, Rome.
What the...
Good move, kid. Let's see if you got the balls. Come on.
Come on, Brian, bring it home, man!
We got two new cars!
Damn!
Y'all ain't ready, homeboy! Get to walking, Fabio!
Use them bus tokens, partner!
Hey, how you doing? Good. What's your name?
We're guests of Mr. Verone's.
It's a hoasis in here, bruh.
Yeah, lots of potential.
Damn. You got a pen?
It's about to get serious, bruh.
PEARCE: Look at that girl on the swing right there.
Hey, you guys did something right.
Verone never socializes with hired help.
Now what's that make you?
Where's he at? He's on his way.
You and Verone don't go everywhere together?
What's that supposed to mean? Nothing.
I'm gonna go take a piss. You go do that.
What is his deal?
He doesn't trust people who carry badges.
So you talk like you know.
I'd been a cop about two months
when Roman was busted in a garage raid.
He had eight sets of wheels in his possession, each one of them hot.
So you busted him?
No, I didn't even know it was going down.
But that doesn't really matter to him.
Basically, once I became a cop,
Roman saw me as a friend who became the enemy.
Is there anything I can get for you, Mr. Verone?
Just tell them to come join me.
Oh, yeah. I was admiring this.
Damn.
I wasn't about to give it to you. Good.
What's up? He's here, man.
Where's he at?
He's over there. Don't look.
Excuse me, Mr. Verone would like for you to join him.
Let's do it.
See what I'm talking about?
It's all right, let them in.
Go sit down, I'll talk to you in a second.
How you doing? Good. Enjoying your night?
Yeah, I'm having a good time. Good, good.
She's beautiful, isn't she?
Yeah.
She's gorgeous.
You got balls, kid.
I can appreciate that.
Women are a very powerful force.
You see the blonde sitting with the gentleman right here?
Five minutes of her time, and she can get anything she wants from him.
I love your hair.
Watch.
I wonder where they're going? Sit down.
So you lit my man's car on fire. Is that right?
Yeah.
I did.
You see, I got a problem with authority.
I have that same problem.
For me, it's cops in particular.
Let's take a walk. Come on.
We just got here. And now we're leaving.
Let's go.
Come on.
What's all that?
We're going to have a little fun.
MONICA: Thank you.
It'll be fun. Let's stay longer. Let's get out of here.
Hey, Carter.
Meet Detective Whitworth.
One of Miami's finest.
Thank you, sweetheart.
You enjoying yourself, Detective?
Yeah, I was.
I mean, you know me.
Yeah.
You've been on my payroll a long time.
Verone, that ain't right. Shut up.
I've got one last job for you, Detective. You hear me?
Look, we've been all through this. Yeah?
Look, we've been all through this. Yeah? Yeah, and I said I can't do it.
That's the wrong answer. The table.
(WHITWORTH GROANS) I'm a detective, Verone!
You do anything to me, the whole force is gonna be on your ass in a minute.
Shut your mouth, you fat piece of shit.
Stop right now.
What the hell? What the hell is that?
Sit down.
You're going to regret this. Stop right now!
You're going to regret this. Stop right now! Once the bucket gets hot enough, Detective,
the rat is gonna want out.
And the only direction it can go, is south.
Hold that.
Get it off me!
Shut up.
Did you know that your average rat can chew through a steel drainpipe?
You see, you have nothing to worry about when he's screaming, Detective.
It's when he goes quiet that he goes to work.
WHITWORTH: Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
You can't be this stupid! Stop it now!
You're in charge of the units that are watching my properties.
You're in charge of the units that are watching my properties. What I want is, I want a 15-minute window
where everybody, and I mean everybody, disappears. You hear me?
I can't do it! You can't?
WHITWORTH: Stop it.
Okay. Monica, come here.
WHITWORTH: Help! Help!
Shut him up. Shut him up.
Help!
It's biting me!
(MUFFLED CRIES) What?
Got something you want to say?
It bit me. Jesus.
WHITWORTH: I'll do it! Do what? Say it.
I'll do it. I'll give you your window.
WHITWORTH: Just get it off me.
Get it off!
You betray me,
and my rat here
is gonna visit your wife, Lynn,
your son, Clay, and your daughter, Lexi.
Do you hear me? Do you understand me?
You hear me? Get it off.
I'll burn your fucking eyes out! I'll burn them out.
Now, you can go.
Get rid of him. Let's go. Get it off.
You boys enjoy the show?
Fifteen minutes, and then every cop in Florida's gonna be on you.
Be at Versailles Cafe at 6:00 a.m., day after tomorrow, ready to drive.
You understand? Yeah.
Don't play games with me
or you'll be next. All right?
Help yourself to a little champagne. Let's go.
That was a damn rat, man.
You ever touch another man again, and I'll kill you.
You hear me?
Look at me. You hear me?
She was into it, man. What's that about?
You seen the way she grabbed the dude's head.
She had to, man. He was testing her.
You got to remember, her ass is on the line, just like ours.
You're feeling this girl way too much.
She's like that crazy-ass trailer rat from back in the day, Tanya.
Tanya? Man, you went out with her after I did.
I mean, I couldn't let it go to waste.
JIMMY: I got you. I got you. I got you.
Is that right?
(RAPPING) We go race for cash, but when I step on the gas,
my nitrous go blast, leave your ass in the past.
Tej, you about to lose your garage.
Whatever, man.
I'm a low-budget mechanic, but I overcharge.
Pay me! Let's go, man.
Pay me my money. I told you, man.
I'm glad you're happy man. I'm so glad. This is my garage, boy.
Royal flush. Give me this, man.
You got to talk to him, talk to him.
Damn, you can't play and play it for long.
Put that money back on the table. You know it's mine next hand.
Jimmy, how are you gonna pay me back if you keep losing to Tej like that?
How you doing, bro? Real good.
I'm going to crash, Tej. I'll catch you tomorrow.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here? Brian, they're gonna kill you. I heard him telling Enrique and Roberto.
Brian, they're gonna kill you. I heard him telling Enrique and Roberto.
Once you finish the run, they're putting a bullet in your head.
You sure you heard him right?
I'm sure. I'm sure.
(KNOCK ON DOOR) Verone's boys is outside...
I see what they're looking for. Your little girlfriend here.
They don't know I'm here. I snuck out.
What the hell are they doing here then?
I don't know. Maybe they're guessing.
Go stall them. Go stall them for, like, two minutes.
Check her, homey. Check her.
Found what you're looking for?
Hey, buddy. Hi, guys. How you doing?
Y'all still mad about y'all car?
Don't even trip, homey. Come on, man, can't you take a joke?
All right, this isn't about being a good cop anymore or doing your job.
They're gonna kill you. You guys gotta pull out.
Verone pay y'all to keep a straight face like that?
'Cause if I was making money, shit, I'd get that mole removed off my damn nose.
Okay? Yeah.
How much he pay y'all anyway?
Every time I see y'all, man, y'all got the silk shirts on,
jewelry, you know, looking real Miami.
I caught you walking up in the club,
you got the hamburger meat all hanging out.
Don't make that run, Brian. Don't make that run.
Be careful.
Where are you going? You stay right here with us, buddy.
Don't even think about it.
Stay your ass off my homeboy's boat.
Put the gun down! Put the gun down now!
You first, asshole! You first!
I'll shoot the shit out of him! Now, put the gun down!
Put down the gun now!
Put down the gun!
Enough. Enough.
Shut up. Shut up.
It's over. Come on.
VERONE: It's over. Let's go.
It's our gun. Come on, let's go. Let's go.
I'm glad to see you boys are getting along so well
because tomorrow, Roberto and Enrique are gonna be riding along with you.
Just so we don't have any problems.
I'll see you guys in a bit.
What the hell was she doing in there, man?
Where'd you go this morning?
I went to breakfast with some friends.
With friends?
I do have friends, Carter.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
Nice shirt, Bilkins.
It's my day off. Yeah.
Well, anyhow, this is the deal.
Last night, Verone threatened a cop into giving us a window.
We're driving to an airstrip in the Keys, off Nallwood Avenue.
Verone has a plane there and he's taking off for good.
Wait a minute. How do you know this?
Monica.
She's doing her job. She warned us.
She warned you about what?
Verone plans to kill us after we give him the money.
Driving into an ambush was never part of the deal. I'm calling this off.
Like hell you are. This is a Customs case, Bilkins.
No one's calling this off unless I do.
Look, this is real simple.
You make the run, you get Verone and his cash together,
You make the run, you get Verone and his cash together, so I can move in for the bust.
You don't, I'll file enough charges on both of you to make you disappear.
Take these.
Take these. We're gonna have GPS on you the whole time so you don't get any cute ideas.
We're gonna have GPS on you the whole time so you don't get any cute ideas.
And to make sure nothing happens to them, right?
Yeah, right.
That guy's a dick, man.
Let me get this right.
If we don't do this, then we go to jail.
But if we do it, then Verone's going to kill us.
It's a hell of a deal, huh? Yeah.
Maybe it is.
I know this guy's got an ass full of loot that he's ready to dump in our cars.
And I can think of two reasons why Verone doesn't need that money anymore.
Here we go.
You and me.
Just like the old days.
What do you think?
What do you think? I think they messed with the wrong two guys, that's what I think.
Yo, Tej, what's up, bro? TEJ: What up?
Hey, man, how quickly can you organize?
TEJ: Look, if y'all really want to carry out this plan,
this is definitely the best place to do it. So what do y'all think, man?
I think it's perfect. So, what do they store here?
Man, this thing is clean.
Distributor cap.
Jimmy, do we have any half-empty bottles of nitrous lying around?
Sure, but I've already loaded you for spray.
No, I'm thinking we may need it for something else
'cause our cars may get a little crowded, you know?
Man, when did you start eating so much?
I was in jail, bruh.
I know how shitty the grub is on the inside.
With the way things are shaping up out here right now,
it'll be a matter of time before I'm back in there, or dead.
So I'm trying to eat all I can while I can.
Plus, the doctor tells me I got a high metabolism.
Man, you remember us growing up?
You know, playing football in the dirt?
You know, getting into trouble. All the stupid things we did?
When you got busted, you know, whether I was a cop or not,
you know, if there was anything I could have done,
you know, I would have done it.
I just want you to know that.
Is that why you let that dude go in L.A.?
Yeah, I think that had a lot to do with it.
When I got busted
it wasn't your fault.
It was all on me, Mr. Roman Pearce.
Wild and out. Crazy man.
No one could tell me nothing.
Riding solo.
Yeah, well, not anymore.
Not anymore, bro.
I've got Verone's Navigator leaving the residence.
Copy.
Sir, we've got Verone on the move to the airstrip.
Good. Let's get a bird in the air. Tell him to keep his distance.
AGENT 1: Ready to go. AGENT 2: Thanks.
You're all set. Thanks.
All set? Yeah. Let's do it.
Report.
WHITWORTH: What's going on out there?
Team One, checking in.
Team Two, checking in. Team Three, checking in.
AGENT 1: Team Four, all clear here, too.
AGENT 2: Team Five, checking in.
AGENT 5: Team Six, all clear.
PEARCE: Here we go. BRIAN: Yeah, so you know what to do.
BRIAN: Stay cool. Keep focused.
Remember the airstrip's off Nallwood Avenue.
It's the third exit after the bridge.
Got it.
So, what up, man, you ready for this?
Come on, man. Guns, murderers, and crooked cops?
I was made for this, bruh!
ROBERTO: Come on.
I got activity at Verone's trailer property.
Do not move an inch until I tell you to!
Load up.
All units,
move on the trailer property. Right now! Move!
Shit. Local P.D. is moving in on our guys.
Three bags in one car? Guess so.
The cops.
I'm not going back to jail.
Where are you going, man? Let's go! Let's go!
What is he doing?
Okay, now let's get the chopper over them. I want eyes right on top.
You got it.
Lima 2-5,
follow GPS.
Do you know what you're doing, man?
Stay with me, Rome. Stay with me. Come on, man.
PILOT: I've got them heading south on I-95.
Bring in the aerial ESDs.
Oh, shit!
They're catching up, man! Shut up, man!
Nice driving, Rome, nice driving.
I got you, Brian.
Check it out!
What was that?
Oh, shit!
Come on, man. Take the wheel. No, no, no, no. I can't drive.
Just hold the wheel! Put your hands on it. I can't drive!
Just hold it steady. Just like that.
What are you doing, man?
Yeah, man!
Hold.
Bilkins, the bird's in place.
We've got Verone's Navigator.
All right. Money's in transit. Sit tight.
You're a good driver, man.
Thanks, bro.
We've got the area blocked ahead. They've got nowhere to go.
What was that?
MALE PILOT: I've got a visual.
Video should be coming through.
I got it. Looks good.
Where are they going?
Shit.
All right, Miami's finest, let's see what you got.
Come on. Stay with me, boys.
Hey, man, everyone's here. Time for the show.
Let's give it to them.
All right, let the party begin. Let's go!
This is unit 25-99. We have the suspects surrounded.
Holy shit!
It's a scramble, baby! A big one!
Yeah! Let's do this!
Check this out.
We're not tracking them on video.
We must have lost them in the scramble.
Yo, let's break.
Yeah!
All right, we got them going west on Beach.
Roger that! I've got them!
Customs has a fix on two cars going west on Beach.
Roger. Follow those cars.
Roger that.
Shit.
They're cornered.
POLICEMAN: Keep your hands where I can see them!
Hands up!
Hands up! Whoa, fellas, fellas, I know my tags are out of date, but damn.
What the hell?
Where are they?
How about them apples, man?
Yeah! That's some driving for your ass, baby!
Ain't that some driving for your ass?
Good job, man.
What are you talking about, man? Whatever, man.
You're supposed to be a stone-faced killer!
You over there were grabbing your seat belt!
Hey, Tej, thanks a lot, bro. Man, you're clutch. I owe you one big time.
Yeah, Brian, you really do owe me, man. You really do...
Us.
Suki says you owe us, all right?
Yo, Rome, you there, man? Come in. What's up, man?
It looks like we got just one more trick left.
My pleasure, buddy! Let's do it, baby!
Maybe we should grab Verone while we still can.
No! Not yet!
MARKHAM: What?
You lost them?
Shit!
Those little pricks are running!
It's your call. What do you want to do?
We're gonna take him down. He is not leaving here.
Enjoying the ride?
Man, it's a fast car, huh?
It's a classic. Old school.
American muscle.
Man, this car can do all kinds of things. Want to see?
Check this out right here, homey.
Hey, what are you doing, man?
(ROBERTO YELLING) Ejecto seato, cuz!
It worked! I love this button!
PEARCE: Stay on your toes!
Mr. O'Conner, it worked, baby! Blow and go. I'm all clear.
Meet me at the point! Hurry up, man! It's on, baby!
All right. 10-4, man.
Are you ready? Let's go!
Let me see your hands! Let me see your hands!
AGENT 2: Freeze!
AGENT 3: Clear!
MARKHAM: It's not Verone and Fuentes.
What do you mean, not Verone and Fuentes?
Then where the hell are they?
Get off at Tarpon Point.
Tarpon Point? There's no airstrip at Tarpon Point.
Who said anything about an airstrip?
Brian?
Brian, man, what's the hold-up, bro?
Yo, bro. There's a new plan. What the hell?
We're meeting him at the Tarpon Point exit, not the airstrip.
So, what are you saying? Like I said, there's a new plan.
Brian?
Brian? Hello, you there?
Damn!
Yo, what the hell is he doing?
The feds are in the wrong place.
Brian's woman is on her own with Verone.
So...
So Brian's not coming!
It's all right, let him out. Get out.
Pop the trunk.
Hurry up.
Where's the rest of it?
The other car. Another car?
Where's the other car? On its way.
On the way? Yeah.
Here's your money.
So you know nothing about the agents that stormed my jet?
The funny thing is, I only told one person about the airstrip.
Customs agents sure are getting pretty, aren't they?
Put her on the boat.
Let's go. Get on the boat.
Hide the cars and get rid of him.
Back in the car.
End of the road.
You know, I like you.
But I still got to kill you. It's my job.
What's that?
What's that? PEARCE: It's Barstow, baby!
It's about to get ugly!
Let's go. Let's go.
Come on.
You had me.
You slipped.
Eleven and a half months, and you slipped once.
Put her downstairs.
See you in a second.
I thought you was dead, man.
Yeah, me, too. Thanks for saving my ass, bro.
What are you doing, Brian?
I don't know, but if Verone sees a helicopter or Customs boat, she's dead!
PEARCE: Boat.
Car. Boat.
You're not gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
Yeah, I think so. You got my back, bro? Yeah.
Yeah, I think so. You got my back, bro? Yeah. All right, put on the seat belt.
Show him some Dukes of Hazzard shit!
We're gonna do this big! Hold on, Rome! Hold on!
Brian, you're crazy, man!
What the hell are you doing?
I think I broke my arm, man.
Get the gun.
It's over, Carter.
You okay?
Yeah!
I'm great.
We got him, man.
We got him. Let's get out of here.
WOMAN: That ought to do it.
So, there were three bags total? The three from the boat?
So we're good, right?
Our records are clean?
You held up your end.
Your records are clean.
So maybe there were six bags.
I guess we can call it even.
Agent Dunn? Sir.
We found some more evidence.
Come on, let's take it to the truck.
Don't drop the soap, big homey.
I hope you know that when he gets out, he's going to kill your ass.
He ain't getting out.
I'll see you soon.
You think he's going to get out? He'll be out.
Not for real. You think he's getting out, dawg?
We took care of your decoys. They're free and clear.
There's a sedan out on the road for you.
Try to bring it back in one piece.
Thanks a lot, Bilkins. You're all right.
Thanks. Thanks for looking out, man.
Do you trust me now?
You're all right.
Sorry.
Nice working with you, O'Conner.
Same here.
I might have to stay here in Miami, and keep you out of trouble, bruh.
You know what I'm talking about.
You're going to kick it in Miami, bro?
Oh, man, I love Miami. Miami is off the hook!
Open a garage together.
A garage? How are we going to do that, bruh?
I know what happens when you die?
You become a ghost...
trapped in a shadowland.
A world of whispers,
invisible except to other ghosts.
Orphaned,
unable to return to those you loved.
But with loneliness...
comes freedom...
...to go where you please.
Do what you want.
Ghosts have one power above all others:
to haunt the living.
Haunt them...
for what they've done.
345-Tango-Tango.
Tango-Tango, we have engine failure.
Shit, shit, shit!
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
Going down!
This is the day I died three years ago...
as far as anyone else knows.
There was no eulogy. No wake.
I became a ghost.
But this isn't where the story really starts. No, no.
That was four months ago, on my team's first mission.
And that was a glorious clusterfuck.
-[woman 1] It didn't fucking work! -[woman 2] One? Five for One.
God, I hate these numbers.
-[man 1] They're for your own safety. -[man 2] Get in the car.
She's, uh, she's bleeding.
-[woman 2] I'm aware. -[woman 1] Drive!
-[man 2] Gonna smoke these motherfuckers! -[engine revving]
[man 2] They're shooting at us!
-[woman 1 groans] -[man 1] Go, go, go!
-We're gonna need a hospital. -[man 1] Getting a little tense in here.
Where did the guys come from?
-You said you were covering the door. -I was covering the door.
-You were shot through a window! -Such an amateur show.
-Oh, an amateur show? -Yeah!
I know, you got shot through the window. God, that's so bad.
[woman 1] What lawyer has this many guards? You're definitely gonna die.
I don't know, a lawyer with friends in high places.
-Mafia friends or something. -[woman 2] Mafia?
The point is we got this. That's all that matters.
-Yeah. What's that? -It's... It's disturbing.
Gonna hurt, okay?
I'm gonna go in really deep and find that bullet.
No, no, no. Don't. No, you're not gonna put that in her.
-[woman 2] Oh, I'm in. Feel that? -[woman 1 exclaims]
-[woman 2] Shit. -Oh, God. There it goes.
Oh, that's so gross.
-[man 2] Oh, I'm gonna yak. -We got a tail.
Stop playing with your fucking gun, and let me work.
[woman 1] Shut up. You wanna die?
Hey, I think they got us. You wanna...
Yeah, here we go. Hang on.
-[engine roars] -Okay.
-It's a little tight. -[tires screech]
[woman 1] Watch out!
What did you guys do in there? Why are you covered in blood?
The head, neck, and face are very vascular, so it's a lot of blood.
[man 2] Oh, please tell me you didn't kill a mafia guy in Italy!
Fuck... off.
No.
I'm trying to help you here.
And anything beyond a simple "yes" is gonna just super suck for your face.
Look, your client is a half-wit, fuckstain war criminal.
Why are you protecting him?
My client has never ordered any gas attacks.
No, he's ordered the four generals that work for him to order the gas attacks.
Just get him on the phone.
Let's just fucking get nuts.
What do you say?
-Client privilege. -[laughs]
You're gonna be a pirate.
-[man 2] This is getting blood on my car. -Shut up!
There's a BMW chasing us.
[man 2] Can I take a moment to thank you?
There is nothing else I'd rather be doing with my life.
I don't care.
Go, go!
-[man 2] Oh, nuns, of course. -[nuns scream]
They'll forgive me.
What the fuck?
Watch out for that--
[slowed] Ohhh...
Oh, I so had the right of way.
You hit one more person, and I'm walking.
-You hear that? -A lot of backseat-driving going on.
Nice call on the Day-Glo green.
-[Six] Is it too flashy? -Blends into the Italian architecture.
-[Six] What, you don't like this color? -Baby, baby!
[slowed] No, no, no, no! Puppies!
[slowed] Fuck!
She's fine. She's fine.
Uh, he's got a gun.
-Move! -What?
-Jesus! Shoot him! -Go get him!
[Six] Do it!
She okay?
-She's lost a shit ton of blood. -This isn't a shit ton.
[Six] Oh, it's leaking under my seat!
I am judge of what's a shit ton. You see? Blood. Red.
Can you just staunch it or whatever the fuck you call it?
I can actually hear it pumping out.
She squirted.
-That was literal... She squirted. -That's a lot of blood!
Tell me that didn't go in your mouth.
Guess this happens when you try to steal a whole country. Right, One?
Yeah, we could have used a warm-up mission.
Yeah, that's my problem. I'm just getting warmed up.
[One] Oh! Fuck!
Oh!
Why is everyone on a fucking Vespa?
-[woman moans seductively] -[Six] Whoa.
God, I love Italy.
I'm starting to feel it.
I'm feeling fucking carsick.
One for Four?
[man] Yeah, go for Four.
[One] We need you.
[Four] 'Course you need me.
I'm here.
Remind me, where the fuck is "here?"
[Four] "Here" here. Like, here?
Specificity.
Here.Right effin' here!
Top of the Duomo, like we talked about.
Look up.
Where you going?
Oh, shit.
Coming down.
I see you.
Punch up.Pit maneuver!
Right over you!
Coming north. Down on Via de... Via de...
There's so many fucking vias in Italy.
Wrong way!
Come back. I've got an idea.
Round the corner.
That's it. Keep coming, keep coming.
-Six, you see that? -[woman speaking in Italian] -That's called "skill." -[in disgust] Oh!
Who knew the optic nerve was so long?
Surprised his asshole didn't come with it.
This isn't gonna work. Pull over there.
[Six yelps] Ah! What the fuck, dude?
-Aargh! No! -Okay. Don't...
Don't you squish it, you motherfucker!
-Grab it! Got it? -I'm fucking serious!
-You squish it, the mission's over! -Get it!
-Dude, come on! -Got it!
-Oh, fuck me! -Got it!
-Toss it! Toss it! -Keep your goddamn eye on the road!
This is so stressful.
-[Six] Whose eye is that? -It's-- It's the lawyer's.
-[Six] Did you just scoop it out, or-- -God, no! I didn't scoop it out.
-Two did. -[beeping]
[One] Okay, here we go.
Okay. All of Rovach's transmissions.
Gonna lead us straight to the four generals.
-I'm getting light-headed. -You're not the one holding it.
[Six] You got the generals? Can I go?
-[siren whoops] -Cop.
-Cop. -Don't you move.
-[Five] There's a cop looking right at us. -[beep]
-Go, guy. Go, go, go, go! -[engine roars]
You gotta lose that police chopper.
[in English] Yeah, hey. Shit's gone... We're super fucked.
Well, I could probably point you to il bagno.
Whatever. Four needs an Uber.
Way ahead of you, papi.
Go, go, go!
[One] I'm gonna send new exfil.
As soon as we get clear, lose the chopper. Can you do that?
-Lose the chopper? -"Can I lose the chopper?"
Go, go, go, go, go!
-Shit! Shit! -Fucking drive!
You fucking drive!
[Two] Get down.
-Is your arm hurt? -What? You wanna fucking shoot?
Then can you use it to shoot back?
-You seeing that? You seeing that? -Yes! Yes!
Don't tell me my job.
-Hey, remember the Uffizi? -Fuck, no.
It's the museum next to where we got those mochaccinos.
I remember the mochaccinos! I'm saying fuck, no!
Punch him.
-[Six breathing rapidly] -Sorry for yelling.
Mind if I turn on some music?
♪ If you wanna be my lover ♪
[One] Just watch out for the people!
Okay, where in the fuck is the front door?
Gun! Gun, gun, gun, gun!
-♪ It's time to stand up, stand up ♪ -Two!
[softly] Oh, fuck!
Glad you're on the team.
Me too.
[Six] You said whatever I need to do, right? So, I'm just gonna do it.
-We're definitely gonna be on the news. -No shit. Hang on.
Shit!
No, no, no, no, no!
That was Apollo and Daphne!
You see any choppers? I don't see any choppers.
Three, lost the chopper.
Not the David. No! Not the David, not the David, not the--
[Six] Is the David the one with the really small...
Yep, that's it.
You wanna get out and compare, or should we maybe think about going?
-No. I'm good. -Yep. Let's go.
Go!
Oh, shit! Two black Suburbans coming your way.
Six, fake 'em out. I'm coming to you.
Go, go, go, go, go!
They're expecting, "Go, go, go!"
[Six] You got a superhero on the squad!
[in English] I don't speak that.
[Six] Shit's about to get crazy.
Now? I'm conducting surgery.
-I'm trying to lose a thousand cars. -She's gonna die, you know?
You can live for days with a gunshot wound in the stomach.
-She'll be fine. -[yelling in Spanish]
No. Don't speak that either.
Up top!
[Five] Oh, I feel it, I feel it.
I got it, I got it.
[Two] Oh, I feel so much better now.
[Five] I got it, baby!
Yes! Now, that's driving! That's driving!
What the heck?
I can't see!
Whoa, shit!
Oh, shit!
[One] Okay.
Okay.
Come on.
Go, go, go!
Where's--
[Three] Here's a toast to a kid I liked.
Are you crying?
[Three] We didn't even know his name.
[Two] We don't know any names.
What was his name?
It doesn't matter.
He was a good man.
Thought I managed the risk. I'm sorry.
Did he have a family?
I think you're looking at it.
All of us.
We're not a family.
Not the Cleavers.
What?
The Cleavers.
Ward, June?
-What? No. -[One] Leave It to Beaver.
-[Two] Leave It to Beaver? -[One] Jerry Mathers?
-No. -[One] Tony Dow?
-No. -Barbara Billingsley, Hugh Beaumont?
-[Two] Never heard of it. -No? Nobody watches Nick at Nite?
[Two] The French don't watch shit like that.
[One] Millennials, French people. Let's just grab the head.
[Four] What does this mean?
It means we find a Seven.
[man 1] Central, Aid and Base.
[man 2] Aid and Base, this is Central. The net is yours.
[echoing] Jackpot.
[man 1] We got a van stepping out. United Nations.
[man 2] ISR is approaching coordinates.
[man 3] Black Hawk, got eyes on the white van?
He looks agitated, man.Something's wrong.
He's headed for my guys, and I don't like it.
I said he is headed for my guys.
My guys... [echoing]
Looks like the letters are backwards.
I said the UN is backwards. Request permission to fire.
[man 4] Maybe you haven't heard, we're spectators here.
-[sniper] Commander-- -[man 4] Unless you wanna
suck on a court-martial, I suggest you pull up a chair and spectate.
[soldier] The van! The van!
RPG!
[sniper] Dear mister and missus,
you may not know me,
but Johnny's one of my Delta brothers; a friend.
[One] Welcome home, Blaine.
We've been looking for a special operator like you for a while.
Who are you?
I'm somebody who'd have let you pull the trigger.
Excuse me?
I listened to your call.
Never mind how.
I would've let you pull that trigger.
Can I come in?
Thank you.
Nobody's gonna save the world.
But we can make it a little less shitty, you know?
And I'm the guy who can help you do that.
You wonder what it would be like if you could do the job that you were put on this Earth to do?
Hmm?
You could take out some truly evil people.
Not people that the government tells you are evil,
because based on, you know, policies or politics and bureaucracy
or trade relations or any of that shit.
No, I'm talking truly world-class evil motherfuckers.
I can help you go after those guys.
And I will never tell you to not pull that trigger.
What would you say to that?
[man, echoing] Hey, kid!
-[man 1] Hey, what's that guy doing? -[man 2] Don't do it!
Hey!
[echoing] Man overboard!
[man] Blaine was a born operator,
a fourth-generation soldier.
As a matter of fact, his family fought for us since the Second World War.
And like those before him, Blaine believed in right and wrong, in knowing the difference and then doing something about it.
in knowing the difference and then doing something about it.
[through earpiece] He told me stories...
he heard as a kid about his grandfather.
A Tuskegee airman killed in action in 1944.
He would like that we're here,
placing these photos together...
-[bell tolling] -...at his hero's grave.
[man 2, through earpiece] And he damn sure loved his country, like Captain America. [chuckles]
And none of us know how we would react
if we were put in the same position he was.
[through earpiece] The fear, the noise.
But if I was Blaine,
I would've shot the motherfuckers. I would've blown their fucking heads off.
That's just me.
I would've been the last man standing.
And I don't have any military background, but I'm like a mother duck.
You get in the way of my ducklings--
-[sobs] -[man 3] Man, just sit down.
Just... Just sit down.
-[sobbing through earpiece] -You should have seen him watching Coco.
Puddle of tears.
It's an emotional movie.
[Blaine] He's really heaving.
God, that's hard to watch.Okay.
I think we've seen enough.
From now on, you will be known as Seven.
I'm One.
So, there's seven of us.
No, six.
♪ And I ♪ ♪ And I have been programmed... ♪
[One] There's this trick that we all do to get through our day.
We take a box and into that box, we place all the horrors of the world,
all the wrongs humans do to one another.
And then we close the box and pretend it doesn't exist.
Only some of us spend too much time inside the box.
We've lost our ability to pretend.
We know there's too much unfinished business in this fucked-up world.
in this fucked-up world.
Our job as ghosts is to do the dirty work the living can't or won't.
And we do it from here.
This is our haunted house.
It's a lot like the Batcave, except it's nothing like the Batcave.
Seven, you're dead.
You're gonna be restricted to cities that you've never visited before.
People that you've never met.
All, of course, except your fellow ghosts.
None of whom you'll know by name, only number, for safety,
and so no one gets too close.
Walk over here.
This is our target hit board.
These nine men have been placing too much shit inside the box.
So, now, they answer to us.
Target number one: this prick.
First mission:
the dictator of Turgistan, Rovach Alimov.
When you're dead, you get to stop all the bullshit.
No more DMV lines, no more shopping Christmas...
Or backstabbing girlfriends.
[Five] They should make an "Out of Office" reply for dead people.
"Sorry I'm away from the planet right now.
I'm fucking dead."
No more tax, no more criminal records,
no more getting arrested by the pigs just for being naked or just usual stuff.
You know, being naked, getting drunk. Casual stuff.
[Five] Know the best part about being dead?
-[Four] Mm. -[Five] No more immigration lines.
Don't look at me like that. I'm fucking American.
I'm illegal.
You guys sure are cynical.
How about high blood pressure?
Fuck you, high blood pressure. I'll eat whatever the fuck I want.
Thank you very much.
You realize you're actually still alive, right?
Fuck you, too, technology.
[One] What they don't know is I've been making magnets
[One] What they don't know is I've been making magnets since my seventh grade science fair project,
which I completely dominated, by the way.
I figured out how to take big stuff like this...
This is pure shit.
...into this.
I came up with neodymium, micro magnets.
Equal vibrating phones, ten million cell phones...
-[cell phone ringing] -...Priuses, Teslas, all use my ingenuity.
And someday, this will make me very, very rich.
You guys, you got it all wrong, you know.
Best thing about being dead...
is the freedom.
I mean, we're all gonna die.
May as well do it while we're alive, right?
When you're young, you lock yourselves into all of these bad decisions.
You know, marriages and mortgages, and all that kind of stuff.
But you die...
it's all erased.
Poof! Gone.
From that point forward, all that matters is what you choose.
The point is that we should bring Seven behind the curtain.
You wanna hand me those over there?
Here we go. All right, a little demonstration, no technology.
This is how to stage a coup in three not-so-easy steps.
All right, you got a country, Turgistan, yeah?
These are the people, nice people, going about, doing their thing.
Then you got the four generals, cuatro cunts, very bad guys.
But there's one worse guy.
That's the piece-of-shit dictator.
Right there at the top.
Don't forget his brother.
[Three] Democracy-loving brother.
He's the key.
So, we're gonna hit the four generals. They're gonna lead us to the brother.
You kill top generals, you fuck a dictator's day.
The second thing we're gonna do is free the brother.
The last thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna say goodbye
The last thing that we're gonna do is we're gonna say goodbye to piece-of-shit dictator and hello to democracy-loving brother.
to piece-of-shit dictator and hello to democracy-loving brother.
It all goes down in four months.
El Día de los Muertos. The Day of the Dead.
Oh, that's it?
Oh, well, that's pretty simple, you know?
It's cups.
[sucks teeth] So, we're all gonna die?
Not me.
She's not.We all are.
-Painfully. -[Seven] Yeah, y'all are funny.
So, what else can you tell me about this guy Rovach in Turgistan?
[reporter 1] On the Turgistan border,
hundreds of thousands are fleeing Rovach's reign--
[reporter 2] Military targets the aid work--
[reporter 3] Rovach's military targets these secret hospitals.
[reporter 4] As the world sits on the sideline--
A million people have been displaced since the conflict began.
We have over 80,000 in this camp alone, nearly half of them children.
-Heartbreaking. God. -Yeah.
I'd love to show you the hospital we just built.
We're not gonna go to the hospital.
I'm a little behind on my malaria pills, but--
Malaria's not an issue in this part.
I'll be the judge of that.
Here's what we're gonna do, though. Okay, I'm gonna...
-What's your name again? -Oliver.
Oliver. Oliver here is gonna take a picture of us right there,
and then I am going to take some shots of some kids, hopefully not too sick,
and then I am going to take some shots of some kids, hopefully not too sick, nothing too depressing, no amputees.
nothing too depressing, no amputees.
-Then I'm gonna carry some... -[shutter clicks] ...you know, water jugs around,
and then I'm gonna cut your foundation a giant check.
-Okay, what's your name again? -Mike.
Yeah, okay. Thank you, Mike.
Watch out there.
-Please, let me help you. -It's balanced.
If I dropped one, -I'd just walk around in circles. -[shutter clicks]
What's that rich guy doing here?
[man] I don't know. Photo op for social media?
Showing he cares?
I should've been a soccer player. I could've gone pro.
-Get out of here. We're good. -[laughs]
-They're gonna hit us! -What's going on?
Come with us! We gotta get the masks!
-Get the masks! -Gas! Gas!
-Get the masks! -Gas!
-[One, in English] Go open the boxes. -[man] Pass them out.
[One] Put that on. Put this on.
[man] We're in the Louvre. In the most beautiful place in the world.
Shut it off.
But, sir...
-Where did you find this? -Social media, sir.
It's everywhere. News outlets and foreign governments are greeting it
It's everywhere. News outlets and foreign governments are greeting it with universal condemnation.
[reporter] He is a war criminal that no one holds accountable.
His worst atrocities involve banned chemical weapons.
Such a fuss.
It's all perfectly bloodless.
Who do you think shot it?
Impress me.
You shot it, had it shot and leaked,
to communicate resolve, inspire fear.
Show my enemies what's in store for them and for those they love.
It's only the beginning.
[woman] Thou wast provoked by thy foul mind,
which never dreamt on aught but butcheries.
Say that I slew them not.
But dead they are, and devilish slain by thee.
[male actor] Why dost thou spit at me?
[female actor] Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake.
[male actor] Never came poison from so sweet a place.
[female actor] Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
[male actor, muted] Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
[female actor, muted] Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!
Martini.
Stirred.Not shaken, stirred.
[One] What's your opinion?
I'll take a Negroni.
Just poured.
Sorry?
On the... On the play?
There's that old cliché, "Does art actually imitate life?"
'Cause you got this tyrant who's walking the stage--
[Rovach] Baasha.
And, uh, in the first act,
his cruelty goes completely unpunished.
But in the fifth...
In the fifth... justice.
Always justice.
[Rovach] You see a tyrant.
I see a man bringing order to a disordered world.
Scouring its filth, polishing it till it shines.
In art, our most fervent hopes come true.
Heroes always win.
It's bullshit.
In life... totally different.
Nah, I'm with Shakespeare. Act Five's coming.
-To Shakespeare. -[One] Mm.
To Bill.
I think you both just spoiled the end.
No.
We didn't.
[chuckling] I didn't catch your name.
-Rovach. -No, I was talking to her.
Do you mind? I can feel the tip.
Yeah.
He's no longer inside me. We're safe.
What is your name?
Arianna.
Arianna. Big guy's still staring at me, isn't he?
-Yeah. -He's gonna kick my ass later.
-Good. -Yeah.
[One] We must be doing something wrong.
[Arianna] Why?
'Cause the chocolates have lasted the whole night right there.
-Like they're glued there. -[giggling] That's crazy.
I'm getting old.
Do you believe what that man said?
Evil goes unpunished.
I believe he believes it.
And what about you?
I just feel like the whole world's, like, on an...
endless, evil... shitty loop.
But he'll get his.
You know, this was fun.
Are you ghosting me?
Do I look like a ghost to you?
No. It's like the things you say, it sounds like you want to be.
-The things I say. -Mm-hmm.
But what makes you think that I want to see you again?
You weren't that memorable.
Besides, I'm moving to New York.
That's where I live.
Sucker.
So, now you're stalking me?
Maybe a little bit.
-[One] And now you're all caught up. -[ticking]
[woman on TV] Anything happen in school today?
Angela Valentine said she was going to get sick in class.
[woman] What happened?
She did.
-Hey, what do you know about One? -[Four] He loves Wally the dog.
He's obsessed with this Beaver show. I think he's an orphan.
We got a little bet on if you wanna put some money in.
It's an interesting crew you got here, bro.
How many missions you guys run?
-Counting Florence? -Yeah.
-One. -One what?
Actually, no, there was, um, this, like, mini-mission,
so maybe one and a quarter. It was in Sicily.
But Florence, absolute shitshow.
I mean, if I wasn't there, probably more than one of us dead.
I mean, if I wasn't there, probably more than one of us dead. -That's all I'm saying. -Are you fucking kidding me?
-That's all I'm saying. -Are you fucking kidding me?
I don't fuck around.
You realize I just buried myself in front of my family and friends?
Yeah, One told me about that.
Big military funeral.
Guns popping, flags.
It's pretty cool. At my funeral, there was five people there, and two of them left before the end.
It is tough watching your mum cry at your grave.
[Seven] Yeah. This mission, I got a good feeling.
This mission, I got a good feeling. I got a really good feeling about this mission.
[Seven] How come you can't find this guy?
I don't know. One can usually find anyone, but he just can't seem to find him.
He said Americans caught him a few years back.
-[ticking] -Americans?
I don't know.
[man 1, on radio] Prep your team, target...
[man 2] Camille, I get you hate this,
but sometimes you gotta put bad guys on thrones.
[woman] Just do your job.
No one touch. He's mine.
I was assured by your state department--
-I'm from a different department. -God, CIA.
I've come to deliver you to your brother.
You don't know my brother. Rovach is a monster.
He'll violate every single principle your nation holds dear.
I begged the director not to do this, Murat, begged.
The Americans caught him years back and gave him to his brother.
That bald-looking fella. You like him though, One, yeah?
He's definitely an arsehole, but a likable arseshole, no?
-No. -Well, he likes you.
Here's the fun part.
How many billionaires do you actually know?
You've heard of Elon Musk, Bill Gates, that's the... Fuck it.
Okay. Of course you haven't heard of me before.
That's how I like it. I'm a good inventor.
Created a lot of tech, tracking and hiding digital trails of people.
Some I even sold to the CIA,
where I met some interesting people, did some adventurous shit.
But slowly, I cleaned house, and I had other ideas.
Used my money to help people in bad situations.
But I realized, my billions, that's not enough.
Governments don't really help people in need.
So, I said, "Fuck the government. I'm gonna do this myself."
So, here we are. A little eyeball led us to these fuckhead generals,
and it's game on.
[Rovach] Okay, General, you're flying to Vegas.
I have a very important mission for you.
You are going to meet Viktor, the arms dealer.
Get drunk.
We're going to Vegas, baby!
[One] Viktor, Vegas, viceroy.
General Garioff, lots of consonants, so we'll make this easy.
The little fat one, he's the handler of Rovach's baby brother.
Las Vegas has more facial recognition software than any place on Earth.
Oh, I know what I'm gonna be.
Choose your disguises wisely.
I'm a grown man.I can handle my shit.
That's not how the expression goes.
Don't handle your shit, flush it down the toilet like a grown-ass man.
Be subtle. Blend in. Disappear.
[One] Okay, now it's safe.
[general 2] You mean the red one or the blue one?
-[general 3] Probably a Ferrari. -You don't see gas of this quality.
It's US Army, experimental sarin gas for testing antidotes.
Whatever's left over, they bury in the desert.
Now, I can procure it,
but you take delivery here.
And no middlemen.
Kill them all?
Love it.
-[in English] A gift from Viktor. -I love Viktor.
[general 1] Coming!
Welcome to party!
[general 4, in English] It's too late.
The deal is done.
Two tons of sarin gas.
-Where are you keeping Rovach's brother? -What?
You got three seconds. Be specific.
No, don't think, don't think. Talk!
Three, two...
Ni Hai Tower, uh, in Hong Kong, penthouse.
...one.
[One] It could be worse.
You know, he could've finished.
Good work. I said undercover, not coked-up Borg and McEnroe.
I hate this town. I really do.
No, it's Navratilova. She's a woman tennis player.
Your costume's stupid, too. Motorcycle dick.
-I'm so, so sorry, ladies. -[woman whimpers]
But what happens in Vegas...
You know the rest, yeah?
We can't.
[Three] Ow! Watch the gun.
Oh, my gosh.
-We can't do this. -What?
No kissing.
I'm cool with that.
-[Two] Stop kissing! -[both grunt]
What? I'm not kissing.
-Come here. -Nose off.
Way better.
Where are you running to?
One promised my soul back.
I just gotta talk to somebody.
You're scared.
You're such a pussy.
Ever stage a coup d'état?
No. No, I don't even know what it means.
Oh, wow.A coup.A coup d’état. It's French, Napoleon.
French history stuff.
Okay.
You can't tear a place down until you have someone to build it back up.
That someone is Rovach's brother, Murat.
Imprisoned in Hong Kong.
You see, the army's fucked now we killed the generals.
They will look for a new leader.
And we're gonna give them one.
"Coup."I don't even know what it means. Stupid word.
Oh, my favorite.
I know, Mama. How you doing?
Well, you see, Ma...
there's this country, Uzbekis... No, Turg...
Turkis... Turkikas...
Fuck! Turkikasazhan?
Ma, all I know is that it's got a "stan" at the end,
-and it's in Asia. -Oh, by Kansas!
Ish. Yes, Mama, by Kansas.
Anyway, the man who ran it died, and, uh...
he... he left behind two sons.
One good and one bad.
And the bad one came out on top.
So, what the fuck are you looking at, Nurse Ratched?
Go hang with the fucking nuns or something.
Yeah, walk.
Walk.
I will fucking knock you out in front of my mother.
Sorry, Mama.
Anyway, the two sons fought, and the bad one came out on top,
so he locked the good one up, and--
I never liked Diego.
Yeah, me either, Mama. Working for him didn't agree with me.
But I work for someone else now, Ma. We're doing good things.
Huh? We're fixing what's going on in Kansas.
Good things can erase the bad ones, right, Mama?
I love you, Andres.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, Ma, Andres is in Bogota. It's me, Javi.
-Javi. -Javi?
I won't speak to Javi anymore because he is a murderer.
Ma, it was only bad people, Mama.
[in English] Please, you don't have to do this.
No, I do. My job.
[girl, in English] Daddy?
I can't sleep.
Daddy?
He's not here.
Where's your mommy?
I don't have a mommy.
Javi loves you, Mama. Huh?
[breathing shakily, in English] You and your Bruce Wayne shit!
[One] Boo.
One rule.
One rule.
You don't know what it's like to have someone.
She doesn't even remember my name.
So, she'll never know you stopped coming.
See, you're lucky that I don't paint the inside of this car
with chunks of your fucking skull.
Jesus, who raised you, the mob?
That's none of your fucking business, Three.
We sacrificed everything to be a part of this.
Honor it, respect it. It's all we got.
I don't usually stand on ceremony, but today,
what just befell your superiors in America
undid over 60 years of loyal service to my family.
Those fine men won't be replaced easily.
Colonel Zaga, Niazo, Abdulim, Daheem.
You're next in line, gentlemen.
Your combined experience is nearly that of your predecessors,
but if my generals' shoes are to be filled,
I need men like you.
Like you,
but not you.
[Rovach] I don't know who killed my generals,
but I'd be a fool to trust the men who most stood to benefit.
So, next men up, congratulations!
[One] All right, we're gonna tiptoe through these waypoints here, under radar.
There's our backdoor to Hong Kong.
[Seven] Hey, One!
You ever plan on calling me Six?
-No. -[Seven] Okay.
-Hey, look, I know we don't get to ask-- -[Three] Then don't.
[Seven] But, uh, who is One?
-Who is he? -[Five] A rich guy who snapped. That's all I got.
-Yeah, but how did you meet him? -We didn't.
He met us. In really weird ways.
-Oh, yeah. -Yeah. Very weird,
-like, perfect timing kind of weird. -[ticking]
-[man speaking in Ukrainian] -[police siren wailing]
[in English] Cheap. Fake.
Fuck! We ain't leaving till we find the Kalahari.
Let's go.
Oh, shit.
Shit!
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!
[man] Hang on!
[woman] I'm rich.
What do you want? What do you fucking want?
Hey! Hey! Calm down.
What are you? Are you a fucking pig?
Are you afraid?
Never.
There's power in that.
More power finding a cause.
Something so important that you're afraid to lose it,
afraid that you're gonna die some other way. For nothing...
-instead of what you're fighting for. -You're making a mistake to do this.
[stammers] I'm a thief.
I've been robbing my whole f... I can make you money.
-Are you afraid? -I've got skills.
-I can be useful. I can help you. -You're gonna die now.
-I can fucking help you! -Gonna fucking die now.
-If you're gonna do it, fucking do it. -You die now!
Fucking do it!
-Oh, my God! -You sick fuck! Who fucking does that?
-You should have seen your face. -You sick fuck!
It's not fucking funny!
It's really funny.
Ooh, I never thought I'd meet a family more screwed up than mine.
Hey, no. Don't say that. He hates the word "family." I don't know.
I think he never had one.
And if you're ever left behind in a mission...
he's not coming back for you.
[laughs] What?
We Deltas don't operate like that.
Things are gonna have to change. I promise you that.
FMS, Hong Kong. Engine start.
Look, I know we're not supposed to ask, but I'm a nosy dude.
So, here goes.
You could have fought a million battles.
Why now... and why Turgistan?
Everybody talks about helping. It's nice to actually do something.
[Rovach] It is quite the view, little brother.
Personally, I'd prefer more gold, you know.
Black.
-I'm alone. -Closing on you, it's, like, dark.
You know Sultan Ahmed I?
That shit.
[Murat] In 1603, Sultan Ahmed I gave a gift to his younger siblings.
Magnificent wing in Topkapi Palace.
The gilded cage.
Yeah, I've learned my history, too.
Would you prefer the sultans before Ahmed?
Who strangled the younger brother with the same silk sheets?
You have your own library, screening room.
Yeah, it's a fun prison.
And this, what is... what is this?
Art.
Ugly art.
And the occasional visit from a loving brother.
Quite generous after you tried to take what was rightfully mine.
The throne is not yours or mine.
-It belongs to the people. -The people?
[Murat] Yes, brother, the people.
Like they're some sacred body.
Instead of a violent, ignorant, illiterate mob who just begs for the whip.
He's got his anger issues.
What are you doing here?
These shameful chemical attacks of yours,
you're making me more popular than yourself.
The only way you'll ever leave this place
is if Daqeeq here throws you through that window.
I wish.
My generals, the Four Horsemen, were just executed.
Do you know anything about that?
Do you?
These attacks on my generals
will only increase the frequency of my chemical strikes.
It may take years, but they will carve you up
for all the beautiful things you have done for these people.
Who? The US? They made me.
Russia? They armed me.
Daqeeq, seriously?
Did you buy that shirt by yourself?
You're embarrassing me.
Sorry. I have bad taste.
Daqeeq is under strict order:
If any harm should befall me, the same exact harm will befall you.
Specifically and immediately.
I'm going back to Turgistan.
To my safe travels.
[Seven] Hey, team, we're below radar.
So, buckle up 'cause it's about to get bumpy.
You know, I usually look at the stewardess to see if I should be scared.
Flight attendant.
You can look at me.
Oh, darling, you could be on fire,
and you would have the same creepy, blank expression on your face.
No offense.
You know, guys, what sucks?
If we were to crash, no one would ever know or care.
We would have no impact on anything.
Like we never existed.
[One, on intercom] I can hear you, and if you're gonna shit your pants,
[One, on intercom] I can hear you, and if you're gonna shit your pants, there's a bathroom in the back.
[One] The world is wrapped in red tape,
and I couldn't cut through it even with a billion-dollar sword.
So, we left behind everything,
everyone,
to become...
no one.
So, how long's this been going on?
What?
I've been wondering the same thing. Florence?
Nah, Vegas.
-Vegas. -[Seven] Definitely Vegas.
So, you guys know about us?
-Well, we do now, dumbass. -[Seven] Nice.
Well, I guess it's not against the rules, right?
Depends. So, are you guys fucking or making love?
What's the difference?
We're fucking.
Oh, good.
Hey. Who's this honey badger?
-I'm... I'm Raymond. -[One] Hi, Raymond.
You new to the team?
Just... Just hanging out.
It's Britney, bitch.
So, we should probably go discuss our sensitive geopolitical issues
when we're, you know, Raymond-free. Great security, though.
Really great.
Especially you.
Hong Kong, penthouse extraction.
We're gonna break out Rovach's baby brother from his 90th-floor prison.
It's a simple snatch-and-grab. Minus the word simple because it's not.
-And minus the word snatch-- -Snatch?
-Snatch. -Snatch.
-Snatch what? -Minus the word "snatch-and-grab."
-They mean the same thing. -[Two] Snatch?
Snatch. Stop saying that.
This mine.
[Seven] Yeah, nothing's simple.
The next building over, we use the sky cranes.
One as a sniper's nest for yours truly,
one as a crossover, building to building.
[man] Crane lose control. Very dangerous.
-Stay off the roof. -[Daqeeq] What do you mean?
-Because I will fuck you up. -You not fuck me up.
-What? -Don't talk to me like this!
-Smash you like a bitch. -No, no, no, no.
No? Bye.
[One] We have 15 minutes before HK police arrive.
-You afraid? -Nope.
-Good luck. -Saying good luck is bad luck.
-I take it back. -Taking it back is even worse luck.
-Go, go, go, go, go. -Yeah.
Good luck.
[Four] Do you want me to die?
Wanker.
[Five] It's time.
Ferrari's landed.
[Seven] It's a good ride, One.
A little scary up here, but...
[Four] Nah, this is fun. Don't be a pussy, Seven.
Yeah, I got the gun, smartass.
Remember that.
[Four] Slow it down, One. Slow it down.
[Seven] Overwatch is set.
I got the target in his bed, scratching his balls,
reading some Chinese book.
Hit it, guys.
[Seven] Eagle's landed.
I love that movie line.
Hello, boys.
-[man speaking Cantonese] -You know, laughter is life.
Just kidding. I stole that from my old dentist's office.
Along with a shit ton of nitrous.
[man] Hey!
Badges? We don't need no stinking badges.
[Two] One, laughing gas is working.
[Five] Oh, shit.
We got a 911.
-Cops were called. -Cops?
[Five] We got 13 minutes.
Zip line secure.
Ready, ready.
[Seven] One.
There's movement, man.
Where?
[Seven] Four bogeys. Rooftop.
-[laughter] -What, am I funny to you?
I'm funny?
How am I funny to you?
Do I amuse you?
I'm gonna need your finger. Come here.
[Two] Two and Three, in the elevator.
[One] All right. You got targets.
On your left, eye level.
[Seven] Underwater. Thirty seconds.
He's in some shit, man.
Freeze, Four.
He's above you.
Sixty seconds.
One, he's gonna drown. I got four guys up top. Want me to drop 'em?
No, mission will be compromised.
[Seven] Let me drop 'em, One. This is what I do.
He's been under 120.
He's gonna drown.
Four, move right.
Incoming round.
You're welcome.
And y'all can refer to me as Mr. Seven from now on.
[Three] Hot mask.
In a Darth Vader daughter kind of way.
Maybe later we can... coochie-coochie?
[Two] Stop it.
[Three] Woochie-woochie-coochie.
A little over-the-top, guys.
[Three] Oh, Check this out.
I went to the dentist.
[Two] Oh, my God.
-You lost one of the seals! -Huh?
[Two] You're on laughing gas, you dumb motherfucker.
-[laughs] -Give me your gun.
-[Three] I'm not giving you my gun. -You're a danger to yourself.
-[gun cocks] -[Three] I am the danger.
[One] No more movie lines.
Okay? Not just tonight... but ever.
[Three] It's a TV line, not a movie line.
[Two] Just stay behind me.
[Three] Yes, Miss Vader.
-You almost done there? -[Two] Okay, we've got a problem.
Three got hit with nitrous, and he's stupider than usual.
This is the funniest shit ever! [Three laughs]
-[One] How you doing over there? -[grunts]
You having fun yet?
Anyone ever asked you dumb questions when you're 90 stories up?
No need to climb angry.
Mate, you're really ruining my flow right now, you know that?
[Seven] Get those high-intensity speakers placed.
I got the targets all grouped in the kitchen.
Hey, have you ever... you ever been to an American movie theater?
Between 1983 and 2015?
No, I just pirate them on my phone.
That's an asshole move. All right.
Get ready to pull that trigger.
Till my finger hurts.
[in English] No party here! No party!
Hit it.
Now.
[Three laughs] I see dead people.
-[Two] Help me. -[laughing]
Three!
-Get off. -[laughing hysterically]
[Three] What are you doing?
[man] Move, move, move. Move, move, move, move, move.
-I got 'em up top. -[silenced gunshots]
[Seven] Move.
Who are you? Stay away. Stay away!
-Let's go. -[Seven] One, Four's got the target.
Always starts out well.
-[Four] Stay low. -[Murat] You're American military?
[Seven] Two, Three, you're clear to move up top.
Four, move.
Got the target. Moving out.
Let's go.
[Three] Oh, wow. Look at this.
-[Two] Stay behind me, idiot. -Oh, yeah.
-[man] Don't move! -[Seven] I got him.
[Four] Come on.
Move, move, move, move, move.
[Two] Get back here!
[Three] One sec.
-Oh, pearl handle. -Oh, shit.
[Three] That's a cool piece.
[Two] This is like bringing a child to a gunfight.
There you go. Come on, come on, come on. Say peek-a-boo, you punk.
[Two] No, no! Stop!
[Three] Ouch!
[Seven] Who the fuck was that?
Somebody speak to me.
-Please tell me I did not just kill Three. -[Three] What? These are good masks.
The hell you picking up a bad guy's gun for, man?
-[Three] You shot me, bro! -This is going great.
-You shot me! -[Seven] Because you're an idiot.
-You don't look through a bullet hole. -I'm so mad at everyone right now.
What's new? I like you mad.
Wrong intel. Too many men.
Oh, no. I'm pissed now.
I just got shot by my own man. More guys coming.
[Five] What's going on? You guys have one minute left.
We're only supposed to have seven guys working.
Where are they coming from?
[man] Go.
[Seven] We got five more targets.
Get up here now, all you've got.
Watch out for the snipers.
[Two] Two at the bar, three in the corner.
Okay, we do like that movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, okay?
They died at the end of that movie.
-They do? -Yeah.
Hey, Chan, what's up?
[Seven] Two, Three, hold at the stair.
[Five] Fifteen minutes.
-Half of China's in the lobby. -[One groans]
That's... That's high.
[Five] We're out of time. What the hell are you guys doing up there?
Come on.
We're stuck at the stairwell.
Can we go down?
Negative. This place is full of police. Do not come down.
[Murat] They're surrounding us.
[Three] Only one way out. That's up.
[Two] Two coming up.
Guys, I got a bad idea.
What do you mean you have a bad idea? No, you're supposed to have good ideas.
Like a... really, really bad idea.
One, remember when I said some shit was gonna go bad?
Shoot people!You're a sniper, goddamn it!
[Seven] It's fucked up right now, so watch me work. I'm improvising.
Y'all might wanna grab a hold of some shit.
-[Three] What do you mean? -[Two] The pool!
[Three] Oh, no, no, no! Back, back!
[Two] Grab something!
Jump!
[Three] Hang on!
You drowned everybody!
Drowned the whole fucking team!
-Dumbest idea ever. -[Two] Fucking crazy.
-Almost killed us. -[Murat] I don't like Seven.
-[Three] We need a long talk after this. -[Seven] We'll chat later.
-Hey.Whoa, whoa.Okay. -[rapidly approaching footsteps]
[Seven] You wanna tell everyone where you learned that shit?
-Go. -Is a helicopter coming to rescue us?
-[Three] Pretty soon. -'Cause...
[panicked] Oh, no. No, no, no. Come on, no. What? Wait.
Oh, my God. I'm afraid of heights. I will have a heart attack.
-Yeah? Don't cover your face! -[shouts] Ah!
-[Murat] Ow! -Why?
-I'm knocking him out. -[Murat] Stop.
-You're to save-- -[Three] Come on!
It's gonna be over soon!
-[Murat] Ow! -Hey, hey, hey!
-[Three] Go down! -[One] Stop!
-Goddamn it! -[Murat] What bullshit is this?
-Goddamn it! -[Murat] What bullshit is this? I thought you guys are here to rescue me.
-[One] He's the good guy. -Yes!
-What's wrong with you, you fucking goon? -[Murat yells]
-I was trying to knock him out. -No. He's the point of the mission.
-Use your head. -He wasn't going.
No, get out! Go!
-Go. -Whatever. I'm leaving.
Adiós, asshole.
No. No!
-No! No, no. Stay away. -[Three] Come here!
[Murat] Get off me.
-[Three] You fucking... -Hey!
[Three] Come on.
Oh, now what?
-Do you have rabies? -No.
You have rabies?
-What? -What?
-What the fuck is wrong with you? -He was escaping.
And why do you think he might wanna get away from you?
You should thank me. I just saved the mission.
What? Get off of him.
-Get off of him. -[Murat] Get off me.
-Get off of him. -[Murat] Get off me. How many times do I have to save this mission? Fuck.
-Probably have some ice in the car. -Fucking sick prick. I'm so sorry.
-[Murat] Your buddy is an asshole. -Hey.
Come on. It gets better.
Don't help.
Don't help. Just stay right there, James Bond. Thank you.
Three bullets.
Come on, Four. We're moving.
Just go.
I can't get across.
They cut the zip line.
I'm sorry.
It's just bad luck.
[softly] Yeah.
Bad luck.
-[approaching police sirens] -[Five] Come on, come on.
That's a lot of cops.
[man] Come on. Get up!
[Four] Whoa! I'm coming, I'm coming.
What made your president change his mind?
This wasn't him. The guy doesn't know how to spell Turgistan.
This better not be what I'm thinking it is.
-What's that? -A coup.
Exchanging my brother with me.
-What is that? -Three blew the budget on the Ferrari.
-Sorry. My bad. My bad. -Stupid.
It's adorable. We are not having a good night.
I can't steer like Six, so let's avoid any violent bullshit, all right?
Oh, shit!
Was that a bad guy?
-[police officers speaking in Cantonese] -Shit.
[Three] Kill him?
-[Policeman in Cantonese] -[One] No.
-[Three] Want me to kill him? -[One] No.
[Murat, in English] Hey!
-Cops. I've been kidnapped! -I'm gonna kill him.
-And I'm gonna let you. -They are kidnapping me!
-[speaks in Cantonese] -Hey, cops, where are you going?
Whoa. Shit.
Fuck.
-[suspenseful music playing] -Fuck. [Four] I made it across.
Southwest side.
Where are you guys?
No!
-Stop the car. -No, don't stop the car.
-We're leaving him. -What?
-[Seven] No. -He's on his own.
-[Seven] Stop the car. -Do not stop the car.
-Stop the fucking car! -Hey! Don't fucking do it!
He cocked it first.
I'm not doing this again. I'm not leaving him behind.
We're all we got.
-[Seven] Get out the car. -[Three] He's in the net up there.
Dude, little space.
Die!
[Three] Come on. Hurry, Seven.
Come on, come on, come on.
I'm gonna kill you.
[Four] No!
[One] Hurry, Seven.
Nice shot.
Carvers.
Cleavers.
They're making war on me.
My most loyal generals are dead, and my brother is loose.
They're not shadows. They're men.
[woman] And women.
Uncommonly skilled in covering their tracks.
Outside of their violence against you, they appear not to exist at all.
You mean to tell me in a world of cell phones and Internet browsers--
We have found no digital footprints.
She was declared dead seven months ago.
Your firm is helpless.
I find people by examining their links to the world,
to families, friends, employers, organizations.
Once I find a thread, I pull it and keep pulling it until I reach them
so I can have my teams kill them.
How is this different?
Whatever links to the world these people had, they've cut them.
And yet they walk the Earth like you and me.
They have blood types and birthdays and sock drawers.
This ghost act is itself a form of hubris.
If they exist, they can be made not to.
We're good.
This shit isn't sitting right with me, man. You made me a promise.
You said you'd always let me pull the trigger.
Yeah. Yeah, I did say that.
-Yeah, you remember that? -Okay, easy.
-You know why we don't use names? -Why?
No offense, Four, I'm glad you're alive,
but you left us out on that street there. We were totally exposed.
If I was up there, I'd expect you to leave me and not turn back.
-Fuck that. -Mission is more important than the man.
Fuck the mission.
-You don't leave a soldier behind. -I got news for you.
Seven, you're not a soldier anymore. She's not a doctor.
She's not a spy.
-He's not a hitman. And I'm not a CEO. -A rich asshole?
Oh, I am still a rich asshole.
-I just don't have a name. -You are. What's your name?
-Don't tell him. -I'm Blaine.
I just saved your life.
What's your name?
It's Billy.
Billy.
-You look like a Billy. -You look like a Four.
I'm Javier.
Camille.
Amelia.
It's nice to meet everyone. That's great.
That's great. Let's go, let's go.
Great.
[Seven] Hey, ghosts. This is Seven, AKA Blaine.
We're below radar, we're entering Turgistan airspace.
That gives us four days till Day of the Dead.
[woman] Concentric circles.
Your enemy's radius of operations is shrinking.
Thirty-eight hours ago,
an unidentified aircraft vanished off-radar near Tyrus.
It filed no flight plan, it ignored control and then disappeared.
Two, Three, you hustling? Speed it up.
[Two] Don't drop it.
It's a two-block walk. Come on.
Funny guy. What is your number?
One, Two, Three? Whatever it is. My number is Zero.
I'm doing jack ass here.
You got the biggest job of all 'cause none of this matters if you don't step up.
They will catch all of us!
Can I ask you something?
-[inspirational music playing] -If you had one shot,
one opportunity to seize everything that you ever wanted
in one moment, would you capture it or let it slip?
Was that, uh... Was that Eminem?
-Yes. -You gave me fucking goosebumps.
If I do whatever you're asking me to do, my brother will cut off my head.
And he loves cutting heads. And believe me,
compared to what he will do with you ghosts, this is nothing.
[Two] Arm them.Click to the right.
I wonder how many people you have to kill to get one of these.
We're at the TV relay.
Hey, are you afraid?
[Five] He's in.
Three little words have helped dictators rule:
State-run television.
We're gonna become the new heads of programming...
-[high-pitched tone] -Inverter's in place.
...and you're gonna be our new spokesperson.
After his national address, he'll have a big party on his yacht.
[One] If we're gonna flush Rovach to his yacht,
we need to disable security at his palace,
which means a crippling surge of electricity,
which means an unannounced visit to a state-run power generator.
This one's highly defended, no back doors, so we walk through the front.
All right, guys. You're clear to the gate.
[One] Never underestimate the power of a very nice suit.
Remember, they don't like Americans.
Everything's looking good. They're in.
Cheeks on seats.
[in Scottish accent] Manchester.
Manchester and Farquarson. We've got a website, look it up.
Inspection is our business. That's the slogan.
And your name again?
My name is Mr. Worthington, -and this is my associate, Mr. Ferijips-- -[in Turkmen accent] Ferjelpo.
-and this is my associate, Mr. Ferijips-- -[in Turkmen accent] Ferjelpo.
[uncertainly] Surjepo.
And he's from...
Turgistan.
-Turgistan. -Turgistan.
You want soup?
Got any booze in there?
No.
-Cup. Compliment his wife. -Is that your wife?
It's my daughter.
It's hard living out here, isn't it?
She come out full grown?
Faked me out there with the gray hair and the wrinkles
-and the orthopedic shoes and-- -What do you want?
An unannounced stress test.
Plants three through seven, they passed.
And I have no doubt that you will, too. All right.
The only failure was at plant two.
You know, that was very...
Plant two failed?
..minor. Yes, so, you know Mr. Noor?
-We're trying to keep his name out of it. -Yeah.
Noor is a fool.
Yeah.
-Noor is dead. Say he's dead. -No, he's dead.
He died.
Wrong guy. He's alive. Fuck!
[breathing anxiously] Just recover. Recover.
Yeah. He was found with a belt...
tied around his neck in an unfortunate masturbating accident.
Ferocious masturbating accident.
It was very sad.
One, shut the fuck up.
-What? -Come on. We've all choked ourselves
having a little choke, haven't we?
Come.
And this is our finest room.
It transmits all state-run television and power to the palace.
Very efficient.
Maybe Mr. Grace can mention it to Mr. Bashir.
I doubt it.
[Seven] Does it ever bother you, bro?
To mean nothing to anyone.
Like, one wrong word in there, and they go find themselves an Eight?
Nine?
Why do you think I chose you?
A man whose longest relationship's with a rifle.
[chuckles] You don't know my fucking life, bro.
You can't do the stuff that we do and have someone you love.
It doesn't... It doesn't work.
Everybody's got someone or something to lose, man.
Even you.
No, I... I'm gonna leave this world the same way that I came into it.
Alone, thank you.
You can drop the boo-hoo bullshit 'cause I see through it.
You were good in there.
-I know. -Yeah, that Turkmen was garbage.
-[both laugh] -Fuck you.
You've got a soul, man. You should let it out.
[man] Presidente, we go live in five minutes.
[One] When the shit goes down,
presidential protocol is they take him to his yacht.
They store him in a stateroom.
It's hardened like a bunker.
[Two] Wow!It's so big!
[in English] How you doing, Mama?
[in English] Three, set at palace.
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
I just threw it together.
The route to Rovach's boat will take about an hour.
We need every second.
You know, none of us will be remembered.
What's about to happen will.
Little things, they add up to big things.
Let's go change the world.
[Murat] Hey, One.
I'm freaking the fuck out.
My fellow countrymen, well--
No, I can't do this.
I can't go live.
My brothers and, uh, my sisters.
I'm here to teach.
It's time for a revolution.
For so many years, our people have suffered under my brother.
Free yourself, rise up.
Set us free.
It's time for a revolution.
Who picked this?
You're welcome.
-It's a good song. -This... No.
-It's perfect. -That is subjective.
-[chanting] -[Murat] Rise up and let's take our country back.
We'll see if this works.
♪ Flares are going up Flares are going up ♪
-No. I don't really care. -[man 1] Power's out.
Just tell me. Who the fuck is it?
State TV are compromised. It's showing everywhere.
[man 2] We are under attack.
-[man] Breakthrough... -BBC... -Breaking news... -A coup is underway...
-Breaking news... -A coup is underway...
[in English] Every man we've got, fully armed and tacked.
All right, guys, here they come.
I'm counting cars. It's like a fucking parade.
Murat, go.
[Rovach] Scramble all squadrons.
Bring in strike fighters to escort me.
Replace traditional ordnance with sarin VX.
Start on my word.
Why is it always me that has to do this kind of shit, man?
Hey, Chatty Cathy. Do you know what over and out means?
I'm a little afraid. What do you want me to say?
Conversation's over. Capisce?
There's a lot of bad guys, and I'm the only good guy here. Move!
If I die, just tell my mother that I love her.
Over and out!
They poke the nest, they're gonna find hornets.
Oh, okay, papi. They have fighter jets.
They have fighter jets, man.
Is this gonna work?
Well...
I hope so. [laughs]
We better hurry.
Where'd you get these?
It's the pro shit.
Ghost guns.
Ceramic barrels, plastic frames, plastic mags.
[Rovach] These are no longer my people.
Through that crowd. Through that crowd!
No, you evil fuck!
This is where you ask me if I'm afraid.
Right now, I'm shit scared.
Dropping one! Two!
Three! Four!
Drive. Drive fast.
What's the status, Three?
I'm good. Just making the world a better place, that's all.
Go! Go! Let's go!
[Seven] TOT, let's go, let's go, let's go!
Hey, Four, you've gotta sabotage that anchor.
See you on the other side.
Open the bridge.
All the way.
Don't start the party without me.
[One] Time clock. Guys.
Let's go. Go.
President. Ready to go underway.
[in Italian]
[in English] Hello.
Why are we not moving?
Cauliflower is very nice.
-I wanna move! -I told the captain to move.
-I wanna move! -I told the captain to move. -There's nothing more I can do. -I want to move right now!
-There's nothing more I can do. -I want to move right now!
He's German. He's very precise.
Start the engines. Prepare to leave.
[Two] Side door is opening.
Take the wheel! Take the wheel!
Lock the boat down.
Everyone, strap on body armor,
and tell the captain let's get going.
[captain] Captain of the Kismet.
I need military escort.
Not so fast. We're gonna stay and party. Get down.
Down. Get down. On your knees.
-All right. -Show me your hands, por favor.
Two hands!
[man, on radio] This is Turgistan security on the Kismet. Pirates have just--
[Four] Comms cut. We're good.
-Bonjour. -Hi. -Hey. -Hi.
Hey, papi.
Listen closely.
The enemy is us.
We must target him not where he is strong but where he's weak.
Hospitals, to take away his safety.
Schools, to take away his future.
Youth, to suffocate his hope.
[Murat] Stop.
-[Rovach] Commence gas attack. -Get out of my way.
[Rovach] Do it now.
Do it!
I said do--
Join me, brothers.
So you don't have to kill your own people again.
Tell the military to back away from that boat.
Together, we will bring peace to our beloved country.
We're good.
Guards have chest armor.
Yes, they do.
[Seven] We got the fancy composite Kevlar. I hope this works, man.
-[One] It'll work. -They have some fancy food up there.
Really? Tell me more about that. Don't hold back.
This fish soup they call... labu... labuan...
I'm fucking kidding. Focus.
It's so delicious, man. They put this little cheese on it.
Does it have to be on the walkie-talkie? And we're all standing right here. Yeah?
Don't you give me attitude, okay?
-Over and out. -[muttering] I...
Don't scratch my boat with your guns. It cost me one billion manat.
[One, in English] When I pop this, the magnet pulse lasts for 15 seconds.
Welcome to the world's biggest magnet.
I was thinking that when this is over, I want you to meet my mother, yes?
[laughs] Oh, God. You didn't say that.
What? Yes, I said it.
What's wrong with you people?
Ooh! Big guns.
I found the back doors to Rovach's suite.
Fuck!
[groans] Ah, fucking American-made!
The fucking chip fell out.
-What? -What?
-The chip fell out! -Well, fix it.
I can't just fix it, all right? The phone is very fucking complicated.
No. No, no, no, no. No, no. Go. Go, go, go.
-Sir, please, we must leave right now. -Hungry. I went for a dip.
-I'm important guest. -We have to--
I just went for a dip, all right?
This is succulent chicken, man.
-Show me your hands. -This couscous?
Show me your hands!
Fine.
Hey.
You know what?
I would love to meet your mother.
Really?
I'm really happy.
-[police siren wails] -[Seven] Contact!
Come on.
-[One] What the fuck? -[Seven] One!
-What the fuck? -Put the phone down, and use your gun.
I got it, I got it! I got it!
-Grenade! -[loud drone]
Gah!
Holy shit! I mean, I wasn't sure it would work.
I mean, I wasn't "sure" sure. I had a suspicion, but I, uh...
God, this is all so fucking dangerous.
Move!
Hey, hey!
You like that phone now, motherfucker?
This thing is amazing.
Stop fucking around. We gotta find Rovach.
Oh, shit. What happened?
What the fuck?
[in English] Jesus. What did you do?
You goddamn animals.
Don't look at me. She's the evil one.
-You did this? -Yeah.
-Why? -[Seven] If we don't move quick,
-they're gonna pull them from the boat. -You're sick.
Disgusting.
[One] Let's find Rovach.
[Seven] Let's go.
More guys coming.
[Seven] Flashbang!
[man] Move it here!
[man] Move, move.
-The boat's moving. -That's bad.
-Mag! -[automatic gunfire]
-Magnet! Where is the magnet? -[Seven] They're getting their guns!
-Fix the phone! -I'm trying!
The screen is cracked!
We get it! They're dead!
Shit. They got our position. We need to move.
Honestly, I didn't think we'd make it this far.
Go kill the engine.
[One] That is disgusting!
It was a flashbang.
Holy shit.
We should split up.
Go with him.
Get me to the boat.
-You. Where's Rovach? -[clattering]
I feel like a Jedi.
Five, flush him out.
[Four] Five, find Rovach. I'll distract the guards.
I wouldn't do that.
[man] We're sinking.
I've got four guys on me. I'm on the upper deck, and I'm screwed.
[One] No, no, no!
Come on!
Oh, no.Wait. Wait. I got it.
Big motherfucker.
-[both exclaim] -I almost shot you right in the head.
Goddamn it. You go eat some food.
-Fuck you. -Fuck you.
No, you fuck you.
-[Two] I'm in Rovach's stateroom. -[Rovach speaking Turkmen]
-[in English] Get me to the rescue boat. -One.
Rovach is leaving with a guard.
What do you want me to do?
Four, where you at?
[Four] One, please!
-Four? -[Four] Help me!
Give me a hint, buddy.
Get me out of this boat.
What's your 20? Anybody got eyes on the target?
I don't know my 20. Stay off the channel. I'm going for Four.
-Four, where you at, buddy? -[Seven] You're breaking your own rules.
I thought you didn't have a family.
Presidente!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
It's a big ship. Say something, pal.
He's gonna kill me.
Look, Bond, you gotta get here fast.
There you are.
Cleavers.
What?
It's a TV show. Come on, let's go.
Fucking millennials.
Ship's sinking. Come on.
They're all in. ♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪
As fast as she can fly to the villa in Dezar.
They sunk my boat.
I was thinking of somewhere else.
-Hey. -I'll blow your fucking head off!
Who are you?
[One] No one.
Murat!
[reporter1] In Turgistan, we're witnessing a regime change.
[reporter 2] We're following a major breaking story. [reporter 3] Country's overthrown...
[reporter 4] Countries around the world are now mobilizing to give them help.
Refugee camps are emptying. It's an amazing sight to see.
[reporter 5] We're following a major breaking story.
[reporter 4] We understand now that they're dropping Rovach off to rebels.
[Rovach] I know you.
From the opera, right?
-Welcome to Act Five. -I knew it.
What are you gonna do?
Murat!
I'm your brother!
You didn't listen to me, Brother.
Kill me here, huh?
I wanna die with dignity.
Kill me here.
Kill me here!
Kill me!
Kill me right now.
Don't let them touch me.
Shoot me right now!
Murat!
No! No!
[One] Truth?
I have no idea what happens when you die.
Death's still a mystery.
But life...
a little less so.
Alone...
we walk the Earth...
quiet.
But together?
As a team?
Oh, we can do some shit...
awfully loud.
They say that your soul departs when you pass.
Well, for us, it was the opposite.
The moment nothing to lose...
became something to gain.
And the whole wide world...
seemed a little less haunted.
And so, I'm sitting there staring at him, right?
He tells me to get my crunchy fucking fucknuts the fuck out of there.
You believe that shit?
-You know what I said, right? -No, what did you say?
-Shit. "Okay." -You fucking said, "Okay."
I'm sure you did.
Control Center, this is Stillwell 1215.
Go ahead, Stillwell 1215.
I'm about four cars out of 57th Street station...
...being delayed by a red signal light.
Should be green, Stillwell 1215.
Yeah, tell me something I don't already know.
All right, roll through it slow, extreme caution, per the rulebook.
Yeah, cracked rail. Nine-hundred feet from the east end of the platform.
It's the goddamn cold. Metal contracts, you know that.
I got it, I got it. How long it take to fix it?
Gotta put a plate on it. Two hours.
Thank you. Make it an hour and a half, I'll buy you a beer.
Shit, G.B. I hate to see you down here on the floor, man.
Temporary, baby. I'll be up there behind the glass before you know it.
I'm gonna need the R train...
...to switch over to the express tracks at 34th.
-Which express tracks? -The one that Q uses.
Once they exit the 57th Street, they can switch over to the F Line.
Straight into Queens.
Once they get to Queens, they switch back at 36th Street to the R Line.
All you gotta do, suspend the W, N and R will pick up the slack.
I can't see where I gotta look.
Unlock the door. Do it now or I'll kill you. Do it.
All right, all right.
Shut up and walk.
First car, go.
See? I told you I could do this.
Big fucking deal, you did what you said you'd do.
All right.
Five minutes of peace.
-Yeah! -Nice!
-Nice. -All right.
There you go.
I'm on the train and I still got you.
-You still got me? -I got you. What are you doing?
You still got me?
Oh, my God.
Baby? Baby?
Give me the cutting key.
Cutting key.
Control Center calling Pelham 123. Come in, Pelham 123.
Why did you stop? You're all green ahead.
Control Center calling Pelham 123.
Control Center calling Pelham 123.
Why did you stop, 123? You got green ahead.
It's okay.
Life is simple now.
You just gotta do what I say.
Not now, okay?
Where are you from?
-Brooklyn. -You Irish?
Yeah.
I thought so.
Who's driving Pelham 123?
Maybe something fell on the tracks.
Wait. Are we going backwards?
42nd Street tower, I got a train wrong-railing...
...on the southbound Lexington Avenue Line just north of you.
Listen up, we need to stop and stay in-station.
All southbound locals just north of the 51st Street station.
The operator on 123 is Jerry Pollard.
I know Jerry Pollard. I went to motorman school with Jerry.
Pelham 123, come in to me, Pelham 123.
Pelham 123, Jerry Pollard, what's going on down there?
This is Control Center. What's going on, 123?
Get an express train to go alongside them, see what we see in the cab.
Yeah, this is South Ferry 105. I can't get my windshield wiper to turn on.
South Ferry 105, there's a circuit breaker right behind you for that.
What's going on?
Maestro, what's going on?
-Cop. -Excuse me.
-Fuck. -Watch your backs. Watch your backs.
When I say stop, stop it hard.
-Transit Police. -Stop.
Everybody sit the fuck down!
Down!
Sit the fuck down!
Jesus! We're getting reports of gunshots down the tunnel.
Sergeant Moran.
-Delgado, let's call off that express. -Got it.
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna fucking die, man.
Come on! Hey.
Everybody up! By the window! Come on, up, up, up!
Stand up! Stand up! Come on!
Move it! Against the window!
What the fuck is going on?
There was a cop. Bashkin shot him.
I think-- I think he's dead.
Put Bashkin on and find your fucking guts!
-Do it! -Fuck.
-What happened? -A cop. He's dead.
Put the conductor on.
-What's your name, conductor? -Regina.
Regina, baby, listen, you got a job to do, honey.
A job?
God put you on this Earth for one thing and one thing only.
You conduct those people off the train...
...up to the platform. You got that? Let me hear it.
Let me hear you do that.
Listen up, everybody.
We're gonna go back to the platform. I need everybody to--
Regina. Let's do it again.
Conduct those people.
Listen. Now, we're gonna head back towards the platform.
I want everybody to slowly get up.
-I'm gonna get you off this train. -Good.
Now, we're gonna be on the tracks, so if you don't need it, leave it.
Have been put on alert regarding--
Right here, right here. Right here, right here.
Cross right here, right here.
-Go. -Cross over right here, right here.
Let's go.
-Up the stairs, up the stairs. -Here you go.
-Every cop in the city is on the way. -Maybe it wasn't gunshots.
Train could be blowing breakers. Or the motor blew?
No, this is on purpose.
Fuck you.
-Yeah, I'm coming. -Get the fuck off the walls.
Shut the fuck up and come on.
Shit. Come on.
Ramos. Turn the power off from there down.
What?
Turn the power off from there down!
Okay, I got it!
My fucking lucky day.
Shit. What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
Pelham 123 to Rail Control Center. Do you read me?
Yes, I read you, Pelham 123.
This is Control Center. Who is this?
It's me, man. I didn't wanna call till everything was ready.
-It's not Jerry. -I don't know who it is.
I understand, I understand, Pelham 123.
Who the hell is this?
This is the man who's gonna rock this city.
This is the man who's gonna give the city a run for the money.
Look up. Look up at your screen and you tell me what you see.
You see what I've done?
I see it.
One car is much more manageable than 10 with the manpower I got.
Motorman's gonna tell you about it. Tell him what we got.
They got hostages, lots of them.
-And they got machine guns. -That's Jerry.
-That's Jerry. -Yeah, that's right.
Check me, do you understand that?
I check, I understand.
Didn't I tell you to knock first?
Good, because this is what we call a cash transaction.
Now, you understand commodities, don't you?
You know, pork bellies? Gold? Light crude?
Listen, no disrespect, but maybe I'm not the guy you should be talking to.
Oh, no, you are exactly the guy I wanna talk to.
Now, I want you to look at the ticker and you tell me...
...what is the going rate for a New York City hostage today?
You think a million dollars is too much? I do. I think it's corny.
Now get your calculator out. You got one?
-Do you have a calculator? -Yeah, we got one. I got one.
Okay, good. Add this up. You got $526,315 and 79 cents.
That's 526,315.79.
Now, times that by 19.
What do you got?
What is he, a goddamn accountant?
-That's 10 million? -What do you got?
That comes out to 10 million plus one cent.
That is a deal.
You call the mayor and you tell him the price.
And then you tell him I want it in 100,000 $100 bills, you got that?
I got it. What about the one cent?
Keep that, that's your broker fee.
Now, I want the rest in plain suitcases...
...the kind with the wheels and the portable handle, okay?
Now, this is not a futures contract. This is a spot trade.
That means there's a time limit on it. Okay, you got that?
Now, what do you think is a fair time limit?
You know, I don't know. I'm really just a guy--
Come on, give me a time limit. Give me a fair time limit.
-Thursday. -I was thinking more like an hour.
Now, what's your watch say?
Two-thirteen.
Oh, that's exactly what my watch says.
So at 3:13, I want that money here, motherfucker.
And after that, there is a late fee.
What do you think that late fee is gonna be?
Come on, tell me what it'll be.
You're gonna kill the passengers?
Oh, commodities is what I start to kill.
One for every minute past the deadline I am forced to wait.
They become more valuable this way...
...and still at the same price.
He's underground. He's never gonna pull this off.
-Don't tell me, tell him. -Who the hell is this guy?
-I don't know who it is! -Garber, just stay with it.
What's your name?
-What's your name, my man? -My name?
What's your name?
Tell him?
-Garber. -Garber, okay.
Now, seriously, man, in 59 minutes...
...I'm gonna start killing passengers.
So my advice to you is to get on the phone, get the mayor notified now.
Listen, I mean....
I'm just a civil-service employee. I can't get ahold of the mayor.
That's your problem, not mine.
It's like, who's responsible for who lives and who dies in New York?
That's New York City's problem.
Get the fuck off the radio and notify the mayor, motherfucker!
Okay.
Nine months of this and I'm free. Next mayor gets inaugurated...
...I'm gonna be in Saint-Tropez on the beach with a piña colada.
I will never have to ride the subway ever again.
-Never say never, sir. -Never.
All right, what's next for the afternoon?
East Harlem Elementary at 2:30.
You're to read The Cat In The Hat to the third grade.
Every time I go to the schools, I get sick. They all have runny noses.
Call Dr. Katz, tell him I want him waiting at the school, with a flu shot.
Mayor's office.
-He's in Car 3. -Yeah.
What happened?
Somebody just hijacked a 6 train.
It's stopped in the tunnel between 51st and 42nd.
Another idiot with a gun. What do we know?
It's unclear, but I have a car waiting for us downstairs.
Subway will get us there faster.
All right. Let the doors close.
Tell them we'll meet them at 59th Street.
Tell the conductor this is now an express.
-We're skipping the next five stops. -What?
-I gotta get to work. -Hold on, hold on.
Everybody will get where they need to go, we'll make all the stops.
Maybe he's not such a douche bag after all, huh?
Funny.
Figures you'd be the one to get a call like this.
Hostage negotiation team here in five minutes and the mayor's been notified.
-You gonna tell him? -Get the fuck out of here.
My shift's over in 10 minutes.
-What are you staring at? -Your face.
I'm trying to remember for when it's not here.
-You gonna start in on me? -Right, I'm gonna start in on you.
-Don't fuck this up, Garber. -You wanna do it?
It's your station, your call.
-Oh, it's my call now? -That's right. Your call.
Come on.
Pelham 123, come in, this is Rail Control Center. Are you there?
Gerber Baby boy. What's up?
Garber. Just wanted to let you know the mayor's been notified.
Are they gonna pay?
I don't know. I'm just the, what'd you call me? The broker.
No, no, you represent the city of New York right now, buddy.
I can tell you you're dealing with one of the all-time bureaucracies, I know.
-I mean, it takes time. -You'd better fix the bureaucracy...
...because when the time comes, these hostages...
...are gonna go real quick.
You got it, you got it. Any other demands?
Yeah, no fucking pizza for them, either.
No, I mean, are you guys, like, you know, are you terrorists?
Do I sound like a terrorist? Do I terrorize you?
Actually, you don't, but I mean, not that I ever talked to one.
So--
So, what, this is just about money?
Oh, is there anything else?
There's not dying.
Yeah, well, you live, you die. You go with the current or you fight it...
...you all end up in the same place.
-Where's that, Jersey? -Yeah, you watch it. I was born there.
I'm just saying, you're up in the motorman's cab.
That means you're on the radio, which means that you're an easy target.
You gotta know the drill.
I know that soon I won't be alone...
...and if I'm the first to get shot, I'm the first of many to get shot.
That's correct, but then you'd still be dead.
Dead is an improvement on a lot of things I can think of, buddy boy.
Sounds like he slept with my ex.
You know, we all owe God a death.
And I'm a man who pays his debts. Are you a man who pays his debts?
Yeah, yeah, sure. TV, cable, and my mortgage.
-That's a little like dying once a month. -You're married, you're a married man.
Maybe.
No, no, no. You're married, man. Married men have mortgages.
You got a mortgage?
I don't know. Why don't you tell me, then we'll both know?
I don't know. I'm sure someone out there loves you dearly and...
...you know, would be worried about you.
You're in the motorman's cab...
...you got no cover, sniper on the way.
Well, you know, circumstances are my protection...
...because right now, you know, hostages are good insurance.
By the way I see it, I'm pretty well-protected.
You know, this reminds me of being in a confessional.
Are you Catholic?
I'm married, you're Catholic.
-Maybe. I don't know. -No, you're Catholic.
And a good Catholic...
...would know he's got a trainload of innocent people.
You don't wanna kill innocent people, do you?
A good Catholic knows that nobody is innocent.
And I'm not gonna kill all these hostages. I'd give up my leverage.
Well, I hope you know what you're doing.
It's running like a fucking Swiss watch down here, so don't worry about it.
So, what do I call you anyway?
Call me Ryder.
As in "train rider"?
Call me Ryder, with a Y.
Ryder.
I like you, Garber.
I do like you, man.
You may be the last friend I ever make.
Well, I hope you're wrong, Mr. Ryder. But, you know, I'm just a guy.
I'm just a guy on the other end of the mic.
Oh, you don't think this was meant to be?
You don't think this was fate, you and me?
I don't know. Things happen that lead to other things.
And maybe this was one of them, but that's it.
I never get excited about coincidence.
Well, you got 50 fucking minutes, so check me.
All right. 50 minutes, check.
And don't call me unless you got news.
-You got it. -Motherfucker.
G.B.
You're fucking good, man.
Okay. Move it the other way.
All right, come on, move it. The other way.
Okay, now move it back a little less.
Bingo. Got it.
All right, we got it.
-Who's talked to these jokers? -That would be me.
Yeah, under my supervision. Who are you?
Vincent Camonetti, N.Y.P.D. Hostage Negotiation Team.
John Johnson, Chief Transportation Officer.
Walter Garber. I'm Console Dispatch, right now.
What can you tell me, Walter?
His name is Ryder, with a Y.
And he's asking for $10 million by 3:13.
Looking toward the future. Say what he'd do if he doesn't get the money?
He said he'd kill a passenger every minute we go over.
-Starting at 3:13 p.m.? -3-1-3, yes, sir.
-Anything else? -He's smart.
If he's smart, why is he doing something so fucking stupid?
-On the train radio? -We can get him right here.
Any chance that we can get a signal down there?
We'd like to get him on one of our cells.
No, there's no chance, not where he is.
What's this? "Leverage, spot trade"?
Yeah, it's weird. He's like a money guy, like a Wall Street.
He talked about the passengers like they were commodities.
-"Catholic"? -Yeah, I think he's Catholic.
For chrissakes, Garber, you gonna tell us what his zodiac sign is now?
I'm just saying I think he's Catholic.
Man asked me about "Catholic." I wrote it down. I'm giving my opinion.
Unlike other people, I have an opinion.
Fellas, can we settle this dispute later?
-Absolutely. -Why do you think he's Catholic?
I think he's Catholic because he talked about original sin and confessions.
I wrote it down. I didn't know what else to do.
-Did he ask for a priest? -No.
Good. Anything else?
He sounded, the way he was talking, he sounded like he's not afraid to die.
Yeah, well, it's early yet.
-The calls are coming through...? -Right here.
You hit the blue button, you can reach him.
-He'll come back to you. -Mind if I take your seat?
-No, no, go right ahead. -Thank you, Walter.
You're welcome.
This is the six wire. You don't have to touch that one.
-Okay. -That goes around the room.
-Six wire. -Why don't you--
Just hit the talk here and then that mutes it.
Take the rest of the day off. Get out of here.
I thought I'd stick around, just make sure that....
Well, that wasn't a suggestion. So why don't you go home?
All right.
This is it. You got all the information over here about the 313.
-Wait for his call. -You want me to work it up right now?
You call headquarters, let them know that I'm here and I'm on the job. Okay.
I gotta take a piss.
So who's stopping you?
All right. We wouldn't wanna end up on any Amnesty International lists...
...so step up to the door, face out.
Open the middle door.
Do what you gotta do.
Can I jump down there?
-You gotta go or don't you? -I do, I gotta go.
Step up, my man. Let's go, let's go.
That kid's going places. All right, close the doors.
Pelham 123, come in.
-Pelham 123, please come in. -All right, everybody, sit down!
Who is this?
This is Lieutenant Camonetti. I'm with the N.Y.P.D. Hostage Negotiation Team.
I'd like to talk to you about the situation that we're in.
Where the fuck is Garber?
Mr. Garber is a train dispatcher.
-This is now a police matter. -Yeah, well, I wanna talk to Garber.
I'm sorry, Mr. Ryder, but Mr. Garber is no longer involved.
Motorman, up!
-Put Garber on. -To be honest...
...Mr. Garber has gone home.
Put Garber on the fucking line or I kill the motorman.
I guarantee you I am the best person for you to be talking to right now.
Give me a moment and I'll explain why.
You were always gonna be the first one to go.
Oh, Jesus!
Jesus.
Mr. Camonetti...
...you got 60 fucking seconds before I kill another.
-Okay? Fifty-nine, 58, 57.... -Get him. Just get Garber.
-Fifty-six, 55, 54.... -We're trying to locate Garber...
...ASAP, Mr. Ryder. Why did you do that?
Mr. Camonetti or whatever fucking greaseball name you got...
...the city of fucking New York killed Jerry, okay?
Fifty-three, 52, 51....
Garber. Garber!
Garber, he killed Jerry Pollard, man.
Come on, he wants to talk to you right now.
He's here. He's on the way.
Eleven, 10, nine, eight, seven....
-He's approaching the desk. -Six, five, four, three, two, one....
Hey, it's me, it's Garber.
Garber! You didn't say goodbye.
You killed Jerry?
No, the city of fucking New York killed Jerry, okay?
The biggest rat hole in the world fucking killed Jerry.
Okay? Now you can chalk another victim up to NYC.
-Now, can everybody hear me? -Yeah, we hear you, loud and clear.
Now you don't have to tell the cops...
...they don't tell me how to do it or how it's gonna be. I fucking tell them.
Don't you ever, ever leave me again.
Or I'll just have to hunt you down and I'll kill you.
Now, you got 39--
Thirty-nine minutes. Check me.
Thirty-nine, check.
This is Staley to ESU 2. What's your position?
ESU 2 approaching hostage car from south tunnel.
Go, go, go.
Ten-million dollars. I'll write him a check and get it over with.
-He wants it in cash. -I was joking, LaSalle.
But we've been given one hour to get the money together.
Ten-million dollars. Where do they get these numbers?
Actually, 10 is the limit, sir.
Why is that?
Request to the City Controller, he forwards it to one of our lenders...
...cash gets released to the Federal Reserve. Limit at any time is 10 million.
Some idiot with a gun wouldn't know that. I didn't know.
-Well, you're very busy, sir. -How do you know that?
Here he is.
-Henry, what's the situation? -They killed a hostage.
These guys may be the real deal.
I thought there was one idiot with a gun.
Multiple gunmen. They're not sure. They've got 18 hostages.
They'll kill more in an hour. That's the limit. They want you to know.
-What do we know? -Not amateurs.
They cut out a car, stopped on a rise.
They can see us coming 100 yards either way.
How long to get the money?
-I don't know. -Find out.
-You're not thinking of paying, are you? -I'm thinking of time and being ready.
Call the Controller. Tell them we'll pay.
What's with you and Garber, huh? Tell me about him.
Scheduled to work today?
-Yeah, absolutely. But.... -But what?
He's only had this particular job for a couple weeks now.
-Well, why is that? -Well, he's under investigation.
What?
-We were gonna suspend him-- -What's he being investigated for?
He went to Japan. He had to take a look at some new trains...
...and the allegation is that he took a bribe.
Took a bribe? Does he have a record?
-Not that I know. -You sure?
Yeah, yeah. I don't think so. I gotta take this.
The identity of the hijackers is still unclear.
The Hostage Negotiation Team has just arrived at MTA headquarters...
...to determine if this is a terrorist enterprise.
Is that what we are? An enterprise?
We're an enterprise.
Well, pilot reports that the aircraft has begun its descent.
This is Staley to ESU 4. What's your ETA?
Approximately two minutes south of target.
Why is the train called Pelham 123?
Comes out of Pelham Bay at 1:23 in the afternoon.
How did you end up with this call?
It's a Lexington Avenue train.
I got the Lexington Avenue desk. Came through my desk.
Can you think of a reason why you'd be targeted?
Someone wanna hurt you? Something against you or something?
No.
You recognize his voice?
No. No, as I said, it was a coincidence it came through my desk.
Did you pick this desk? Or was it assigned to you?
Did I...?
I said, did you pick this desk or was it assigned to you?
Can I take my coat off?
Doesn't make any sense.
-What doesn't? -Guy you're talking to.
He ain't a train dispatcher. Walter Garber.
-He's a big shot. -Big shot at what?
Rail Control. I mean, he runs things up there.
-At least he did before I went up. -His name is Walter?
Yeah.
Dude like that shouldn't be answering the phone.
-Mr. Ryder wants to talk to you. -Right.
Are you sure you don't have some sort of relationship with him?
I assure you, whatever relationship I have with him is better than yours.
Jerry, my friend, was killed while you were talking to Ryder.
Maybe that's a question you ask yourself instead of me.
I didn't have anything to do with this.
But what I have in you, Mr. Garber, is an unknown variable.
-Unknown variable? -Right. People's lives are at stake.
-I understand that. -Excuse me...
...if I try to get more comfortable with you, okay?
It ain't working, but okay.
Now, with that in mind...
...would you agree to a consensual search of your house?
Take me 40, 45 minutes to get a warrant.
What....
Yes, okay.
Got him.
Walter Garber, right there.
No shit, look at this.
-Guy took a bribe, man. -Yeah.
Baby!
ESU 2, this is Staley. What's your overall status?
All positions secured.
All right, hold your fire until instructed.
Pelham 123, can you hear me?
Yeah, loud and clear, back at you.
All right, the mayor has agreed to pay...
...and they're getting the money together right now.
Good.
Well, you know, you got 28 minutes, so I advise him to make haste.
-I'm sure he will. -So is your first name Walter?
-Excuse me? -Your name, is it Walter?
-Yes, it is. -Good.
What are you doing dispatching trains?
I thought you were some sort of MTA big shot.
I work for the MTA. Today they put me at dispatch...
...and my bad luck.
I thought you didn't believe in bad luck.
I said I didn't believe in fate.
Do you believe in rigged contracts for new trains?
Look, what are we talking about this for?
-I need to know who I'm dealing with. -You need to know who--?
Yeah, I want to know who I'm dealing with. I mean, are you a bad penny?
Let me explain something to you.
Being accused of something is one thing.
Being guilty of it is something entirely different.
Well, agreed. But you gotta take me through this, my man.
You got to tell me from the top. This whole train thing. Come on.
All right, I started out in maintenance.
Platform maintenance, track maintenance, flagman...
-...conductor. -Conductor, really?
Yeah. And then motorman.
A motorman. How long did you do that for?
I drove them over six years.
I went to tower operations, assistant dispatcher, dispatcher.
I finally ended up--
Yeah, you're assistant chief transportation officer or something.
-Right? -That's right.
And part of my job is to go out to the manufacturers, you know...
...the people who build the trains and bid on contracts for the trains.
Is that where you took the bribe?
The Japanese train over the Canadian train?
I did not take a bribe, all right? I was accused of taking a bribe.
I have not been proven guilty yet.
They haven't said yet. I mean, they haven't decided.
Well, they got no proof. I don't care what they decide. It doesn't matter--
Then is this when they demoted you?
That's correct. They demoted me, pending the outcome.
And now they're trying to humiliate you, is that right?
Motherfuckers.
Look, I know how these things work, man, okay?
Everything doesn't seem to appear like what it is.
But you've gotta be completely honest with me, man.
-Don't know what you're talking about. -How did you do it?
I didn't. I'm innocent.
Oh, you're innocent.
No, you're talking to a Catholic, man.
We've been over innocent before. Okay?
Look, I've been through all this, man. So just tell me, how did you do it?
I didn't do it.
Okay, that's it! That's fucking it!
Damn it.
-Kid. You. -Me?
No, no, you. Up. Get the fuck over there.
I don't know what you did to piss him off.
Garber. You know what I'm looking at?
-Do you know what I'm looking at? -No, I do not.
First there's my gun, and at the end of my gun-- What's your name?
-George. Everyone calls me Geo. -George. His friends call him Geo.
Got this '80s skateboard thing going.
He makes it work, but it's not gonna look too good in his casket.
Listen, Ryder, just slow down. We haven't reached the deadline.
No, there's no fucking deadline, man.
You just gotta tell me the truth.
-About what? -The bribe!
-Did you take it? -I didn't take a bribe.
Okay, you got five seconds to save this kid's life.
I didn't do anything.
-Five.... -Just wait a second.
-Four, three.... -Wait a second!
Two....
-Fucking tell him how you did it. -All right, okay.
-Say it. -I took the bribe.
How much?
Thirty....
How fucking much?
Thirty-five thousand dollars.
How did you do it?
I went to Japan to look at these trains.
It's part of my job.
I....
I don't get to vote, okay? I just recommend.
I chose what I thought was the best train...
...the Japanese had the best train, and I made my recommendation.
That's before you took the bribe.
Yes.
That was the train you were gonna pick anyway, huh?
-Yes. -And now you're fighting for your job...
...and they're trying to humiliate you?
No, no, no. I did what I did.
And....
And it's not, you know, it's not the MTA's fault.
What did you spend it on?
Look, what does this got to do with anything, huh?
What did you fucking spend it on?
I used the money for my kids, all right?
To pay my children's tuition.
I have a 17-year-old. I have a 19-year-old daughter.
And I used the money to pay for their college tuition, all right?
You know what, Garber?
You're my goddamn hero, you know that?
You got a kid here, you don't even know him, you saved his life.
That's brave, man. That's fucking heroic.
-Tell Garber thank you. -Thank you, Garber.
"Thank you, Garber, for saving my life."
Thank you, Garber, for saving my life.
You're welcome.
Sit down.
You're just like me, Garber. I fueled this city.
I fed it breakfast every morning, and now we're the bad guys.
I don't think so. I don't fucking think so!
-Hello, Therese. -Honey, look.
There are police here, Walt. They wanna search the house.
They said you said it was okay.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay. It's-- Just let them in.
We got nothing to hide.
Is this about the investigation?
No, no. You watching TV?
This hostage thing. Yeah, yeah, I'm watching it.
Well, it's just that....
I'll tell you about it when I get home...
...but I'm in the middle of it now and they wanna do background checks...
...on everybody involved here from the MTA.
-That's why they're at the house. -All right, okay. But you're okay?
I'm fine, I'm fine. Just let them in. I'll see you when I get home.
All right. Okay, bye.
I'm sorry, Walter.
I am.
Listen, don't let this guy bring you into his reality, all right?
That's what he wants to do. He hurts you, you get angry.
-He's got the advantage. Understand? -Yeah.
Just deflect, if you can.
-Okay? All right. -All right.
I hope they don't get fucking lost.
Fuck me! Ten-million bucks.
The joke is, say we dipped in, took some?
Bad guys would count it, come up short, probably kill us.
No shit.
Geo, what the fuck's happening?
Geo. Geo, what's going on?
Geo.
I'm a fucking hostage.
Listen to me. Stream it on our site. Call the news.
Shit.
Hey.
We've gotta do something. They're gonna kill us.
You got a plan?
I thought you'd have one.
Because I'm some tough-looking black guy?
I saw that ring on your finger.
That was a long time ago.
-Okay? -My husband had one just like it.
A severe sell-off underway...
...the Dow is down 450 points in very heavy trading...
...as Wall Street reacts to the terrorist attack...
...of the New York City subway system.
-How's my hair look? -Fine. You ready to make a statement?
When I have something to tell them.
It's a leadership moment, sir.
I'm not running for re-election, for fucking president.
I left my Rudy Giuliani suit at home.
You're being selfish. It'll take 30 seconds to reassure them.
-Over there! -Mr. Mayor!
-Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor! -Will you be making a statement?
We're doing everything the situation demands.
I'm not gonna speculate right now. All right?
-Mayor, is it terrorism? -No.
Hey.
Mayor! Are they terrorists?
All right, all right, all right!
Listen, nobody said anything about terrorism...
...or a bomb, anything like that. Let's stop that right now, all right?
How about your divorce? Care to speculate how that's going?
Your divorce, sir.
Been a lot of talk in the news lately...
...that you have extramarital problems. Your divorce, sir!
Put it on channel 15.
We got a girl in Brooklyn watching it on her boyfriend's computer.
-It's on the damn Internet. -What?
Hold on.
-Son of a bitch. -That's Ramos, isn't it?
That's Phil Ramos.
-Yes, it is. -Who's Phil Ramos?
He was a motorman. He killed a couple of passengers 10 years ago?
High on cough syrup, ran into the platform, went to jail for manslaughter.
Phil Ramos, I want everything.
Prison time, known associates, the works. Looks like it's from the floor.
-Should the Internet be working there? -No. No way.
Maybe that's how he knows about you. He Googled you.
Or maybe Ramos told him, who knows?
Goddamn, it's the mayor. Hello, Your Honor.
Do me a favor, forget about those guys.
Easy for you to say.
You rather be one of those hostages?
No.
Listen up, I'll give you a crash course on hostage negotiating.
We're like rodeo clowns.
We keep the bull from focusing on what he'd like to do. Which is what?
-Kill a cowboy. -Exactly.
Now, he's got his deadline. You slow things down.
Preservation of life. That's our mission. Guy's already proven he's serious.
Next deadline's gonna give a chance again.
-How do we deal with that? -Get the money there on time.
If we don't, we pretend the deadline doesn't exist...
...talk through it, we buy time, get movement.
-Movement? -That's right.
Contradicts himself, inconsistency in his demand, you got some movement.
-Right. -All right, let's go out there.
This was the scene moments ago...
...outside the Rail Control Center in Midtown.
I'm not gonna speculate right now.
That is a beautiful suit he's got there.
Can't get it out of my head. I'm gonna die today.
Visualization's a very powerful thing. You keep thinking it, you never know.
Please let it be me who drops this motherfucker.
Hey, Garber. You there, buddy?
Yeah, I'm here.
A little birdie told me the mayor walked in.
Can I talk to him?
-Can he hear me? -How does he know I'm here?
-Does he have a camera in here? -Can he hear me?
We can, we can, we can-- We can all hear you here. Yes.
Okay, good. So tell him-- Tell him I wanna make him a deal.
Tell him I'll make him a deal right now.
Okay, all right.
Well, come on, speak up, Mr. Mayor.
You're talking to your constituents.
We got a train full of registered voters. Don't you care?
Don't you care about your voters?
This is not a good idea. Don't talk. Don't engage with him.
I know what I'm doing, I've been doing this a long time.
Come on, buddy, speak up.
You gotta hit the blue button there, Your Honor.
Yes, this is the mayor.
Hey. Good to meet you, man.
And listen, tell me this, is this true?
I read that you make, like...
...one dollar a year to be a mayor of New York, is that true?
Yes, but at least it's honest work.
After taxes that's, like, 87 cents, isn't it?
Yes.
Don't bullshit me, man.
It would take, like, 3000 years to pay off that suit that you're wearing.
What do you got, 20, 30 million dollars or something like that?
You don't get that without screwing someone, screwing everyone.
I'm sure your wife knows something about that.
You said you had a deal for me.
Yeah, I do. I wanna make you a deal.
I wanna tell you you could come down here...
...and I will trade you for all these passengers in the train, how's that?
Okay, you could save the lives of 17 New Yorkers.
Now, that's a good deal.
What do you think?
Give us a moment.
Okay.
I'll give you a moment.
You turn this into a circus, gonna get someone killed.
Now, you entered his world, exit it.
Okay, time's up. What's the deal?
It's a nice offer, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline.
Good. Because if you begged me, I wouldn't give you that deal, man.
You think anyone cares about a philandering asshole like you?
New York would love me to pull the fucking trigger on you.
Hey, Garber. This is the-- This is the guy that's trying to get rid of you.
-Keep talking. -Do you believe this shit?
-Calm-- -You don't think he...
...broke the same rules we broke?
-He knows it, I know it. -Calm him down.
-All right-- -He can eat shit.
-Calm him down. -You're--
-You're breaking up. -He can kiss my ass!
I like the deal. It's a good deal, but--
Fuck you, Mr. Mayor!
Now, I want my fucking money now! You understand me? Now!
-Just tell him the money's on the way. -The money's on the way.
Because he's, like, a used-car salesman, this asshole.
He can lick my bunghole, motherfucker!
One mistake and everyone has something to say.
Was she worth it?
Yes. You have nine minutes. How are you gonna get the money?
They're shutting down every intersection here to Brooklyn.
Phil Ramos, male, Hispanic, 39.
Sentenced two to four years for manslaughter...
...paroled last month from Clinton.
His PO, Justafarro, says he's living in a halfway house in Queens.
He's not an absconder, he made his appearances, his piss has been clean.
But he was a no-show at work today. He didn't call in, nothing.
He knows the system.
The perfect place in the subway to stop the train.
He's been out a month. This wasn't planned in three weeks.
Find out Ramos's cellmates, who worked in the laundry with him.
Call lists, visitors lists ASAP.
105 North Avenue.
-Shit! Look out! -Shit!
The market has tumbled nearly 7 percent...
...as investors continue to react to events....
They just came off the bridge.
Why didn't we send a helicopter for the money?
Now remember what I said about talking through deadlines.
We better have a plan B in case the money isn't there on the dot.
Put him on his heels. He knows things.
-We know things too, right? -Right.
Ask him about Phil Ramos. All right? Just get him talking.
You can do it.
-Hey, Ryder. -The money here yet?
On the way.
Then what the fuck are you calling me for?
Actually, I just called to talk.
Oh, yeah? What do you wanna talk about?
You said that being in the motorman's cab...
...was a little like being in a confessional, right?
Yeah?
I was thinking maybe it's like being in a prison cell too.
What are you trying to say? That if I get caught, I'd better get used to it?
No, I'm just wondering. Maybe you're already used to it.
I'm wondering maybe that's how you meet a guy like Phil Ramos?
How the fuck he know that?
Why don't you tell me? Then we'll both know.
After today's confession...
...you're gonna find your ass in prison too.
Which is my point. I want you to hook me up on the inside.
You know everybody. This way, when I come up with my heist plan...
...you know, I'll cut you in.
I can see I've inspired you. Okay, I got a story for you.
It might help you in prison. You wanna hear it? We got a minute.
I'd like to hear a little story.
So back in the day, when I was a high roller....
When were you ever a high roller?
I told you I fed this city breakfast.
Grits and eggs?
Something like that. Anyway, back in the day...
...I took this chick to Iceland.
Iceland? Is that where all the high rollers go?
Six hours from Kennedy and the nightclub scene is...
...you know, is intense.
I thought I'd take this chick to Iceland.
-What's her name? -Ludvika.
She was Lithuanian. She was an ass model.
She asked you what?
You heard of hand models?
Advertisement? Right, she was an ass model.
She did jeans and, you know, magazines and shit.
Anyway, it was Fashion Week in New York...
...and I took her to Iceland.
Ludvika, Lithuanian, ass model, Iceland, you took her to the ice.
-So what? -Well, for 500 bucks...
...they'll take you on a dogsled ride on a glacier.
-Dogsled? -Yeah. And you know the old saying:
If you're not the lead dog...
-...the view never changes? -Right.
Otherwise, you're always looking at the asshole of the dog in front of you.
Be funny in a minute when I get to that part.
It's funny now.
And it's 8 in the morning, we haven't been to bed yet...
...and we're tooling across this glacier...
...and I got this hangover that's creeping up the back of my neck...
...and guess what I'm looking at?
Obviously you're staring at the ass of the dog in front of you.
You got it.
So this dog, out of nowhere, just lifts its hind legs up...
...and puts them in the harness there...
...and just takes a shit while he's running on his front paws.
So he's dumping and running all at the same time.
Now, that's multi-fucking-tasking if you ask me.
Get out of here. Did it hit you?
Shit always hits you, man.
I didn't know it at the time, but it was profound.
-Profound? You lost me. -Yeah.
Well, you know, when I went to prison later on, which you called...
...I had trouble going to the toilet.
You know, a privacy thing.
And I couldn't take a shit. I was scared shitless, literally.
So you know what I thought of?
-You thought of the dog. -That's right.
I thought if that dog could do what it needed to do, so could I.
Saved my fucking life.
Wow, that is profound.
Keep going.
And, you know, it's--
People adapt. It's like you and I, like today.
We didn't know how it was gonna start.
-Wrong. -Wrong what?
I knew exactly how it was gonna start.
Yeah, but do you know how it's gonna end?
-I'm tired of talking to you, Garber. -Wait a minute.
Call me when the money comes in. You got four minutes.
I don't know what he looks like, but he sounds good.
Fucking talk shit, what are you doing?
He's got a sexy voice though. He'd be my bitch in prison.
Where are we?
Less than 10 blocks away. We'll make it.
Fuck, look out!
Jesus.
Shit. The goddamn money car crashed on 1st Avenue.
Get a radio car, put it on the motorcycles, get it there.
Watch it. Easy.
Here, lean up here.
Hey, get that last bag.
-You got 22 seconds, Garber. -All right, we just had...
-...a little problem over here, that's all. -I don't care.
-Two minutes. -Just tell him it's here.
-How's he gonna know? -I don't think we should lie.
-Tell him the truth. -No, tell him it's there.
Tell him the truth?
He's gonna make me do it.
-Ten, nine, eight, seven, six.... -Tell him the truth or lie?
-Tell him the truth. -Tell him it's there.
-Four, three.... -Tell him it's here.
-It's here. -Two, one.
The money's there, it's at 42nd and Vanderbilt.
Liar! Motherfucking liar!
Seven.
-One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. -Ryder. All right, listen.
-Lucky lady, up. -We made a mistake.
-I think that's him. That's Ryder. -Lucky lady, up.
-Listen to me, it was an accident. -Keep talking.
Ryder, we made a mistake. It's my fault.
-The car crashed. -Tell him something!
-That's why the money's not there. -Up!
-Up! -Wait.
-Fuck, no. -Get up!
Get back in line!
Ryder, like one minute it's gonna take.
Don't do this, for God's sake. It was an accident.
-Come on. -Wait.
It's the only plan I got.
Ryder, listen, it was an accident.
It was an accident, Ryder. We made a mistake.
It was an accident, Ryder! It was an accident!
Come on, motherfucker!
Oh, shit.
God!
Oh, my God.
ESU Team 1 to Sniper 1, do you have a shot?
That's your fault.
I got an easy shot. Please advise.
-Stand by. -Roger that.
Shit!
What the fuck happened?
Accidental discharge. I just got bit by a fucking rat.
It's accidental discharge.
Who? Who got shot? Was it Ryder?
No, it was Ramos.
-Sergeant? The money there yet? -What? Yes, yes.
-Are you there? -Get in here.
Shoot any motherfucker that moves.
-That's an order! -Shit on your orders.
Can you hear me, Ryder?
Okay, now somebody else has to die.
Two people, maybe all of us.
Did you hear me?
I heard you, but you gotta understand, the circumstances...
...they're different now for you.
-You gotta rethink. -No.
You got to adapt.
No, I gave you instructions, and you know the consequences!
I mean, don't you have a plan B?
No, plan B is enforcing plan A!
And the minute you stop believing me, motherfucker, that's it!
I believe you, you gotta believe and understand those cops...
...are gonna be down and next to you any second--
Bring it, man! Let them unload their guns, I don't care!
And what's the point of that? What's the point?
I told you we all owe God a death.
And now it's two minutes past the deadline, two minutes.
Which means two people, almost three, have to go.
They have to die.
The money's there, Ryder. Nobody else has to die.
The money's there.
I don't know what you owe God. I can tell you, you can't pay him in cash.
You never see a U-Haul behind a hearse, Ryder.
The Egyptians tried it. It doesn't work. You can't take the money with you.
Ryder?
You can't take the money with you.
All this talk of God, I think I need to pray.
Give me a minute.
I can do that.
You did good, Walter.
What's the reality of getting in, ending this?
We'd have to be willing to accept heavy casualties.
It's a hard choice, but I say make it.
New York City does not have an acceptable casualty rate.
This is your area, what do you suggest?
We should buy time. So far this son of a bitch hasn't allowed us to.
This might be the first time we got through.
Trust your man? He confessed to a felony 20 minutes ago.
There are people down there who are alive because of him.
Until we change the rules or hope runs out...
...we should stick with the situation we have now.
Do what you need to do.
Hey, Garber, you there?
-Yeah, I'm here. -Speak up.
I'm here.
-I talked to God. -That's good. What did he say?
He said I should trust in him. All others, pay cash.
How soon can you get it down here?
From that station, it would take them about five minutes to walk it down.
-No can do. -About 10 minutes to walk it down.
No, no, no, I mean you, man.
How long would it take you to come down here?
Don't understand. What do you mean?
I mean you. I wanna meet you.
And if you bring it, I know the cops aren't bringing it.
Well, you know, I don't know how I'm gonna carry that money.
-It must weigh.... -Two-hundred and twenty pounds.
Stick it in a wheelbarrow or something.
Why are we discussing weight? Shouldn't you think:
-"Get the fuck out of there"? -Okay, get the fuck out of there.
Good, that's progress. Now, look, plan B. Your idea.
And part of plan B is you, Garber, deliver that money...
...or I kill another hostage, you got that?
You got seven minutes, buddy boy.
You got six minutes and 55 seconds, check me.
Do it!
I check.
And tell that sleazebag negotiator to call me when you've got the money.
You don't have to do this.
Finally somebody got their head out of their ass, huh?
Hello?
Hey, how you doing, baby? What are you doing?
What do you mean, what am I doing? I'm watching the thing, the hostages.
They mentioned you. They said a dispatcher was talking to the terrorists.
Yeah, yeah, they're not terrorists.
They are if they're down there waving guns.
Right, right. Listen, Therese, are you listening?
-I'm listening. -Look, I'm the one that--
You're right. I was the one that's been talking to them.
I knew it. I am so proud of you.
After everything, all this, them trying to fire you.
Them sticking you in a dispatch job and you--
Where are you?
I'm at a heliport.
I'm getting ready to get on a helicopter...
...because they want me to take the money down to the tunnel.
What? Are they crazy?
-It's real simple. There's nothing to it. -Over there.
What it is, is he knows I'm not a cop, so he wants me to come down--
Is it all right if I wait here? Can I wait here?
They need me to take the money down because they know I'm not a cop...
...and, you know, they're saying that he might kill somebody, honey.
Well, then somebody has to die, because you can't.
He's talking to his wife.
I understand, baby. Listen to me. Listen to me.
-Just tell Angela at the meet-- -Let's go!
When she runs over the hurdles.
Tell her to run straight through the hurdles.
-Just like I always tell her, okay? -Come on, we gotta go.
You tell her yourself.
-Now, you listen to me. -Yeah, I'm listening.
Now, you do what you have to do, but we need milk.
So on your way home, I want you to bring a gallon.
Of milk? Okay.
You promise.
Why do we--? Why a gallon? Why not a half a gallon?
Just bring a gallon. A gallon.
Okay. Okay.
I can get a half a gallon, I'll get a half a gallon.
I gotta go.
All right, thanks, guys.
Put your-- Put your headset on.
You ever do anything like this before? You know, go in unarmed?
Yeah. Two years ago, Brooklyn.
Flatbush Avenue. I got the hostages out.
And the guy with the gun?
The guy with the gun, didn't end well for him.
-For the guy with the gun? -Yeah.
It's nice seeing it from this perspective, huh?
You can see what you're fighting for.
I love you so much.
Did you hear me?
Yeah.
Well, do you love me back?
Can't really talk right now.
All you have to say is "Yes."
That's a lot less words than saying, "I can't talk."
I'm having a really weird fucking day.
Oh, God.
If we'd anticipated this, we could have made a lot of money.
What kind of guy would you expect...
...to take a model to Iceland for the weekend?
-An ass model. -An ass model.
-A Wall Street guy. -A Wall Street guy.
He's here!
The one-hour time limit reported earlier has expired.
We're not sure who this is. It could be hostage negotiators or detectives.
Once we have any updates, we'll be back to you live.
-Camonetti. -How are you?
-Mr Garber. -Lieutenant Staley.
-Pleasure. -Got radio set up to the train?
Set up right there.
You can talk to the train or to Rail Control.
Okay. Just do what he says, and remember everything you see.
Let's go.
So who the hell did you fuck to get this job?
Myself. It was easier than it looked.
Yeah, fucking yourself always is.
Pelham 123, come in. Pelham 123, come in.
Who am I talking to?
This is Lieutenant Camonetti. We spoke earlier.
Yeah, you're the greaseball. What'd you do, go out for a pizza?
What's my money doing, man? Where is it?
Mr. Garber is in the tunnel. The money is two minutes away.
Oh, Garber, man. That is a dependable man.
He's a good man too.
Absolutely. How about you, Ryder?
Everybody's got some good in them, don't you think?
Is this where you try to get through to me?
I don't think so, motherfucker. Now I got three instructions for you.
Number one, when this conversation is over...
...I want you to restore the power to the whole sector.
Number two, I want you to clear the local tracks...
...from 68th Street down to Coney Island.
And when I say, "Clear," I don't wanna see no cops.
I want all the lights green.
Don't trip me up with a red, got that?
Absolutely.
And number three, don't play games with me...
...or I'll track you down and I'll fuck you in your greaseball ass, motherfucker!
Over and out.
Let's go.
All right.
-Know how to use one of these? -No.
It's really simple. Okay?
Safety's on, safety's off.
On, off.
Aim at anything you don't like, you pull the trigger.
-What if they frisk me? -We got that covered.
-That's it? -That's it.
It's got a false bottom.
It's gonna be this one. You got that?
-I got it. -Good.
Don't worry about it.
Just don't fuck it up.
Okay.
We got an ID on Ryder.
Dennis Ford. He was released from Clinton Correctional two weeks ago.
Did a nine-year stretch.
The last four on the same cell block as Phil Ramos.
His name shows up on an Icelandic Air passenger list...
...in September of 1998, right after Fashion Week.
Dennis Ford. You remember?
We used his case when he was running as an example of--
The kind of nonsense that we would clean up if I got elected mayor, yeah.
He ran a private equity firm.
His biggest client was the pension fund.
-He siphoned off.... -Twenty-million dollars.
He did a plea bargain for three. The judge gave him 10.
Maybe that's why he's so pissed off.
Judge gave him 10 years because we didn't recover all of the city's money.
Couple million unaccounted for. Seed money.
Seed money? For what?
For today, you play the terrorist card, you panic the market into a drop.
You know it's coming, you make a great deal with $2 million.
-What about the hostage money? -That's nothing...
...compared to the money you could make. Let's get downtown to the SEC.
Check the trades, especially the put options.
-Good luck, Garber. -See you when you get back.
We got company.
Garber.
When you put your socks on this morning, did you ever think...?
Turn around, let him frisk you.
I was worried about you. I thought maybe you'd get lost...
...but then I remembered you were a motorman, so....
These tunnels don't change much, do they?
Just the people in them.
-Are we good? -It's here. We're good.
All right, come on up.
Let's go.
Damn. You're taller than I thought you'd be.
You're good-looking too. Come on, sit down.
It's nice to meet you.
What do you weigh, about, what, 220?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 220 on a good day.
Oh, that's Ramos.
He's what you would have called the brains in the operation.
Dumb fuck.
So how long has it been since you've driven one of these?
-That's why you brought me here? -You're a motorman, right?
Once a motorman, always a motorman.
You play your cards right, you might get a part of the cut.
Well, this is--
It's a new train. I'm not certified on the new trains.
Well, I got faith in you, man. But I'm going to ask you one question.
You know, that thing when you told your wife about the 35 K...
...how did she react?
-We gotta talk about--? -Don't be sensitive.
-I'm not being-- -Did she freak out or what?
She wasn't happy, but she understood.
Well, that's love, right?
No, that's marriage. That's another thing.
You think they're gonna move that train?
Seems like a possibility. How are we with street-level, emergency exits?
I got a blanket.
I got radio cars and a man at every exit from 42nd to South Ferry.
We gotta go.
Hey, Camonetti.
Fucking greaseball, man.
Hey, greaseball, speak up.
I see red. I don't see green.
What's taking so fucking long?
Blanket is not tucked in yet.
Stall him. I need two minutes, buy me two minutes.
Haven't cleared the tracks yet.
Mr. Ryder, we'll be up and ready in less than two minutes.
We're gonna move forward here, okay?
We're gonna move forward, and if we get onto a red signal...
...and the brakes trip up...
...your friend Walter Garber's getting it in the head.
-You got it? -Yes, sir. I got it.
Let's roll, let's roll.
Hope you were bluffing.
Yeah, I'm bluffing, man. You gotta say what you gotta say.
You thought by coming down here, you'd be redeemed, didn't you?
God bless you, Garber.
You're more fucked up than I am.
At least the same fucked up.
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.
Let's go.
She's on the move.
Put some speed on it.
He's by me, headed south. Male, black, at the controls.
Motherfuckers.
You're playing with fire, my man. I wanna see them green.
Turn to green or I'll put a hole in Garber's head right now.
-Do it! -We believe you.
We're moving as fast as we can.
-What happens if they run a red light? -It'll trip the brakes.
Coming up on the first one.
There, that's what I'm looking for. That's what I'm looking for.
Here he comes, right now.
Garber's driving the train. Sniper confirmed it.
What are you saying, he's in on it? There ain't no way.
Sniper killed Ramos, he was their driver...
...they probably need Garber to drive.
They get to Coney Island, they hit the trippers and the brakes will come on.
-Is that 33rd? -Yes, sir.
-How far to the signal? -About a tenth of a mile.
You stop when we get there. We're moving out. You got that?
I'm slowing down now.
Are they slowing down?
They have to. They're coming up to a signal point.
What is that?
You're the old motorman, you tell me.
-She stopped just below 33rd Street. -What the hell are they doing?
Oh, jeez.
Why that little stop?
Train has to stop at signal points.
Some kind of an override?
Yep, some kind of an override, that's right.
There we go. Okay, let's move out. Let's go, let's go.
Roosevelt tunnel, which way?
Which way?
She's moving again. Next stop, 28th Street.
Why that little stop, huh?
-I told you, the signal points. -How do you know...
-...they didn't set the throttle, jump? -We got every exit covered.
There's nowhere to go.
Listen, the throttle can't be set. It has to be held.
It's the failsafe, it's a dead-man's switch.
Doesn't have a hand pressing down on it...
...the train stops cold. Believe me, they're still aboard.
It's going faster.
Emri, off the track. Come on.
Let's go!
Garber, come on.
Come on!
It's gonna derail before it gets to Coney Island.
That's it. That's it right there. Roosevelt tunnel.
It's a fucking train crossover. Come on. Cross over now!
-What? -Come on, move!
Hey!
-Fuck it, let's go! -We gotta find him!
We don't have time! Let's go!
I love you. I fucking love you.
Geo, I fucking love you too.
Hello? Hello?
We're getting calls.
Cops on the platform are seeing passengers...
-...nobody in the motorman's booth. -Believe me, they're still aboard.
It's all right! As soon as we hit a red light...
-...the brakes will stop it automatically. -Yeah, but they're all green!
Four stops away.
Two stops.
Oh, Jesus. The train just stopped.
I really gotta take that piss.
There's no hijackers onboard, just passengers.
Where was that first stop that they made?
Near 34th.
-That's by the Roosevelt spur. -The what?
A derelict tunnel built under the Waldorf Hotel.
Converge everything on that area. Throw a goddamn dragnet over it!
Hey!
Freeze!
Put your hands in the air!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey. Get out, get out, get out.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Out of the-- Get out of the way!
Just go, go, go.
-911 operator. -Hello? Hello?
-This is Walter Garber, MTA. -How do you spell that?
Don't worry about how to spell it.
Just tell Lieutenant Camonetti...
...that Ryder is headed to the Manhattan Bridge!
Cars everywhere. Nobody's going anywhere for a long time.
Hey. Hey!
-Is he in there? -No, no, no.
-No. -Where did he go?
Brooklyn. He said he couldn't wait, he started walking.
This fucking city!
Come on, you guys. Move out!
Ryder!
Don't move.
So is this how you thought the day was going to end, huh?
When you put your socks on this morning?
This make you feel better, Garber?
That make everything okay now?
No! But it's a start.
Don't move.
Don't move!
Hey!
Garber Baby boy, I ain't going back to prison.
I don't-- I don't think you got any-- Any options now or leverage.
Hey!
Hey!
We all owe God a death, I told you that.
You're wrong, Ryder. We owe God life.
Life. And that's the life I gave you back today.
And now you have to give me something back.
What are you talking about?
You got a gun in your hand, I want you to use it. Shoot me.
No, shoot me before they shoot me, or I'm gonna kill you.
I will shoot you. I don't want to, but I will.
-Hey! -I thought you cared.
-No! -You said:
"Ryder. Ryder, don't you have anyone who cares?"
I thought that was you.
-Come on, man, pay it back. -I'm not gonna shoot you.
I'm gonna give you 10, then deal's off.
I got a gun, I'm gonna use it. I'm gonna take your life back.
-Hey! -Come on, man!
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five--
You gonna take this down to zero? Come on, motherfucker, shoot me!
I am not going to shoot you!
Five, four. Come on.
-Hey! -Three.
Police, drop your weapon!
I'm disappointed in you. Two.
You're my goddamn hero.
Drop your weapon!
Mr. Garber.
-Interesting day, huh? -Yes, sir.
You know, just about every day I make a speech...
...and it starts with:
"I'd like to thank you on behalf of the city of New York," blah, blah, blah.
And I never know who I'm thanking or why.
But you...
...did a hell of a thing today.
You went to bat for the city of New York.
And on behalf of me, I'd like to thank you.
Well, you're welcome. I mean, it's been an amazing day.
Everybody's thanking me all day, but I appreciate it. You're welcome.
And I want you to know...
...that tomorrow, the city of New York is going to go to bat for you.
In a big way. You understand?
Yes, sir.
And this city has a very good batting average.
-I appreciate it. -All right.
I'm gonna get home.
Oh, take my car.
-No, no, I'll take-- -Put the siren on and everything.
-There's a siren on there? -Yes.
No, I'll take the subway. But I appreciate it.
-Really? -Yeah.
You know, me, subway all my life. I get home faster than you anyway.
Not you, but, you know, everybody else.
But thank you, sir.
You a Yankee fan?
No. Well, yes. Yes, of course.
We've got a problem.
-A cyber attack? -Yes, Prime Minister.
Took me two bottles of wine
and half a packet of sleeping pills to finally nod off.
And you wake me because some fat-fingered hacker's pinched your PIN number?
Well, it's a little more serious than that, Prime Minister. Mmm.
The identities of every one of our serving agents have been exposed.
What?
-Who's doing this? -We're not sure, Ma'am.
So one week before I host my first G12 Summit,
Britain's entire security apparatus has been taken down
and you know absolutely nothing?
That does pretty much sum up the situation, Ma'am, yes.
Well, you better get someone on it and find me some answers!
Yes, but that's the problem. We don't have any agents left.
Yes, but that's the problem. We don't have any agents left. They've all been outed.
So bring back an old one!
All units, this is Juliet Echo. Stand by for target coordinates.
Target acquired. Repeat, target acquired.
Now then, what have we here?
Sorry, sir. Never mind, Baggaley.
Your concealment and camouflage work is definitely improving.
Thank you, sir.
[boy] Come on. You, too, Ibadulla. Excellent. That is a first-class man-trap.
Excellent. That is a first-class man-trap.
-Six house points. -Yes!
Right, let's get back to school before Matron notices you're missing. [all] Aw.
And don't worry, there aren't any more booby traps.
Apart from this one, of course.
Mr. English?
We haven't seen him, sir.
And that's camouflage.
Hmm.
And go.
And go.
And go.
The welfare of your children is our paramount concern.
They're never exposed to any unnecessary risk, I assure you.
I think that's an "F" for your bomb-disposal coursework, Hattersley.
"You're looking particularly beautiful tonight."
[all] You're looking particularly beautiful tonight.
"Ching!"
[all] Ching!
-Have a good half-term, sir! -Thank you.
[all] Thank you, sir.
Are you seriously telling me this is all we've got?
Most of them are either dead,
having hip operations or recovering from prostate surgery.
Okay.
Before your briefing, we'll need you to re-sign the Official Secrets Act.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
[Agent Seven] Any of you gentlemen remember this?
Oh, the Mont Blanc Blaster. Haven't seen one of those for years.
Take the cap off and, if memory serves, you've 20 seconds to replace it
or it detonates with the force of a stun grenade.
Thank you.
Teas on the left, gentlemen. And coffees on the right.
[Agent Seven] Excellent.
Oh, damn it, I forgot my pills.
[Agent Nine] Here, have some of mine.
[Agent Seven] Scotch whisky, single malt?
[Agent Five] Thank you very much.
Coffee.
Here, let me help you with that.
Tea?
This one just needs a little top-up of hot water.
I'll be right back.
[Agent Seven] Man's a divot of the first order.
Someone should put him out of his misery.
[Agent Nine] Along with whoever -furnished this room. -Oh. [gasps]
Ah! Good morning. Sorry to keep you. [clears throat]
Are the others here?
They, um... They nodded off.
Right...
And who are you, exactly?
English.
-Johnny English. -[Pegasus] Well...
"English..."
You'll leave immediately.
My people will give you the full briefing en route. Is there anything you need?
Yes, nerve gas nasal spray, a type-four exoskeleton...
Yes, nerve gas nasal spray, a type-four exoskeleton... You should probably start a list.
And a garroting watch, with the rubber strap, not the steel bracelet
because the links get caught in the little hairs on my wrist.
Oh, and I'll also need a Bough.
What's a "Bough"?
Sir!
Wonderful to see you!
Yes, all right, Bough. We're going on a mission, not a honeymoon.
Yes, of course, sir.
I think it's the pin of your buckle, sir. It's caught on my jumper.
[English] Yes, I can see what's wrong, Bough.
If you go to your left and I'll go to my right.
I'm sorry, no, if you go to your right and I'll go to my left.
No. If I go clockwise and you go anti-clockwise...
-No, I think that's making it worse, sir. -Hmm. I'm surprised that didn't work.
Good morning, sir. I have your agent activation pack here.
Department-issue smartphone.
580-megapixel camera, 4.7-inch retina HD display.
Ingenious. And what does it shoot? Poison darts?
It doesn't shoot anything. It's a phone.
There's a Twitter handle, Instagram feed
and secure login for the department Uber account.
What's he on about, Bough?
I need a weapon. Not a box of gobbledygook.
I think what Agent English is getting at, sir, is all this is highly trackable.
But since we're dealing with a very sophisticated, digital target,
we might be less visible if we took a more analog, low-tech approach.
Exactly.
I see.
Is there anything else I can get you?
A gun.
We don't really do guns anymore.
Just get him a gun.
[P] Right, a gun.
Right. Haven't actually done one of these before.
"It is my obligation under section 14 of the Health and Safety Directive to inform you
that the equipment with which you are about to be issued
can cause injury and bodily harm.
Furthermore, any agents with nut allergies
should be aware that traces of cashew oil--"
Thank you.
Right, transport.
So, take any hybrid you want.
I'll take this one.
Oh, don't be ridiculous, English. This car is a relic.
Drinks petrol, leaks oil and has no passive,
Drinks petrol, leaks oil and has no passive, let alone active safety features.
[Bough] Do you know what else it doesn't have, sir?
Satellite navigation or a single computer chip.
Making it completely invisible to a digital enemy.
The equipment Agent English requested, sir.
Thank you.
-Phone, Bough? -Yeah.
That hi-tech villain of yours will never see us coming.
[Bough] Let's see what they've given us.
Exoskeleton, exploding cotton buds, the old shoebox inflatable.
Exoskeleton, exploding cotton buds, the old shoebox inflatable. Hmm.
-Oh. What are these? -Instant-Release Super High-Energy Pills.
Like sticking your fingers in an electric socket. Highly recommended.
Right, so, the red ones must be the Total Knockout Sleeping Pills.
-Correct. -Huh.
Probably worth labeling these. Oh!
[chuckles] Look, sir. Sweeties.
[English] Hang on a minute.
I always did love a jelly baby.
I wouldn't if I was you, Bough. "Jelly" is short for "gelignite."
One bite and it'll take the top of your head off along with the roof of the car.
So, what does this do?
It's a mixtape, Bough.
-[English] So, destination? -[Bough] South of France, sir.
That cyber attack seems to have been launched
from the Wi-Fi signal of a hotel in Antibes.
Sir? Sir, I've just had a fax through from HQ.
Background checks on all the guests that accessed the Wi-Fi network.
See? Who needs email?
Um... One name has raised a red flag, sir.
Sebastian Lynch, ex-Army and Military Intelligence.
Now selling his services to the highest bidder.
-Where do we find him? -Directly ahead, sir.
[Bough] He's got an eight o'clock reservation at the Cote de Roc restaurant.
The problem's going to be getting close enough for a full surveillance, sir.
Not necessarily.
Darling, I've just gotta get this. Two seconds.
Simple plan, two parts. You provide the distraction, I'll get the phone.
-Yes, sir. -And from now on...
[in French accent] Perhaps we should sound like French waiters.
[in French accent] French waiters?
Yees.
[in normal accent] Go on.
Are you finished now, Sebastian?
Bread roll?
Yes, thank you.
[Bough] Excellent choice, madame.
[in French accent] Good evening.
How are you?
Bread roll, sir?
Yes. Thank you.
One second.
Excuse me, would you mind?
Yes. Evening.
Evening.
Thank you.
[Sebastian] Where's my phone?
[woman] That is your phone.
Thank you.
Monsieur.
The shell on my wife's lobster, could you remove it, please?
Yees.
Let me crack it for you.
Hello? -Oh! -Oh!
[Sebastian] Steve, I'll have to call you back. Call you back.
Sebastian, don't get involved.
-[woman] What is he doing? -[man] I don't know. He's a fool.
There we are.
Voilà.
Hmm. Bon appétit.
[man] I will talk to the manager. I will talk to the manager.
[English] Textbook, Bough.
[Bough] Just holiday snaps, sir.
Wait a minute. This photo...
It was taken the same day our villain accessed the Wi-Fi, and look.
Scarcely 50 feet from shore.
Whoever was on that yacht could easily have used the hotel's Wi-Fi,
sent that signal, and then just sailed away.
I think it's time we paid the Dot Calm a visit.
[Jason] Algorithms. We are surrounded by them.
Algorithms run our lives,
choose our TV shows, stream our music... even find us a date.
I know this chap, don't I?
Yes, he's that Silicon Valley billionaire who dated a Kardashian.
Two Kardashians, and a Black-Eyed Pea. Keep watching.
But supposing there was an algorithm for an entire country.
A single algorithm that could be applied to every one of its problems.
A single algorithm that could take a second-rate nation and make it...
world class.
Every nation is awash with data.
So now, more than ever, we need to put that data to work, for the people.
These few lines of code will deliver the kind of change
These few lines of code will deliver the kind of change they have been dreaming of their entire lives.
I am Xander. I love data.
He's so clever.
He's young, he's sexy, he's insanely successful.
Just the qualities we need people to associate with me!
Yes, Prime Minister. And they will do, when he starts working with us.
And they will do, when he starts working with us.
But why would a Silicon Valley billionaire work with us?
Just get him into Number 10 and let me work on him.
-Yes, Ma'am. -Go on.
Oh, God, now what?
There's been another attack, Prime Minister.
-[groans] -Air Traffic Control.
Someone's rerouted every flight in Europe to Luton.
For God's sake, tell me the agent you've got in the field is making some progress?
[Bough] So, how are we gonna find the location of that yacht, sir?
[English] Very easily, Bough. We ring MI7.
Hello... hello? Yes, I need the location of a boat called...
Hello? Hello, yes. A boat called the Dot Calm.
Yes, it's a play on words. Yeah.
Yes, it's a play on words. Yeah. -Where? -[line beeping]
[Bough] Looks about half a mile out, sir.
Do we wanna try and swim it, or...
No, Bough. This is a job for the shoebox inflatable.
No, don't open it in the car, sir!
[muffled] Can you reach your door handle?
[muffled] No, sir.
I'll try my side.
Right, Bough, our aim is to get on board without anyone noticing.
And how are we gonna do it?
-Magnetic boots. -Brilliant, sir.
Simple mechanism.
Left switch activates left boot. Right switch activates right.
Okay, let's go.
Remember, the absolutely vital element of this mission is surprise.
Yeah, you have to get up pretty early in the morning to outwit British Intelligence.
Quick!
[woman] Good evening, gentlemen.
Shall we start with your names?
Clearly you have no idea who you're dealing with.
That's why I'm starting with your names.
Actually, would you mind coming down here?
It's really hard to have a conversation like this.
I have a better idea.
It's no good, it won't move, sir.
We'll see about that.
Low-intensity exploding cotton bud.
That's quite a powerful charge for such a small space, sir.
Oh, nonsense.
There will just be a slight pop.
[whispering] Shall we locate the hold and look for the source of that signal?
[shouting] I think we should locate the hold and look for the source of that signal!
-Come on! -[shushes]
[shouting] I'd say we have our villain, Bough!
[whispering] Shh. You need to keep your voice down, sir.
[softly] And we're not going to lose him.
Hand me the Sherbet Fountain.
Three sucks, and the location transmitter is activated.
This gin palace will show up as a hostile from 30,000 feet.
This gin palace will show up as a hostile from 30,000 feet. Hmm.
This is now an enemy target.
Aniseed balls.
If you'd wanted to kill me, you would have already done so.
Till we meet again.
Well, that was sooner than I expected.
[Bough] Who do you think she is, sir?
[English] Well, if she's not the owner of that yacht,
then she knows who is.
Either way, she's the key to this case.
Is it true you were teaching, sir? Before all this blew up?
If by "teaching," you mean
If by "teaching," you mean scouting for potential intelligence operatives, then... yes, I was.
scouting for potential intelligence operatives, then... yes, I was. [Bough] Hmm.
I actually got married, sir. I don't know if you heard.
No.
Yeah, Lydia. Lovely girl.
You never think about getting hitched yourself, sir?
This is no life for a married man, Bough. The danger, the constant travel.
[waitress] Here you go, sir.
More Lydia's life than mine, sir.
She's in the Navy, you see.
What, as a cook?
Or some kind of seagoing secretary or...
Oh, no, sir. She's the captain of a nuclear submarine.
-Oh, right. -Hmm.
Do you think we should get some petrol for the Aston, sir?
No. An Aston Martin is surprisingly economical, Bough.
Besides, it looks like we're in business.
Come on.
[Bough] Looks like an electric car, sir.
Yes, and sounds like a nose-hair trimmer.
A bunch of triple-A batteries is no match for old-fashioned British horsepower.
I'm listening.
They've taken the bait.
-Keep me updated. -Okay.
Look at her cornering. Seems so effortless, doesn't it, sir?
Arm the missile.
The what?
The missile, Bough, the one with the tear gas warhead.
But they're just cyclists, sir. I mean, we'll get past in a minute.
They're French cyclists, Bough,
and they're obstructing Her Majesty's Secret Service.
[Bough] Wiper stalk is armed, sir.
[Bough] Sorry. Terribly sorry. We do apologize.
[English] Stop it, Bough, you'll only encourage them.
-What are we gonna do now, sir? -Patience, Bough.
[English] Driving like that, her battery will be dead any moment.
And she'll roll to a humiliating stop.
Bough, it is your job to keep an eye on the fuel gauge.
Very impressive driving, Mr...
Golightly. Basil Golightly.
And you're rather useful yourself, Miss...
Bhuletova. Ophelia Bhuletova.
And this is...
Colin.
I thought we were using fake names.
[whispers] That is a fake name.
Oh, right.
Yes, this is Colin,
and I'm...
"Dasil."
Dasil. Basil.
Well, Basil,
maybe there is a simpler way of doing this.
Over a drink perhaps?
Well, that would be lovely.
Shall we say the bar at the Hotel de Paris in Cagnes-sur-Mer? Eight o'clock?
Hmm. It's a date.
Well, I think my "running out of fuel" ruse worked pretty well.
[Prime Minister] What?
Junior doctors. They've confirmed they are going on strike
and the tube drivers are coming out in support.
Oh, God. Leader of the Opposition, has he come round from his heart surgery?
Yes, Prime Minister.
Oh, Jesus Christ, when will something go right for me? What do you want?
They've hit us again, Prime Minister.
-Huh? -Hacked into -the Central Traffic Control System. -Ah.
Yes, they've turned every traffic light in London to red.
-Where's my bloody drink? -[cars honking]
You've got to be joking? Vodka tonic, no ice, no tonic.
-Yes, Ma'am. -And Mr. Volta has arrived, Ma'am.
Mr. Volta, welcome to Downing Street.
I have read so much about this wonderful building.
Is this the stone triple staircase designed by William Kent?
Um... Yes, it probably is. I can't swear to it. I mean, I'm not--
-Can we do a quick... -[Xander] Needs Photoshop.
This way.
I am horribly late, I do apologize.
It's the traffic, it's the one thing I don't love about London.
Yes, well, I must admit we are having a slight problem with the lights at the moment. Nothing major.
with the lights at the moment. Nothing major.
If you wanted, I could take a look? It is kind of what I do.
I think it's actually a little bit more complex than--
Xander, get a web address for London's traffic control center.
[Xander] Here is the login page, Jason. Do you have a password?
Um...
-I won't tell if you won't. -Right you are.
[Xander] Bypassing security. Security bypassed.
[sarcastically] That's terrific.
-Someone is hacking you. -Oh, I don't think so.
Denied service attack. Yeah, primitive but effective.
You know what we could try, rerouting all service requests
to our server farm in Nevada.
Um...
[Xander] Rerouting, Jason. Rerouting complete.
Crikey.
So, what was it you wanted to talk to me about?
You, Jason.
[mouthing] Get out.
I want to talk about you.
[English] Excellent, Bough. Nearly there.
[English] Excellent, Bough. Nearly there. Nearly there.
This is actually a really nice hotel, Bough.
I'm turning to the right.
Shall one of us keep Miss Bhuletova busy
while the other one searches her room, sir?
Good idea, Bough. Alert me if you find anything.
Mr. Golightly.
Indeed.
-I thought perhaps you weren't coming. -On the contrary.
Wild horses couldn't keep me away.
Evening. What would you like?
I'm feeling a little homesick tonight. I'll have a Moscow Mule.
And I'll have a London... Lemming, please.
I'm not sure, what...
It's gin, vodka,
armagnac,
sherry,
with just a little bit of Parmesan.
So, what brings you to the South of France, Miss...
Bhuletova.
Bhuletova.
-I'm just visiting a friend of mine. -Hmm.
And would this friend be the owner of the Dot Calm?
[scoffs] Yes, he would.
[Ophelia] And what about you, Basil?
Oh, I'm just here on business.
Although, it's rapidly turning into pleasure.
Oh, I love these.
They're really hot.
Are you all right?
Yeah, it's fine. [continues groaning]
Cheers.
I'm not sure I've ever met a man quite like you, Basil.
Let me clear up the uncertainty for you.
You haven't.
I'm sorry, Basil. I have to get up really early tomorrow morning.
That's a shame.
How did you get on, sir?
Oh, gosh. What a wonderful woman, Bough. Wonderful!
Right.
Charming. Intelligent.
Lovely sense of humor. And obviously, entirely innocent.
Although, I broke into her room and she does have three passports, sir.
Romanian, Bulgarian, Russian. Different name in each.
So she's been married to three different people.
Not unusual in this day and age, Bough.
Well, I also found some garroting wire and two boxes of ammunition.
Well, single woman, traveling alone... You can't be too careful.
You don't think she might be a spy, sir?
A spy? [chuckles]
I think I know what a spy looks like, Bough.
[Ophelia speaking Russian] No trace at all?
[man speaking Russian] We've searched every database we can find...
and it's as if he doesn't exist.
So he's a pro.
What are my orders?
Moscow wants him terminated.
Shouldn't I try and find out what he knows first?
No.
Terminate him.
With immediate effect.
Sir? Sir!
I just got off the phone to P in London.
He's found out who the owner of that yacht is.
Jason Volta!
The world's most powerful Internet billionaire, sir.
And he's in London, right now.
The Prime Minister is personally negotiating a trade deal with him.
Well, what are we waiting for?
[loudly] Do you think we might slow down a little, sir?
What?
Never mind!
[newsreader] With what appears to be another cyber attack,
pressure is mounting on the Prime Minister.
-Every train in England? -Yes, sir.
They're all trying to terminate at Bristol Temple Meads.
Morning, sir!
-You see this, English? -Yes!
Please.
Tell me you've got something I can take to the Prime Minister.
Would the name of the man responsible do, sir?
Excellent, English, yes.
It's Jason...
Volta, sir. Jason Volta.
What?
You're accusing the PM's knight in shining armor?
I'd need hard evidence.
Which...
...is why Agent English is proposing
a penetration of Volta's country estate in Surrey.
Yes, yes, yes, yes...
Well, do what you have to do, English.
But for God's sake, be discreet about it.
Good.
"Virtual reality"?
That's right, sir.
P's built a computer model of the inside of Volta's mansion.
When you put on this headset, it will look and feel as if you are inside the house.
You'll be able to open and close doors, walk up and down staircases,
completely familiarize yourself with its layout.
This floor moves in any direction. So you can walk...
You can walk as far as you want in the virtual world
without ever actually leaving this room.
One thing though, sir.
The experience can be very disorientating.
It's completely immersive and some people lose all track of their actual surroundings.
I think we can pretty much guarantee that's not gonna happen.
I'll just need you to sign the health and safety releases.
Would you excuse me while I find an iPad.
Go with him, Bough. If we don't chivvy him along, we'll be here all day.
Watch out!
[elevator] Doors closing.
Going down.
Hey!
I'm sorry, sir, but you're going to have to leave.
Ow!
Ow! Don't...
[tourist guide] So, we'll shortly be arriving at Admiralty House.
And that actually used to be Oliver Cromwell's own house...
And then we'll be going to Horse Guards Parade.
Perhaps you'd like to sit down, sir?
However, the agent we have on this mission is confident he's making major progress.
And yes, we have a potential suspect, he's been identified.
And further covert investigations are now ongoing.
Yes, quite.
So I expect to have more to announce on this front... Shortly.
[Bough] Sir?
-Is everything all right, sir? -Yes, I've done it, Bough.
Child's play. Don't know what all the fuss was about.
Pleasure to see you again, Prime Minister.
[whispering] It's a hologram. Apparently you just speak to it normally.
The pleasure's all mine.
Hate to rush you, but was there something in particular you needed?
Actually, I was just calling really to see
if you had had a chance to think things over.
[Jason] I have.
But the thing is, Fiona, I just don't really do other people's security.
Not that I don't want to. But your infrastructure is old.
Plus the only way I could keep you secure in the meantime
would be by storing all your data on my own servers.
-Obviously, that would be-- -Yes. Jason,
what I really want to do is announce this tie-up at the G12 meeting.
Do we have a deal?
[Bough] Good luck, sir.
[Jason] Hey.
[man] Sir?
I said to get the chopper ready. Right there.
[man] Sir. Right away, sir.
[Jason] Thank you.
-[man] Tyler, come in. -[Tyler] Copy.
[man] Tyler, can you prepare the chopper now?
[Tyler] We'll have everything ready for you in a couple of minutes.
We can't keep meeting like this, Mr. Golightly.
Oh, yes.
Or do you want to end this charade and tell me your real name?
-[laughter] -Come on!
There's so much you don't understand about this world you've got caught up in.
Spare me the idiot act. You're British Secret Service.
Impressive work in France, by the way. When did you realize I was a spy, too?
Oh, pretty much straightaway.
I've spent two years undercover. Simple operation until you showed up.
And I like to keep things simple.
"Simple" is my middle name.
It would seem you've got a choice to make.
-Temporary suspension of hostilities? -A short-term partnership.
-Agreed. -Hmm.
Politicians are even more gullible than venture capitalists.
[Xander] That is correct.
Get me a copy of the target list.
We'll hit them once more just to be on the safe side.
-Give me your phone. -You don't have a phone?
A phone will give anyone your precise location.
And yet they're so useful for making phone calls.
-[Jason] Excellent. -I'm not phoning anyone.
I'm gathering evidence.
[Xander] The target list, Jason. Four iconic central London landmarks.
[Xander] The target list, Jason. Four iconic central London landmarks. -Make your selection. -Number three.
-Make your selection. -Number three.
The London Eye.
This cyber attack could potentially impact 16,000 visitors.
I found him snooping around upstairs.
And who are you, exactly?
I'm not telling you anything.
[Xander] Face recognition software launched.
Johnny English is a geography teacher from Lincolnshire.
Rather heavily armed for a lesson on European capitals, Mr. English.
Any thoughts, sweetheart?
He's British Intelligence.
And there you have it, two words that have
And there you have it, two words that have no right being in the same sentence together.
Do you really think I came here alone?
I have a team of crack operatives out there, right now,
just waiting to strike.
What has happened to this country?
How is it possible that less than a century ago
the British Empire ruled a quarter of the globe,
and now, it's relying on someone
like you?
Hey! Stop!
Stop him?
Go.
-Close the gates. -[man] Yes, sir.
Help! Stop!
Obstacle directly ahead, Mrs. Trattner.
Check your mirrors and bring the car to a stop.
Excuse me. Hey.
[muttering incoherently] What are you--
Thank you.
Drive!
Excuse me. [Trattner] What... What do you think you're doing?
[Trattner] What... What do you think you're doing? [instructor] Excuse me! You are not a qualified instructor.
[instructor] Excuse me! You are not a qualified instructor.
-[Trattner] But what about my instructor? -Turn left.
Turn right.
For future reference, I'm on your left.
Please, stop. I can't do this anymore!
I can't see anything now!
Good.
-When I say "go," turn sharp right. -Uh-huh.
Three, two, one.
Go!
And straighten up, straighten up, straighten up.
And go!
Let's go. Let's go!
Oh, now just bear left a little. Good.
Straighten up, straighten up.
Good!
Well, that was very good, Mrs. Trattner.
I think you made some real progress today.
[Pegasus] You're not hearing me, English.
Given the Prime Minister's new friendship with Volta, the situation has changed.
But the facts haven't, sir. That attack is Volta's responsibility.
According to you, but not according to anyone else.
[Prime Minister] Is he here yet?
Good afternoon, Prime Minister. So, this is...
English, Prime Minister. Johnny English.
What exactly do you have to say for yourself?
Rather a lot, actually.
However, men like me don't deal in prevarication, Prime Minister,
so let me get straight to the point.
Jason Volta is the man behind these attacks.
And I have the evidence to prove it.
I managed to record this inside Volta's country lair.
But I should warn you, Prime Minister,
that what you're about to see is evil incarnate.
Here we are at Fifi's third birthday!
And it's a very exciting day!
Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray!
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
Thank you.
Can I just ask, what is wrong with you?
The country is in a state of complete chaos.
The press is wetting itself,
and the only person capable of saving us
is the man you're accusing of high treason.
I was in the room myself when he gave the order, Prime Minister!
But there was a...
[Prime Minister] Do you know what I was in the room with, English?
Your file, which I've read, in its entirety, and I have a few questions.
Did you or did you not burn the Cote de Roc restaurant in Antibes to the ground?
And did you or did you not fire a guided missile at a peloton of French cyclists?
Well...
Before commandeering an open-top bus
and tossing the tour guide off the top deck,
and then assaulting an 82-year-old grandmother in a sandwich shop
before battering the employee of said sandwich shop with two organic sourdough baguettes?
I don't remember the--
Do you have any idea how hard it is to be me?
Do you have even the foggiest notion
of how virtually impossible it is to get anything done
in the face of events and facts and voters
and that tsunami of tosspots we call "the national press"?
Finally, I get the chance to do something good for my country,
and what happens?
The universe sends me you.
Well, do you know what I say?
I say, up the universe's arse!
And do you know what else I say? You're fired.
And do you know what else I say? You're fired. With immediate effect. Now, get out!
And make sure I never clap eyes on that imbecile ever again!
[Bough] What are you doing, sir?
What do you think I'm doing, Bough? I'm going home.
But the Prime Minister is finalizing her deal with Volta.
She's taking him to the G12 Summit in Scotland as her special guest.
It's over, Bough. And there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.
But, sir... I have a plan.
Remember my wife?
Clear your baffles.
-What? -Mind your head, sir. Ow!
[English] This says we're sinking.
She's old and a little rusty, but she can put on a hell of a fireworks display.
Excellent work, Commander.
Jeremy has always spoken very highly of you, Agent English.
Who?
Oh, yes. Yes.
I'm no fan of the pen pushers myself,
so when orders came through stationing us here for the Summit,
well, I thought a lift was the least I could do.
Right, let's get a move on, Bough.
Oh. If you wouldn't mind keeping your mobiles off until you're well clear, gentlemen.
The launch systems on the missiles are a bit 1980s.
Gets a tad twitchy around microwave radiation.
No problem there, Commander. We're doing this mission old-school.
This spot is perfect.
Come on.
Sorry, sir. Come on, come on...
Right, Bough. Our mission here is simple.
Gain access to Volta's bedroom, and take him out.
[Bough] How are you going to get up there, though, sir?
A walk in the park for the exoskeleton.
Remotely operated neoprene bodysuit.
Increases the wearer's strength 100 times.
Right, power it up. Stick in the floppy disk and let's go.
Just...
Crikey, sir!
[Jason] When will the weapon be ready?
[Xander] As soon as the Prime Minister signs the agreement, tonight.
[Jason] How do I fire it?
[Xander] Press once, and the attack is launched.
After which, the data of every G12 country
will be transferred to the servers onboard the Dot Calm.
[Jason] Perfect.
Cheers.
You're working for Russian Intelligence and you have been from the start.
Which is why I've taken an antidote to the poison you keep in your ring,
Which is why I've taken an antidote to the poison you keep in your ring, and which you've poured into this drink.
And removed the firing pin from that pistol.
Everyone has to make a life for themselves.
It's just sad that yours is... over.
Fresh from my 3D printer. Hundred percent plastic.
And 100% deadly.
-Killing me won't save you. -[Jason chuckles]
Don't bet on it.
Seriously, this cannot be happening.
Oh, but it is.
Drop the gun.
Get your hands in the air.
And you.
There's no time for this, Johnny.
Oh, it isn't possible.
You cannot be working with this English idiot!
Save the pillow talk for your prison cell, Volta.
-Are you inside, sir? -Yes, yes, Bough, you can power down.
Everything is under control.
-Shut down. -[beeps]
[man] An historic venue for an historic meeting.
The delegates from each G12 member nation will have their own priorities...
How do we get in now, sir?
What's the plan?
[man] Hey, you!
Hey!
Thank you very much. I hope you have everything you need.
On behalf of the United Kingdom, may I welcome you here today to this ancient meeting chamber
may I welcome you here today to this ancient meeting chamber
where the great Scottish clans
once settled their differences and forged new alliances.
A place I have specifically chosen in order to make a very special announcement.
in order to make a very special announcement.
-[English] Oh. Ow. -Sir?
Are you all right, sir?
[English] No, I'm not all right. Get me up, Bough.
-It's very heavy, sir. -[English] I know how heavy it is, Bough.
We've got to get to the conference--
...to the conference room before Volta--
...before Volta triggers his weapon.
And so, with my signature on this agreement...
it gives me great pleasure, oh,
to welcome to you my guest, my friend, Jason Volta.
[Xander] Standing by to launch attack, Jason.
[English] Damn it, get me out of this stuff.
Johnny? -[Bough] I can't see the join, sir. -[English] It's the clasp.
-[Bough] I can't see the join, sir. -[English] It's the clasp. [English] Release the clasp, and the top and the bottom separate.
[Bough] Must have jammed when you fell over, sir.
-For goodness' sake. -Wait. Try this.
That is quite a lot of oil, sir.
Come on! Come on, come on...
Can you imagine what the world would look like if it was run by Apple?
Or Google? Or...
Or Google? Or... Me?
[Jason] Do you think you'd have failing schools?
Do you think you'd have endless waiting in your hospitals?
No.
Think you'd have such long lines in your airports?
-No. -[Prime Minister] No.
No, because all of these are simple data management problems.
And people like me, we love data.
We live for data.
[English] Ha! -My... -[metal clattering]
Do you know what I live for, Volta?
-[Prime Minister] God. -[groans]
Eliminating the threat that lying villains like you pose to this country.
Oh. For God's sake.
Who is he?
Arrest this whack job.
The only person ordering an arrest around here will be me.
There's no cause for concern, ladies and gentlemen.
You are now in the capable hands of Her Majesty's Secret Service.
And you, my friend, are in for an uncomfortable ride.
Where was I?
Living for data.
Exactly.
My algorithms can solve every one of your problems, as long as I have one thing.
Control.
And that is what you are about to give me now.
Jason, I wonder if you could just clarify--
Shut up.
-[crowd exclaims, mutters] -Now, hold on.
[Xander] Castle now locked down
and under your control, Jason.
The agreement this ignoramus just signed
didn't just give me access to all the UK's data.
It also gave me access to a junction box, in North Ayrshire
that connects the entire World Wide Web.
Disable the fiber-optic cables in that box and the Internet will cease to exist.
-[English groans] -Johnny? Are you okay?
Have you got a phone? We need to call for backup.
There's no time for backup. I'm going after Volta.
And don't lose that one!
Do you understand what it means if I turn the Internet off?
Cities will go dark. Planes will fall out of the sky.
Trains will collide. Law and order will break down,
and the world as you know it will be over.
Show, don't tell, right?
[Xander] Initiating attack, Jason.
Taking control of junction box.
Suspending Internet and electricity supply across Britain and Europe.
-Stage one of attack complete. -[all exclaim]
Ladies and gentlemen. I can stop the attack,
as long as each of you signs the same agreement as the Prime Minister,
-giving me complete control. -[clamoring]
Your call.
[automated voice] Welcome to British Intelligence.
Get me Pegasus!
[automated voice] For MI5, press one. For MI6, press two.
-[sighs] -For MI7, press three.
[Xander] Eight G12 signatures now acquired.
Signal the chopper, we're almost done here.
[automated voice] For accounts, press five. -For childcare services, press six. -Come on!
-For childcare services, press six. -Come on!
For more options, press seven.
-[alarm beeping] -What?
[Xander] Only two further signatures required
[Xander] Only two further signatures required to achieve control of G12 nations' data.
All UK data  -now successfully transferred... -[sighs] ...to the Dot Calm.
[automated voice] For Aphrodite, press one. For Pegasus, press two.
Oh, my God.
Dive the submarine. Repeat, dive the submarine.
-Director's office? -This is Johnny English.
I need to speak to Pegasus immediately.
-It's a national emergency. -[telephone ringing]
One moment, please, sir.
This is HMS Vengeance.
We have a full launch code. Repeat, launch code is locked.
Do I have your permission to fire?
Oh, my God. Could you hold on one moment, please?
Sir? Sir!
Hello?
Hello?
Sir! HMS Vengeance here. Do I have your permission to launch?
[English] What? Listen, we have to call in an attack.
-[Lydia] Did you say "attack," sir? -Yes, an attack. Attack!
General quarters, we are go for launch.
Target coordinates locked, Commander.
Hello?
Hello?
[officer] Commander, the missile is being redirected.
It seems to be locking on to a new hostile target.
What's a "Sherbet F"?
-[man] Oh, my God! -[woman screams] What was that?
[Xander] Dot Calm appears to be offline, Jason.
The cyber attack has been halted.
Did you... make a call quite close to the submarine, sir?
[Bough] Because...
You did it, sir!
Mission accomplished!
Well, exactly!
[Xander] I am reevaluating our options, Jason.
[Ophelia] Johnny! Johnny!
Volta is getting away! He's heading for his helicopter!
No, Bough.
This one's mine.
Careful, sir. Sir?
Last two steps, sir.
Not so fast, Volta!
Is this supposed to scare me, Sir Lancelot?
[English] Take cover, Bough.
Don't worry, he's only got six bullets in that thing.
And, of course, the thing itself.
You've run out of options, Volta.
Oh, you think you've won?
[Xander] Rerouting the attack to our Nevada servers, Jason.
The world's going down, English. And I'll be the last man standing.
Goodbye, English! Goodbye, Internet.
I've got it! That's a Gazelle 341 light attack helicopter.
If we can hack into its operating system,
we can disable the drive function.
Here.
Look at you! You couldn't use that thing if your life depended on it!
Let's get outta here.
Get this steel bird in the... [grunts]
[Xander] Rerouting complete. Attack data now installed at our Nevada servers.
Should I initiate?
Jason?
Should I initiate the new attack?
Initiate this!
[Xander scrambling] Jason.
[Prime Minister] Well, ladies and gentlemen. I think we can all agree, that wasn't quite the evening we were expecting.
I think we can all agree, that wasn't quite the evening we were expecting.
I had hoped to present to you tonight...
-[softly] Thank you. -...a vision of what Britain might be.
But, as it happens, the man who saved us all this evening,
the man who, I might add, I personally assigned to this case,
has presented us with a different kind of vision.
A living embodiment, if you like, of those fundamental British qualities
that have ensured that our beloved island nation endures.
Courage under fire, endless ingenuity,
and above all, a quiet... unassailable dignity.
Thank you.
All together.
Welcome back, Mr. English.
Thank you, Headmaster.
Thank you for agreeing to be our guest speaker.
Now, the governors and staff are all waiting for us in the rose garden.
Yes, if you could just excuse me for a few minutes, Headmaster.
-Morning, sir! -Hello, sir!
Welcome back, sir!
Surprise!
Thank you.
-Where's Straker? -[Straker grunts]
-Here, sir. -Good.
And, of course, Baggaley.
No, but very good. Very good. All right, gather round, everyone. Gather round.
I've got some toys to show you.
-[all exclaiming] -There we go.
There we are. There we are.
-Breadstick blowpipe, anyone? -[all] Me!
-Breadstick blowpipe, anyone? -[all] Me! There you go.
-Granny Smith hand grenade? -[children] Mine.
-And what about a garroting watch? -Here, sir.
There you go.
Here, let me take that.
Don't worry, it's only a mild sedative.
Oh! That's just a five-second fuse.
Yes, all right, we all know what garroting looks like.
-[coughs] -Whenever you're ready, Mr. English.
Oh, I'm sorry, Headmaster, I'll just be one moment.
Just take those back. Thank you. Ooh!
WARDEN: James McCullen, you Scottish pig,
you've been found guilty of treason for the sale of military arms
to the enemies of our Lord, King Louis XIII,
even whilst you sold arms to our Lord himself.
Your king is a vile bag of filth who murders his own allies.
(GROWLS) I should have charged him double.
You tried to overthrow the Crown in conspiracy with its enemies.
Unlike your simpleton king, his enemies know
that it is the true McCullen destiny not simply to supply arms,
but to run the wars!
Do you have anything else to say before the sentence is carried out?
Yes, I do.
Clan McCullen is far greater and more powerful
than any of you could ever imagine.
My sons will continue to rise long after I am gone,
as will their sons
and, God willing, their sons.
It shall not end with my death!
We are not going to kill you, McCullen.
We're going to make an example of you!
So that no man, woman nor child may ever see your treacherous face again,
you shall wear this mask for the term of your natural life.
No! No! No! No!
McCULLEN: For nearly four centuries, my ancestors have been
the greatest creators of weaponry in the world.
But perhaps in this century, I'll outdo them all.
Nanomites, perfect little soldiers
originally developed to isolate and kill cancer cells.
But at MARS Industries,
and with the help of a little NATO funding,
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) we discovered how to program them to do almost anything.
For example, eat metal.
Watch this test of the world's first nanomite warhead.
Each of these warheads contains 7 million nanomites
and has the ability to eat anything from a single tank
to an entire city.
As you can see, it quickly converts to eating any and all material in its path.
Once unleashed, the nanomites will not stop, ever.
Once the target has been destroyed,
the launcher triggers a kill switch unique to each warhead
that short-circuits the nanomites, preventing any unwanted destruction.
Gentlemen, I'm pleased to announce that tomorrow morning,
your first order of nanotech warheads ships from my factory in Kyrgyzstan.
MAN ON PA: Weapons case on the move. ETA two minutes to NATO team.
DUKE: All right, listen up. NATO wants the best of the best.
That's why we're here. We got Panthers front and back.
RHINO's carrying the package in the middle.
Minimum distance at all times. Apaches are covering us from overhead.
Detail, attention. Fall out, boys.
MAN: Captain Hauser, Mr. McCullen requires a signature.
Not gonna explode, is it?
They're not weaponized yet, and the kill switches are inside.
All the same, I'd avoid potholes if I were you.
-Hey, Bill? -Yeah?
Put that in the RHINO, would you?
All right, ladies! Mount up!
Okay, Apaches, we're heavy, so keep your eyes open.
Roger that. Skies are clear all the way to Ganci.
Hey, Duke, I've been thinking. You know, I warned you about that.
I've been thinking about where we should transfer to.
-Don't say the Air Force. -The Air Force!
What did I say? I thought we were done with this conversation.
You were done with this conversation, not me.
You know, I've been flying
-since I was 13 years old. -Thirteen years old.
You know, I don't think your dad's crop-duster counts as hours logged.
RIP: I'm talking jets, man. Jets.
And you know I qualify every time we're on leave.
-You want to get up in the air? -Yeah.
I'll buy you a trampoline. I filled out the application.
Really? They accept those in crayon?
Come on, dude. Give me one good reason why not.
'Cause I want to be on the ground, in the fight, not flying over it.
ON RADIO: Pioneer 1, this is Pioneer 2, going night vision.
Roger that. MAN ON RADIO: Go ahead and back off. Give me some separation.
MAN ON RADIO: Go ahead and back off. Give me some separation.
ON RADIO: Pioneer 1, this is Pioneer 2. Going NVS.
MAN: Roger.
RIP: Hey, Duke, weren't we supposed to meet up
with the recon team at 40 klicks?
DUKE: Yeah. So? Well, we just passed kilometer 41.
Eyes out, eyes out! Sweep's still clear, sir.
Roger that. There's nothing up here but us.
Tom, put a self-test on the flare and start to scan for...
Holy...
What the hell is that?
Pioneer 1, you've been hit.
DUKE: No!
-Bird down! Bird down! -Back up! Back up! Back up!
All units, we are under attack! They're after the warheads!
-Pioneer 2, engage! -Put that asshole on the ground!
-Pioneer 2, engage! -Put that asshole on the ground! MAN: Roger that. Put the hurt on this guy!
Tommy guns. Firing, firing, firing!
-Missiles armed. -Match and shoot.
Match and shoot! Missiles off!
They shot him right out of the air.
Oh, my God.
Pioneer 2 is down! We've lost our air!
They're boxing us in! DUKE: All units, fan out! I repeat, all units, fan out!
I want SAMs on that thing! Light him up! Light him up!
He's coming around. Get those .50s on him!
Incoming!
RIP: Hold on!
(RIP GROANS) You okay?
Yeah, but my leg is pinned. What the hell was that?
DUKE: Come on, we gotta get in this fight.
RIP: Careful, my leg! Come on, buddy, let's go. Let's go, get up, come on!
Duke, you gotta protect those warheads!
Shut up! I gotta get you out of here first!
MAN ON RADIO: Fire at the opening! Right side, right side!
DUKE: Get up, get up, get up, get up!
RIP: My damn leg!
-You wait here, okay? -Where are you going?
I gotta go get that case.
Air Force, right.
Don't move!
-Hello, Duke. -Ana?
Now, you have to admit, you had that coming.
DUKE: Ana!
Ana!
Bye-bye.
DUKE: Ana! Ana!
Don't make me shoot a woman.
Incoming!
(GUNS COCKING) Stand down. Stand the hell down!
-Put the weapon down, sir. -We're not the enemy.
Pointing your weapons at me doesn't make you my friend, now, does it?
Please hand over the case, sir.
I don't know you, and I sure as hell don't know who they are,
and until I find out, I'm not lowering anything
and I ain't handing anything over.
If it weren't for us, you'd be out there with the rest of your boys.
-So hand over the case. -RIP: What's your unit?
SCARLETT: That's classified.
Someone would like to have a word with you.
State your name and rank.
-You first. -My team just saved your life, son.
This is the part where you get to say thank you.
Those aren't the words that come to mind right now.
I wasn't told anything about any support for this mission,
so why don't you tell your team to stand down?
We could turn this into one big turkey shoot.
Yep.
(IN STRAINED VOICE) Or not.
Easy, Ripcord.
-How do you know me? -Expert marksman,
second in your battalion. Weapons specialist, jet qualified.
-I told you. -Not now, Rip.
My name is General Clayton Abernathy. Perhaps you've heard of me, Duke.
General Hawk. Afghanistan, NATO forward command.
Yeah, that was my last job. -I'm in a whole new outfit now. -DUKE: Uh-uh.
Hey, I just need to deactivate the tracking beacon for security.
Put down that weapons case, son, and let us deliver those warheads.
No way. I signed for them.
It's my mission, my package. I carry them, I deliver them.
Well, that's just fine, but you seem to be a little short of transportation right now,
so my Team Alpha will deliver you to me.
And where exactly are you, sir?
Come see for yourself.
(RIP GROANING) I thought all you Special Ops guys were tough.
We are tough. But we're also sensitive.
I got it. Thanks.
Wow, this is some primo stuff here.
Hey, bro, you got some real lifelike hair over there.
(GROANS) And a kung fu grip.
-SCARLETT: Lie down. -RIP: Okay.
What kind of outfit is this, anyway?
It's not regular Army, based on all the accents.
You're British. What are you, French North African?
Morocco. Where were you born?
(LAUGHS) Duke wasn't born. He was government-issued.
What about you? -He doesn't speak. -Why?
-He doesn't speak. -Why? He doesn't say.
He doesn't say. So, somehow you're all in the same unit,
but one you can't tell me the name of, right?
We'd get tossed for telling.
You're gonna go after those guys that hit my convoy, huh?
Well, whoever you are and whatever this unit is,
I want in.
General.
-What's up? -HAWK: Good job, Joes.
Outstanding.
Welcome to the Pit, Duke. I've read a lot about you two.
Well, you can't believe everything you read. See, I actually...
I understand we even tried to recruit you a few years back.
I never got asked to join any Op group. Really? You don't remember Thailand about four years ago?
Really? You don't remember Thailand about four years ago?
Right before you broke up that bar?
About four years ago, my boy had issues.
I mean, his issues had issues.
DUKE: I've been in the military my entire life
and I have never seen a tac operation like this.
HAWK: All right, you trusted me, I guess I'll trust you.
Technically, G.I. Joe does not exist, but if it did,
it'd be comprised of the top men and women from the best military units in the world, the alpha dogs.
from the best military units in the world, the alpha dogs.
When all else fails, we don't.
Ten nations signed on in our first year,
working together, sharing intel. Now we have 23.
-What's that? -Camouflage suit.
It photographs everything behind you and puts it in front of you. (WOMAN GRUNTING)
Mr. McCullen is standing by, sir. Patch him through via TelePresence.
-DUKE: So who hit us? -COVER GIRL: Currently unknown.
SCARLETT: But one thing's for sure,
she's got highly classified intel and state-of-the-art weaponry,
which means there's a whole hell of a lot of money behind her.
Their capabilities are beyond anything we've ever encountered.
Yeah, that's the one and only reason why we got our asses kicked out there.
We need to find out everything we can about her.
Knowing is half the battle.
Gentlemen, Mr. McCullen,
CEO of MARS Industries and the builder of these warheads.
General, clearly you were the security option I should have chosen.
What did you just say? My team did everything we could out there,
and a lot of good men went down. Yeah, but not you.
That mission was classified, so clearly someone sold us out.
I spent 10 years and 13 billion euros creating these four warheads.
Your job, Captain, was to protect them,
and if it wasn't for General Hawk, you'd have failed.
That's not a fair assessment. He followed his orders to the letter.
Well, that wasn't enough.
Now, so the bastards who attacked you can't find you,
you need to disable the tracking beacon hidden in the case.
We already have. Good man.
But allow me to check them to see if any have been damaged.
Open it, please.
My scan says they're intact, sir.
What's the code? 5-2-9-4-4-0.
(THANKING IN FRENCH)
Please keep me informed of your progress, General.
SCARLETT: Breaker?
My voice analyzer on that guy was going up, down and sideways.
Looks like McCullen's working an angle he don't want us to catch.
McCULLEN: We're on a deadline. We need those warheads now!
You knew that! Ten years setting this up,
wringing money out of NATO, this was supposed to be the easy part.
If you had let me stage the assault at your precious factory,
I could have contained the situation.
And lost the trust of our clients in the process.
It had to be NATO's fault!
What happened?
Did you hesitate when you saw him? (SCOFFS) No.
This had nothing to do with him.
Forgive my jealousy.
Have you tracked the case?
They, of course, deactivated the homing beacon.
I gave them a code to quietly reactivate it.
It's in Egypt. The Pit, only mentioned in whispers.
I will get those warheads back.
I hope so.
If I were really there, I might actually let you touch me.
I'll send a jet. (CLICKING TONGUE) Business first.
Besides, I'm married, remember?
If you had sent me in the first place, it would already be done.
I'm sending you now, Storm Shadow. No more mistakes.
The schedule mustn't be compromised any further.
Keep your eye on her for me.
American politics, governors, senators, congressmen.
No wonder nothing ever gets done.
That's what we're going to fix, Mr. Zartan.
DOCTOR: The king cobra, magnificent creature.
Nature's Grim Reaper and symbol of lethal purpose.
Unseen until it strikes.
Its venom can kill a full-grown elephant with a single bite.
Very nice. So far we've created 20 Neo-Vipers.
Nineteen stand before you. Is it working?
DOCTOR: We injected 1,000 cc of the nanomite solution into each subject.
When they finally stopped screaming,
brain scans showed a complete inactivity
of the self-preservation region of the cortex.
English, Doctor?
They feel no fear.
Cortical nerve clusters show complete inactivity.
They feel no pain. Concepts of morality are disengaged.
They feel no regrets, no remorse.
The nanomites join together as a fighting mechanism,
first blocking, then expelling the cobra's venom.
And they're completely obedient?
Of course.
The real-world applications are endless.
So, you tell me, is it working?
Send a team to rendezvous with Storm Shadow and the Baroness.
DOCTOR: Consider it done. The Joes will never know what hit them.
The 20th Neo-Viper is already set up in Washington, DC
and awaiting your signal.
You've done well. You've thrown the caber clear out of the yard.
Construction of the presidential bunker has also been completed.
Now, if we sold one warhead on the black market,
I could continue my research.
I appreciate your thirst for knowledge, Doctor,
but this world is messy enough. No.
What it needs is unification, leadership.
It has to be taken out of chaos by someone with complete control.
Beijing, Moscow, Washington...
When these missiles detonate,
the world will turn to the most powerful man on the planet.
When I'm finished, the money will take care of itself.
You'll be able to do all the research you want.
We grabbed this image from one of our tactical cameras.
Now we're running her face through an infinity scan.
-Hey, isn't that... -(SHUSHING)
We have access to any photograph on any server, anywhere in the world.
Yep. Everyone gets photographed in some way at some time.
Football game, ATM machine, airport...
We'll find her, and then we'll find out who sent her.
From NATO, sir. Are you okay?
What happened to her?
HAWK: Hmm. Well, it appears that I've been made official custodian of the warheads.
Looks like your mission is complete here, Duke.
When you move them, she's gonna come after you. You know that, right?
And with her intel and toys, she'll find you.
What's your point?
You're going after her first and we want in.
General, it was our team that got wasted out there. We deserve payback.
You don't ask to be part of G.I. Joe. You get asked.
You scouted me four years ago. Now I'm ready. Let's have at it.
Well, I've lost men, too, Captain.
-If you want revenge... -I know her.
Excuse me?
You said knowing's half the battle, right?
Well, I know who she is.
She was a blond. Her name is Ana Lewis.
I could tell you everything you need to know about her,
up until the last four years.
After that, obviously, a lot of things have changed.
Finally, my wife is home.
Hello, Daniel. How was your meeting with the Minister of Defense?
He was thrilled. The accelerator performed flawlessly.
I wish you would have been there.
You and your little lab rats are so clever.
BARON: How was Monte Carlo? ANA: I didn't get what I was after.
I suppose I should be grateful. Most husbands would be.
Most husbands don't have such mysterious wives.
They know exactly where they are and what they do.
They think they know.
Ana, I don't wanna fight. I missed you.
Well, I never tire of a good fight.
But not with you, darling. Let me freshen up and I'll meet you downstairs.
I do love you, my beautiful Baroness.
McCullen gave me orders to kill the Baron if he so much as touched you.
Well, he's my husband. Of course he touches me.
And besides, his work at the lab goes much better after we've touched.
And that's the important thing.
So what are you doing? Spying on me?
If I was spying on you, you would never know.
Getting closer.
You were my best student.
I'll be coming with you to retrieve the warheads.
We go at dawn.
Come on, Ana.
Okay, so, I've been wanting to do this before we deploy.
Duke, it's beautiful. It's too beautiful.
I'm only going to buy one of these, so why not?
So what do you say?
Say yes, you idiot. He's a real American hero.
Thanks for ruining the mood, Rex.
I apologize. I just came to offer you a ride back to post.
What? It's time already?
Yeah, we got to go at 0500. (SIGHS) Is it...
Yeah, it is, right? That's why you're pulling Rex out of the lab.
Ana, look, I'm sorry, but I can't... Yeah, yeah, classified, top secret,
you'd have to kill me if you told me, blah-blah-blah.
And speaking of classified information, you still haven't answered me.
Yes. Yes. Of course it's yes.
On one condition.
You have to promise me that you will not let my genius,
egghead brother get hurt.
He's the only family I've got left.
Promise me, Duke.
I promise.
RIP: Hey! My three favorite people. DOCTOR: Mr. Weems. Good, man?
-Yeah. -Look.
(CHUCKLES) Wow. Nice rock. That's a lot of love.
-Are you proposing? -I'm actually done proposing.
I already said yes. Oh, my God! Congratulations!
Beautiful! You guys are like the little white couple on the wedding cake.
How cute. Give me some love.
Congratulations. Wait. It's not official.
-ANA: What? -RIP: It's not official.
Not until you answer my question. Okay.
Do you love my boy?
Always and forever.
You may have blackmailed your way onto this team.
Doesn't mean I've got to like it.
But it does mean I've gotta get you mission ready,
Joe style.
Standing in front of you are Delta-6 Accelerator suits.
-What does it accelerate? -You.
It'll make you run faster, jump higher and hit harder than any of your enemies.
Let's suit up.
Head-to-toe hydraulics and highly pressurized pneumatics.
An advanced cybernetics heads-up display helmet,
which feeds into the suit.
You think it, it does it.
Twin gas-propelled grappling spears
and triple-explosive, heat-seeking, fire-and-forget rockets.
And my personal favorite,
a 10-millimeter caseless Gatling submachine gun,
capable of firing 50 rounds per second. Fully self-contained firepower.
Perfect for a couple of cowboys like you.
(GASPS) I just missed everything you said. Hey, how do I look?
-Pretty cool, huh? -Any questions?
HEAVY: Yo, Sergeant Stone.
Are they Joes? Hell, no. They're jokes.
Boys.
You're gonna need these.
Just so you know, when I get a target in my sights,
(IMITATES GUN FIRING) I take it down.
Oh, shit!
-Again. -Again?
Just so you know, some targets are harder to hit than others.
Again. You're gonna need that helmet.
(SOLDIERS CHEERING) Stand down, Snake Eyes.
All right. Walk away. It's over. It's like pay-per-view.
I'm nasty with it!
You missed one.
Come on. That gotta be some kind of a record or something.
The record is all 20 killed. Who did that? Let me guess.
-Snake Eyes? -No. Me.
If you're gonna shoot at something, kill it. Otherwise, take up knitting.
HEAVY: Beginner's luck. Stay focused.
-Again. -Again?
STONE: Ah-ah-ah! I have never seen Snake Eyes take a hit.
They're Joes.
Maybe.
Let's go.
Hey, man, Breaker told me that Scarlett graduated college at 12 years old.
She's like some freaky little deadly genius.
(GRUNTS) Rip. I get it, Rip. You like her. Sorry, my bad.
To hell with it. Rip. Rip.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Into the valley of death rode the 600.
Hey, what are you doing? A little beach reading?
Okay.
Look, I think you and me got off on the wrong foot.
See, I'm attracted to you. And you, you're attracted to me.
And him, the damn Zen master,
he creeps me out. What I'm trying to say is...
We're attracted to each other. Thank you!
That's what you're saying. It's not what I'm saying.
It's not?
So, what are you saying?
Attraction is an emotion. Emotions are not based in science.
And if you can't quantify or prove that something exists, well,
in my mind, it doesn't.
Okay. I'll get back to you on that one.
HEAVY: Attention! General on deck!
At ease. Duke,
you scored in the top half percent of all people we've ever tested.
Rip, if we average your scores with Duke's, you pass, too.
-Welcome aboard. -Thank you, sir.
Provisionally, of course. Thank you, sir.
Sir, sensors detecting seismic activity to the southwest.
Probably just a tremor, but have a team check it.
ANA: There's our little weapons case.
STORM SHADOW: All right. You three, guard the machines.
Sorry to disturb you, sir. That's all right, Corporal.
I need you to sign here, here and here. And also here, here...
(GASPS) ZARTAN: Goodbye, sweetheart.
Oh. That's right. You don't kill women.
For you, Zartan, I'd make an exception.
Warheads, Rip! Come on!
MAN: Go, go!
(SCREAMING) We've got the warheads. Prep the Mole Pods for evac.
We're on our way. NEO-VIPER ON RADIO: We're already on it.
ANA: Now how do we get out of here? STORM SHADOW: Follow me.
Like that's gonna happen.
Find the control room. Open the exterior hatch.
-And secure this area. -NEO-VIPER 1: We're on it.
Clear.
MAN: Go, go!
ANA: Can you fly one of these things? Don't move! Ana, put the case down.
Fine. Done.
Stop. Ana, stop right there.
-You can't shoot me, can you? -I will if I have to.
Deep down, you're still the same man I fell in love with.
Don't force this. What could have been. Right, Duke?
(GUN COCKING) Just give me the case, God damn it.
Move and I'm gonna blow her away. Do it. You already killed me once.
RIP: Duke, watch out!
Ana, drop the case!
Hello, brother.
Damn!
Eat this!
DUKE: Hey, genius!
ANA: See you, Duke.
(WHISTLES "FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW") PRESIDENT: How many warheads? WOMAN: Four, Mr. President.
Any threats? Demands? None so far, sir.
We take this to mean the terrorists are unfocused.
-No clear goals. -PRESIDENT: No.
It means they intend to use them.
MEDIC: General Hawk is stable now,
but he won't be conscious for another day or so.
He's one tough bastard.
Hey.
-You all right? -I'm fine.
I didn't want anyone to see me like this. Why?
I don't know. All the men we lost, General Hawk wounded,
my neck just doesn't seem important.
You almost lost your life out there. You have a reason to be concerned.
First fight I lost since I was a kid.
My father taught me to win.
Look, I don't see how you could teach anybody to win everything every time.
I mean, look at you.
You're still here, right?
You get knocked down, you get back up.
Maybe that's what he wanted you to learn.
But then again, that would be an emotional response,
one that can't be explained or quantified.
Hey. Looks like we're all seeing ghosts today, huh?
(STORM SHADOW SPEAKING KOREAN)
Storm Shadow!
(SPEAKING KOREAN)
English, Storm Shadow. Where are your manners?
He is hungry.
We need to invite him in and show him the path.
He is a cur, a weakling! He does not fight like one.
Now, what shall we call you?
This belonged to an ancestor of mine.
He was caught selling arms to both sides.
The French forced him to wear it for the rest of his life.
They called him Destro, destroyer of nations.
So why do you keep it?
So that I never forget the most important rule in dealing arms.
Let me guess. Never sell to both sides?
Never get caught selling to both sides.
Take the warheads to Paris. Have them weaponized.
-Then I want you to test one. -Test one?
We'll let CNN show the world how well they perform.
Fear is a great motivator.
I have a target in mind, one the French will never forget,
as I've never forgotten what they did to Clan McCullen.
Are you ready, Mr. Zartan? Born ready, Doctor.
This is going to be the achievement of a lifetime.
Yes, as a master of disguise, you have no equal, my friend.
Eighteen months of studying my target, learning mannerisms,
but the devil is in the details.
Gentlemen, let's get it going.
One more thing.
I'll control my own brain, thank you very much.
Let's do this.
ZARTAN: Wow. That was a bit nasty. DOCTOR: Think so?
Let's run some tests.
Eye color. Skin tone. Hair follicles.
And initiating facial reconstruction tests.
We gotta find out who's holding their leash.
With their weaponry, financing and intel, these guys are high-line pros.
That limits the possibilities.
Hey, the weapons case. What?
Remember, McCullen had us open the weapons case?
-What about it? -I bet you he gave us a code
that reactivated the tracking beacon.
You're right. McCullen, that son of a bitch.
So, McCullen uses NATO to fund his R&D
and then he steals the warheads back.
And who says you're not a thinker? Hey, I found her.
DUKE: Yeah, that's her all right.
Her name is Ana de Cobray. Baroness, if you're feeling formal.
RIP: Baroness? Wow, she really traded up, huh? Financially, of course.
-DUKE: Who's he? -BREAKER: Daniel de Cobray.
Big shot French scientist. Runs a lab in Paris.
SCARLETT: Lab? What kind of lab? BREAKER: Particle accelerator.
Oh, my God. They're going to use him to weaponize the warheads.
Well, that's where she's going.
I like croissants.
-DUKE: Go, go, go, go! -SOLDIER 1: Come on! Let's go!
DUKE: Pull up on the truck!
SOLDIER 1: Go, go, go!
SOLDIER 2: Two o'clock! DUKE: Go, go, go, go, go! SOLDIER 1: Go, let's move!
DUKE: Go, go, go, go, go! SOLDIER 1: Go, let's move!
-SOLDIER 3: In the alley! -SOLDIER 4: Get down, get down!
You see them?
SOLDIER 5: Two more on the left! SOLDIER 6: Get down!
-Dubble Bubble? -It always helps me.
(DUKE LAUGHS) Yeah. Hey, you good?
-Yeah? -Yeah.
All right, Mr. Science Officer, you're up, okay?
You don't find it in four minutes, you get out of there.
That house will not be there in five. I already called for the air strike.
Come on! Here we go!
I got you! Go, go, go, go!
Oh, crap!
SOLDIER 7: Rooftop!
Hey, Duke, I gotta level with you.
I hate it when you level with me. It's going to be a long five minutes.
No, no, no! It's too early. It's too early!
-Duke! -Rex! Rex!
Rex.
RIP: Duke! Come on. We gotta go.
-I gotta get Rex. -We gotta go, man!
Black Hawk's waiting! We gotta go! Nothing you can do!
-Nothing you can do, man! Come on! -I gotta get Rex.
Ready. Aim. Fire. (GUNS FIRE)
Forward, march.
Are you going to sign in or shall I?
Ana?
Who is this?
Hey! What are you doing? What's going on here?
Hey! What are you doing? What's going on here? I need you to do something for me and I don't have much time.
I need you to do something for me and I don't have much time.
What are these things?
They're warheads, dear.
And I need you to weaponize them for me, or we'll kill everyone in here.
(GASPS) Hey! This is a civilian laboratory!
We don't have the correct programming protocols for weaponizing!
The protocols are in the case. I told you, I don't have much time.
BREAKER: Hey, is that Dubble Bubble?
-But it's my last piece. -BREAKER: Mmm-hmm.
Come on, give it to me. All right, there you go.
HEAVY: All right. Stick to the plan. Scarlett, Snake Eyes, take the front.
Rip, Duke, take the back. Breaker will be our eyes and ears.
I'll give the orders from here.
You do what I say, when I say. Got it? Yes, Daddy.
(BARON SPEAKING FRENCH)
BARON: Here.
-They're all alive. -Merci, Daniel.
I told you I'd kill him if he touched you again.
I heard you the first time.
Okay, we're almost there. Scarlett, you better put your suit on.
That's her.
HEAVY: Take that Hummer, Snake!
Careful. They're worth millions of dollars each.
Careful. They're worth millions of dollars each. Millions of dollars. Got it.
-Jesus. -My bad. My bad. Won't happen again!
Thanks a lot, buddy!
Come on, Scarlett, babe. You in or out? We gotta get in this fight!
Tracking signal is good. Don't let go of that truck, Snake Eyes.
ANA: Let's get that bastard off the roof.
RIP: Look out!
Whoa! Hey, Heavy, it's getting thick out here!
HEAVY: Yeah, I know. They're driving right into the heaviest traffic.
What kind of escape route is that?
Maybe they're not trying to escape. Maybe they're heading somewhere.
-Possible target? -Yes.
Some place with a lot of metal.
They're going to blow it up. All units! Guys, you have to stop them!
-Yeah, we're working on it. -I mean right now!
They're going to detonate one of the warheads on the Eiffel Tower!
Crush him!
Snake!
He's underneath. Kill him!
That redhead is really starting to piss me off.
Shit!
Oh, God!
I got you. I got you.
-Nice save, slick. -Come on,
-Nice save, slick. -Come on, don't start being all nice to me now. Gotta go.
Get in!
All right, Rip, let's take this thing down! Hang on, Snake!
Try this on for size, boys.
Oh, shit!
(GROANS) DUKE ON RADIO: We lost them!
Cut through that building across the street.
-DUKE: Where's the door? -Make one!
Right! Come on, Rip!
I'm coming. I'm coming!
I don't have them! Where are they?
-They're evacuating the Tower. -We're only 2 kilometers away.
Snake, we're running out of time. You gotta do something.
It's now or never.
He gave up. He never gives up.
(SCREAMS) Coming through!
(RIP LAUGHS) DUKE: Okay, that was crazy. I didn't expect that.
-What happened to you? -I went through the train.
What happened to you? -I jumped over it. -You can do that?
-I jumped over it. -You can do that? Yeah. I told you to read that manual.
There's a manual?
Next time, I'll drive.
Here. Take the kill switch.
Come on. Get out of the way!
BREAKER: Hey, guys, they're alive and they're on the move.
And they've activated the warhead. I'm tracking the kill switch now.
Duke! Duke, it's on the Baroness!
Storm Shadow has one of the warheads, and it's armed!
Get out of my way! Get out!
Get out!
Nice shoes.
You get the warhead, I'll get the kill switch.
Yeah, I'm on it.
RIP: Damn, that ninja's fast!
Oh, no!
HEAVY: Bloody hell. No.
They're gonna eat through the entire city.
Duke, you have to hit that kill switch!
Oh, God.
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Disarmed.
Congratulations, Duke. You just saved Paris.
Or at least most of it.
Is that blood? Spaghetti sauce. Don't ask.
-They got Duke. -We know.
(STAMMERING) What are you doing? Plugging into his cerebral cortex.
I hate to break the news to you,
but I don't think he's gonna give you much in his dead condition.
The brain survives a couple of minutes after death.
We can retrieve the electrical impulses from his most recent memories
and convert them to images. Well, can we find Duke?
We need to find the other three warheads first.
If this guy remembers his way home, maybe we can find both.
Okay, here come the images. Let's see where this guy's been.
-He's still alive. -He can't be, he's got needles in his head.
Hey, dead guys don't break-dance. -What's happening -Nanomites, they're getting to him.
-What's happening -Nanomites, they're getting to him.
How much time till he self destructs? -Hurry, Breaker. -I'm on it.
-Hurry, Breaker. -I'm on it.
No, no!
No, no, no!
DOCTOR: The beauty of nanotechnology.
-RIP: We are screwed. -Relax. I got everything I could.
What? Then what the hell was the, "No, no, no, no!" for?
That was for McCullen. They were watching us.
That was for McCullen. They were watching us. Okay. So what did you get?
Actually, not that much. Just images.
Come on, Frenchie. I thought you said you was the best at this.
-I am the best at this! -All right.
-Nobody can do what I just did. -Okay.
Wait, no.
We didn't do it. We're the good guys.
-Put your hands up, Rip. -We don't have time for this!
HEAVY: We're not allowed to engage with friendly forces.
RIP: They don't look too friendly to me. I gotta get my boy.
-Look, Captain... -Rip!
We're still trying to locate the three remaining warheads, sir.
What's the status of the Joes? They've been detained.
The French are pretty upset. Of course they're upset.
Get me the French Ambassador.
(MAN SPEAKING FRENCH ON TV) ...in a matter of seconds by a strike by a missile...
Hey, no, no! (SPEAKING FRENCH)
Please don't touch that! That's my equipment. It's very... (MACHINE POWERING DOWN)
Okay, he's touching it.
Nice going, slick. It's not his fault.
He's just emotional.
-Here, let me look at that. -I'm fine.
Just trying to help. General!
The French have agreed to let you all go on the condition that none of you return.
-Ever. -Never?
-Ever. -Never? It could be worse.
What do you mean by never? Like, never, never, ever?
There's more.
All of you have been recalled by your respective heads of state.
Team Alpha is to return to the Pit.
What about Duke?
ANA: Call McCullen. Tell him we have the three warheads.
NEO-VIPER: Right away.
Why didn't you just kill me?
McCullen has something special in mind for you.
McCullen.
What happened to you?
Now you care?
Okay.
I am sorry.
I'm sorry about Rex.
I'm sorry that I couldn't bring Rex home.
And I'm so sorry that I couldn't face you afterwards.
Well, everybody's sorry about something.
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)
Master!
Master.
Okay, so what about Duke? We're just gonna forget about him?
HEAVY: We've got our orders.
RIP: Look, man, what if it was one of your guys?
What if it was Scarlett or Breaker? What would you do then?
Looks pretty remote. Might be a good location for a base.
Snow. That leaves us with what, a third of the earth?
Yeah.
Hey, is that McCullen's shadow? -What you got? -Spherical trigonometry.
-What you got? -Spherical trigonometry. I must have missed that class.
If you know the height of the object, the length of the shadow,
and the time and date that the image was captured,
you can figure out its location. That's why I missed that class.
HEAVY: All right, Breaker, give it to me. What have we got?
Okay. McCullen is 180 centimeters tall. His shadow is 46 centimeters.
This image has decayed 6%,
which means it's 51 hours and 17 minutes old.
That's at the polar icecap.
-Heavy. -Yep.
What do you say, sir?
I said you've been ordered back to the Pit,
but I didn't say when and I didn't say which route to take.
Maybe a northern one.
HEAVY: That is a lot of ice.
BREAKER: Thousands of miles across and 10 stories thick.
Locating McCullen's base will be like finding a needle in a coal mine.
Haystack. Oh, right.
Haystack in a coal mine.
No! McCullen has plans for him!
Enough!
And what was your plan?
Run 3,000 miles across the ice?
Stupid soldier.
NEO-VIPER: Move it.
-That's strange. -What?
When they stole the weapons case, I set my scanner
to look out for the tracking beacon in case it came back on.
And it just came back on. That's my boy!
Three left.
Take the warheads to the missiles. I want them ready to launch in one hour.
It will be done.
My beautiful Lady of the Lake.
This bother you?
It's funny, isn't it? The entire balance of power in the world about to shift,
two guys can still have a stare-down over who gets the girl.
(COUGHS) I'm gonna make you very unhappy.
-I'm already unhappy. -NEO-VIPER: Get up!
BREAKER: Video from the Aqua Cam is coming online now.
HEAVY: Bloody hell.
They've built a military base under the polar icecap.
It's the perfect location. Nearly undetectable, easily defensible.
Duke's got to be in there somewhere. And the warheads.
We have to find a quiet way to get inside.
Elevator cables. They've got a surface entrance.
BREAKER: Guys, there's something else. Going to sonar view.
They've got tunnels running through the ice pack.
SCARLETT: Hey, look, they've got their own attack subs.
Okay, what's that?
BREAKER: Missile tubes. HEAVY: Must be for the nanomite warheads.
Take us up. I'll create a distraction from outside and keep them busy
while you lot infiltrate the facility from above. We'll find Duke...
-Grab the warheads. -Kill all the bad guys.
As you all know, Team Alpha is under direct orders
to return to their respective national bases.
But I have something I need to do which goes against all orders.
So, if any of you decide that you have to leave now,
I will certainly not hold it against you.
Okay, then.
DUKE: What are you gonna do with the warheads?
You take to your training well. That's good.
Still trying to develop intel.
So you won't mind telling me. Isn't it obvious? I'm a businessman. I'm going to use them.
Isn't it obvious? I'm a businessman. I'm going to use them.
Millions of people are gonna die if you launch those warheads,
so what is it that you want?
To strike fear into the hearts of every man, woman and child on the planet.
Then they'll turn to the person with the most power.
You?
No, not me. You're not seeing the whole picture.
-Then tell me. -I don't wanna spoil the surprise.
DOCTOR: Ah! Guests.
Meet the genius behind all my nanotechnology.
Genius? You are too kind.
As you can see, we are loading my nanomite warheads
into the high-V missiles.
Once at maximum velocity, Mach 5,
not even the Joes have the technology to catch them.
So, who's this? Another recruit?
Albeit a rather unwilling one.
I'll prepare him for the procedure.
All teams, listen up, this is General Hawk.
The mission is a go. I say again, the mission is a go.
Good luck, Joes.
The teams have been deployed, sir. Get me a satellite uplink.
I wanna see everything that's going on down there.
NEO-VIPER 1: You picking up anything?
NEO-VIPER 2: Negative. There's nothing on the scanner.
-RIP: Nice shooting. -SCARLETT: Thank you.
We're a long way from Miami.
SCARLETT: Whoa. That's a Night Raven. They actually built one.
Looks fast. That McCullen got some gadgets.
DOCTOR: MARS Industries manufactures 70% of all arms on this planet.
70%.
Did you know that, Duke?
There are two sides to McCullen's operation, the Sword and the Shield.
The Sword creates and sells weaponry.
The Shield creates defensive technology, like high-tech bunkers,
which are supposed to protect one from anything
from a nuclear blast to a nanomite warhead.
Unfortunately, the bunker in which I took shelter
was just a prototype.
Who are you?
Rex?
You son of a bitch! Ana buried you!
Moving ceremony, I'm sure.
The three-volley salute.
Boots on the ground. A folded flag in her arms.
Why? Why didn't you just come in?
Because I discovered something.
MINDBENDER ON MONITOR: ...subject number 23.
This will only hurt a little.
What comes next, more so.
McCULLEN: Listen, Mindbender, do whatever it takes.
So will I.
Remember, science requires sacrifice.
(MAN SCREAMING) It's beautiful, isn't it? Stay where you are!
Are you going to shoot me?
(MAN CONTINUES SCREAMING) These aren't chemical or nuclear, are they?
No.
They're something much, much better.
It is beautiful.
Nanomites, it's beyond...
It's light years ahead of what anyone else is doing in the field.
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Proximity alert.
Aerial attack imminent. All personnel to the bunker.
(ALARM BLARING) Come on. Come on! What?
What are you doing? Don't close that. Don't...
If we live, I'll show you everything.
(BEEPING) We survived that blast, somewhat.
And Dr. Mindbender and I escaped with his research, which I perfected
and which you will now experience first-hand.
Does Ana know about this? About you?
(LAUGHS) No, and she never will.
Commence the launch sequence.
MAN ON PA: Commencing launch sequence. T-minus four, three, two, one.
Ignite primary engines.
(RUMBLING) We have ignition.
RIP: They're launching the missiles!
MAN 1 ON PA: We lost the Beijing missile. Warhead three is down, sir.
-Alert all defenses. -MAN 2: Yes, sir.
He's here.
What about the other two? We gotta find the kill switches.
They're already way too far out of range.
Somebody has to get up there and shoot those things down.
Well, I guess that's me.
-MAN: Sir. -What is it?
STRATCOM is tracking three warheads
that have just launched off the polar icecap.
One was downed immediately.
The other two are currently entering the upper atmosphere.
MAN: We need to get you down to the bunker, sir.
Well, they haven't made any demands. What's their plan?
Now, this is very cool.
-Yeah, but can you fly it? -I can fly anything.
You just find a way to guide me to those warheads.
Right. Ripcord... Yeah?
-Good luck. -Thanks.
-Hey, do me a favor. -Yeah?
Save Duke. You got it.
SCARLETT: Let's go!
The floor is pressure-plated and laser-protected.
Anything larger than a quarter that touches that floor gets fried.
DOCTOR: You left me for dead, Duke, and look at me.
Now you'll know what it's like to be a monster.
-We don't have much time. -Ana?
Oh, my God.
Ana! Security, to the operating chamber!
-Rex! -I press this, she dies.
You did this to your own sister! I loved my sister.
Do you have any idea the state she was in with me dead, you gone?
Have you ever felt truly alone?
I gave her a way to deal with the pain. I gave her purpose.
You could have stopped all of this just by letting her know you were alive!
Science requires sacrifice.
All she's done was because of you!
And because of you, Duke. You abandoned her.
Let's not forget that point. DUKE: I'm gonna kill you, Rex.
-Is she still alive? -DOCTOR: For now.
I thought we had complete control. You said this couldn't happen.
DOCTOR: I didn't think it could.
I've never seen anyone override the programming, even momentarily.
She did this for him.
The pain must have been excruciating.
What you'll have to do
is to rewire the laser panel's brain by carefully...
Or you can just stab it. This is Scarlett. We're in.
Deploy the SHARCs!
WOMAN 1 ON RADIO: Detaching SHARCs 1-3...
MAN ON RADIO: Detaching SHARCs Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta.
Full speed ahead. WOMAN 2 ON RADIO: Detaching SHARCs.
MAN 2 ON RADIO: SHARCs Victor, Franklin, Tango into flanking positions.
HEAVY: All right, boys. Attack formation.
NEO-VIPER: Fan out. Wait until the Joes break formation.
Stay tight. Here they come.
Fire up the pulse cannon! MAN ON INTERCOM: We're on it, sir.
-I'll do it! -Put it down!
DOCTOR: Your choice, Duke.
MAN: Charging pulse cannon.
Everybody stay tight on the enemy craft.
Don't let that cannon catch you out in the open.
MAN ON RADIO: Bogey at 10 o'clock.
I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm hit!
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Missile 2, all telemetry and propulsion systems nominal. (SCARLETT WHISTLES)
-Ripcord, can you hear me? -RIP: Loud and clear, buddy.
Doing Mach 6 and loving it!
Come on, girl. Time to show me what you got.
Okay, Rip, I have the coordinates of the other two warheads.
The closest target is Moscow. You'll have to hit that one first.
Target two is Washington.
You'll be safe down in this bunker, sir.
How soon before it strikes the city? Seventeen minutes, sir.
PRESIDENT: It's all up to the Joes now. MAN: Please hurry, Mr. President.
We need to get you buttoned up.
(PEOPLE SHOUTING) MAN ON PA: General Hawk, we've lost our engines. We're completely disabled.
Somebody take out that damn cannon. There's 200 Joes on that sub.
We're on it, sir. All right, Snake,
the cannon control room should be right there,
where all the laser conduits converge.
Did you think she loved you? Did you imagine your life with her?
All I know is, neither one of you deserve her.
DOCTOR: That's it. She dies! DUKE: Don't do it, Rex!
Come on. (GASPS)
I'm gonna get you out of here.
(SCREAMING) DOCTOR: Get up!
You're coming with me.
BREAKER: Ripcord, the Moscow missile will impact in four minutes.
All right, I got a visual on it.
Dead ahead.
You have to knock it down before it re-enters the atmosphere.
If those nanomites hit the ground, it's all over.
They'll destroy the whole city.
Houston, we have a problem.
The fire controls are not in here. What do you mean, not in there?
I mean, I don't see them anywhere.
It must be voice-activated.
Okay. Fire!
Shoot! Blast away! Bust a cap!
Nothing's happening! I bet it's in a different language.
Wait a minute. McCullen is Scottish. Maybe the plane responds to Celtic.
-Try Teine. -What?
Teine. It's Celt, Scottish for fire. Okay, got it. (SPEAKS CELTIC)
Nice going, ace. You just saved Moscow.
Just doing my job. Now guide me to Washington.
MAN: Yeah. Yeah, thanks, that's great news. I'll let him know.
Sir, one of the Joes shot down the warhead heading for Moscow.
Thank God.
What are you doing? Oh, my God!
It's done.
MAN: Hello, Mr. President. Mr. McCullen sends his regards.
Oh, my God.
So, that's what this is all about.
All right. Keep tight, boys.
All guns on that cannon. Torpedoes away!
(MAN SCREAMING) HEAVY: I've just lost my wingman.
WOMAN: Retargeting Joe submarine.
HEAVY: I've got a shot.
(POWERING DOWN) ELECTRONIC VOICE: Pulse cannon fault. Pulse cannon fault.
Cannon now offline.
MAN 1: The whole damn system's down. MAN 2: I'm trying to bring it back online.
Now you die.
DOCTOR: Launch immediately.
-Chart a course to the ice pack. -NEO-VIPER: Yes, sir.
We gotta go after Rex and McCullen. ANA: How could it be Rex?
Hey, Scarlett, it's Duke!
-He looks fine. -But what's he doing with her?
Okay, we got a track on McCullen's sub. He's headed up into the ice pack.
(ALARM BEEPING) Duke, behind us!
Looks like they're onto us. Ana, shoot those guys.
Love to.
When our master was killed, you took a vow of silence.
Now you will die without a word.
All right, the second one in my sights.
Okay, Rip, you only got 30 seconds before it enters the lower atmosphere.
I got you!
-Ripcord, you missed. -The warhead has entered the lower atmosphere.
RIP: I know, I know! I'm on it, I'm on it!
Shit!
-I can't shake these guys. -Duke, I'm out!
All right, let's see what we got here. ELECTRONIC VOICE: Black Ray, Eliminator, LAW.
Laser Artillery Weapon. That sounds good.
-Scarlett! -Hey, Duke!
I'm going after McCullen and Rex.
You guys better get the hell out of there.
I can't. Rip has one more warhead to take down.
Rip, where is he?
The missile's just gone drone. It's going in for the kill!
NEO-VIPER: Sir, there's a hostile Mantis craft coming up behind us.
-Seal the door. -Sir.
There you are.
One got through. I hit them!
Duke! They're back!
NEO-VIPER: Going hot in three, two, one.
There's gotta be another way around to Rex and McCullen.
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Charting new course for alternate route.
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Twenty seconds until impact.
Come on, come on, come on.
You're too close, Rip! Back off!
Actually, I think I'm just about close enough.
(SPEAKS CELTIC)
He's taking the nanomites back into the upper atmosphere.
SCARLETT: Ripcord, get out of that plane!
(GRUNTING) Almost there!
Eject, Ripcord, eject! (SPEAKS CELTIC)
He did it. He actually did it.
Ripcord?
(STATIC) SCARLETT: Ripcord?
Ripcord!
RIP: Didn't I ask you not to yell at me?
(ALL CHEERING) Everybody, listen up! We still have a lot of Joes out there in harm's way.
Let's bring them home.
-RIP: Did it work? -SCARLETT: Yes, yes, it worked.
Good. Because I think I'm about to get arrested, again.
MAN 1: Don't move!
-Hey, hey, same team, same team! -MAN 2: Hands up!
Same team. Okay, okay, okay.
DOCTOR: What's our status? NEO-VIPER: We've lost aft thrusters and the sonar.
-We're running blind. -Kill them. Kill all the Joes.
Detonate the ice pack. Right away, sir.
They're telling the other ships to abort. He's gonna blow the ice pack.
This is Duke calling all Joes. The ice pack's coming down!
There's a ton of steel and ice
-headed your way! -What?
Everybody, pull back! Pull back now!
Door! The door, the door! Get the door!
Come on!
Ana, we could get out of here right now, free and clear, safe and sound.
Let's get them. That's my girl.
This is cutting it close, Duke. I'm not letting those two get away.
Come on, guys, get out of there!
Snake!
This is Scarlett. We're all clear. This is Duke. We're clear, too.
Yo, Joe!
MEN: Yeah!
DOCTOR: Now that we have a moment to ourselves,
-I've designed something especially for you, James. -No!
This will only hurt a little. (GROANING)
What comes next, more so.
Nanomites, perfect little healers.
I've finally taken my place in a long line of McCullens.
James McCullen is no more. Now you are Destro.
What have you done to me?
The time has come for the cobra to rise up and reveal himself.
You will call me Commander.
This is Captain Duke Hauser. Prepare to be boarded.
NEO-VIPER: Sir.
DOCTOR: You are relentless, Duke. I'll give you that much.
And what's to stop me from blowing you out of the water?
Self-preservation. I'm taking you in, Rex.
You and what army?
My army.
DOCTOR: You know, Duke, this has only just begun.
I'll be waiting for you.
(DEVICE BEEPING) HUNDTKINDER: I've never seen encoding like this. I mean, physically, she's fine,
but when Rex programmed them, he sure didn't want them taken out.
So there's nothing you can do for her? It'll take some time, but we'll take them out.
It'll take some time, but we'll take them out.
Till we get those things out of your head,
looks like you're gonna be seeing a lot of me around here.
You can't save me, Duke. No one can, not after all I've done.
Look, that wasn't you.
I'm not giving up on you.
Man, we look good. Yeah, well, you better get used to it.
HAWK: Heavy Duty thinks you guys ought to stick around permanently.
DUKE: So, you're asking us, right?
Yeah, 'cause he didn't sound like he was asking.
'Cause you gotta be asked to join the G.I. Joes.
'Cause you gotta be asked to join the G.I. Joes. I'm asking.
Well, I'm in.
How do you feel about this? I feel very emotional.
MAN ON PA: All Joes mobilize  and ready check for  Operation Mongoose.
All ground transports, rendezvous at Base Brothers Grimm.
All Howler Hunters will rendezvous at Base Roman Ruin.
Good luck, Joes.
WOMAN: Mr. President, it's good to see you.
Thank you. And you. It's nice to have you back safely, sir.
